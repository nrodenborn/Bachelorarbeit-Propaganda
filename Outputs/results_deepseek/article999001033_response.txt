Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text labels Omar Smith's statements as "racist statements" and explicitly quotes him using the racial slur "cracker state" against white voters.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The headline "Caught on video: Gillum staffer makes racist statements and admits campaign is lying to voters" is repeated verbatim at the start of the text. The phrase "that will never happen" is also repeated regarding Gillum's platform promises.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: While phrases like "modern-day fairy tales start with ‘once I am elected’" are used, they are presented as quotes from the staffer describing the campaign's deception, not as brief, memorable phrases used *by the article itself* to promote its own message.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text instills fear that voters are being deliberately lied to ("admits campaign is lying to voters", "revealing Gillum’s campaign promises are lies") and that their state is dysfunctional ("f***ed up ass state").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text explicitly questions the credibility of Andrew Gillum and his campaign by presenting video evidence where a staffer states campaign promises are lies ("admitting they are lies") and that Gillum hides unpopular positions ("he’s not saying specifically... only because he’s running a race right now").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Describing Florida as a "f***ed up ass state" and a "cracker state" constitutes exaggeration. Minimization is not prominently featured.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not appeal to patriotism or a specific national/group identity to support its point. It focuses on alleged campaign dishonesty and racism.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text uses highly charged, emotionally negative language throughout: "racist statements", "lying to voters", "f***ed up", "cracker state", "whip them up into a frenzy", "crazy crazy crazies", "eviscerating Gillum", "demean white voters".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not attempt to disapprove of Gillum's ideas by associating them with groups hated by the audience (e.g., Nazis, terrorists).
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not argue that Gillum's ideas should be rejected or supported based on their popularity. It focuses on alleged deception and offensive statements.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text presents the Republican-controlled legislature as the sole, simple reason Gillum's promises "will never happen," ignoring other potential factors (e.g., negotiation, public pressure, future election changes).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is direct and uses specific quotes and accusations ("raise the corporate tax...", "raise teachers’ pay...", "Medicare for all", "using a racial slur"). It does not rely on vague or obscure language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text cites Project Veritas and its President, James O'Keefe, as authorities whose video evidence and statement ("The video evidence confirms...", "said Project Veritas Action President James O’Keefe") are used to validate the claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not present only two extreme options as the only possibilities. It focuses on specific accusations of lying and racism.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: While the text uses strong language, it doesn't employ phrases specifically designed to shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is", "that's just common sense"). It invites scrutiny through presented evidence.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the core allegations against the Gillum campaign (lying about platform, racist statements, hidden gun control stance). It does not introduce significantly irrelevant material to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text quotes the staffer refuting Gillum's *actual* stated platform promises ("Raise the corporate tax... that will never happen..."). It does not refute a misrepresented or non-existent argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not charge Gillum or his campaign with hypocrisy by pointing to the alleged misdeeds of others. It focuses solely on the actions and statements attributed to Gillum's campaign.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques, making it highly likely to be propaganda. Its primary purpose is not balanced reporting but to damage Andrew Gillum's campaign through selective presentation. Key indicators include: **Repetition** of the damning headline; **Name Calling** ("racist statements", "cracker state"); **Loaded Language** throughout ("lying", "f***ed up", "whip them up", "eviscerating"); **Appeal to Fear** (voters being lied to, state dysfunction); creating **Doubt** about Gillum's honesty; **Causal Oversimplification** regarding policy feasibility; and **Appeal to Authority** (Project Veritas/O'Keefe). While based on actual video footage and quotes, the text frames them aggressively, omits context or response, and uses highly emotive language clearly intended to provoke outrage and persuade the audience against Gillum, rather than neutrally inform. The concluding rhetorical questions ("Will there be wall-to-wall coverage...?", "Will Gillum be asked to denounce...?") further signal an agenda-driven appeal. The presence of multiple core propaganda techniques strongly indicates a propagandistic intent.
