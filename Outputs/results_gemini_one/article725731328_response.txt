Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack subjects, such as calling the media the "left-wing enemedia" and Louis Farrakhan a "vicious jihad-supporting racist."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the quote from the photographer, Askia Muhammad, stating that the photo’s release “absolutely would have made a difference.” It also repeats a quote from Louis Farrakhan: “The Jews don’t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that’s a good name. Hitler was a very great man.”

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text links Barack Obama to figures and groups described with terms like "jihad," "terror group," and "vicious... racist." It also lists quotes from Farrakhan threatening the destruction of America, creating fear by association.

Doubt – Yes – The text is built around casting doubt on the integrity of Barack Obama and the media, for example: "The left-wing enemedia worked as furiously to cover up, censor and sanction Barack Hussein Obama’s jihad and violent left-wing connections..."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to frame its narrative, such as describing "The Obama Administration’s War on America."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the subject as a "War on America" and by quoting an individual who says, "My god will wipe this country (America) from the face of the earth," implicitly positioning the author and reader as defenders of the nation.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to evoke a strong reaction, such as "enemedia," "jihad," "nefarious connections," and "wicked deceivers."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text heavily features quotes from Louis Farrakhan where he praises Hitler, such as "Hitler was a very great man." By repeatedly quoting this, the author links Farrakhan (and by association, Obama) to a figure universally hated by the audience to discredit them.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is true because it is popular; in fact, it argues the opposite, that a truth has been hidden from the majority.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text implies that the hiding of a single photograph was a key reason for Obama's political success, simplifying the complex factors of a presidential election. The quote "It absolutely would have made a difference" is presented as definitive proof of this.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; its accusations are direct and its language, while loaded, is not intentionally unclear.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites her own book as a source of information ("I detailed Obama’s nefarious connections... in my book"). It also presents the photographer, Askia Muhammad, as an authority on the photo's potential political impact.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text creates a stark contrast between two sides with no middle ground: the "left-wing enemedia" who "manufacture and make up lies to destroy President Trump" versus the author and her readers who are aware of the "truth" about Obama.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; instead, it uses inflammatory language to provoke a specific line of thought.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces President Trump early on: "...as they do to manufacture and make up lies to destroy President Trump." This is irrelevant to the core claim about a 2005 photo of Obama but serves to distract and frame the issue for a contemporary political audience.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or invent an opponent's argument to refute it; instead, it makes direct accusations about actions and associations.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy. While it mentions President Trump, it does so to establish a pattern of media behavior rather than as a direct "what about..." response to a specific criticism.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt an extremely negative view of Barack Obama, the media, and the Nation of Islam. It achieves this by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. The piece strategically combines factual elements (the existence of the photograph, the identity of the photographer, direct quotes from Farrakhan) with a narrative saturated with Name Calling ("enemedia," "vicious... racist"), Loaded Language ("jihad," "nefarious"), and Appeals to Fear. The core argument relies on guilt by association, linking Obama to Farrakhan, and then thoroughly demonizing Farrakhan using his own words, particularly his praise for Hitler (Reduction ad Hitlerum). The inclusion of President Trump serves as a Red Herring to engage a specific political base, and the entire narrative is framed within a Black & White Fallacy of a corrupt media establishment versus truth-tellers like the author. The overwhelming presence of these techniques in service of a biased political goal, rather than objective reporting, confirms its status as propaganda.
