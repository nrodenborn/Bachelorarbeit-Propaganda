1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels a Democratic candidate as a “pro-jihad Marxist Democrat” and describes Democrats in general as “insane in their lust for power.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?” is repeated three times in a row.

3. Slogans – No – The text uses charged phrases but does not employ a distinct, repeatable slogan.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text claims that Democrats “will destroy even our democratic system to get” power, instilling fear about the future of the country if Democrats are successful.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire premise of the introductory commentary is to cast doubt on the legitimacy of election results, stating “The Democrats are committing voter fraud on a massive scale.” The quoted article also reports on an official investigation, which by its nature questions the credibility of the actions taken.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text claims Democrats are committing voter fraud on a “massive scale” and across multiple states, exaggerating a specific, localized investigation in Florida into a nationwide conspiracy.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a need to protect “our democratic system” from being destroyed and to uphold “the will of the people.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical terms like “pro-jihad Marxist,” “insane,” and “lust for power” to evoke a strong emotional reaction from the reader.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of a Democratic candidate by labeling her a “pro-jihad Marxist Democrat,” suggesting she is aligned with groups (jihadists, Marxists) that are hated and feared by the target audience.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular or that the reader should join a majority.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes complex election outcomes, where multiple candidates were in close races, to a single, simple cause: a “massive scale” voter fraud scheme by Democrats.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text, particularly in its commentary section, is direct and clear in its accusations, even if they are exaggerated.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author makes broad claims and then uses a lengthy quote from a *Politico* article that cites “federal prosecutors” and the “Florida Department of State” to lend credibility and authority to the accusations.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll about Jim Acosta presents a false dichotomy in its answers: “Yes, he should have gotten it back” versus “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass,” framing the “No” option in a biased way and ignoring nuance. The overall narrative also presents a false choice between accepting the author's view or siding with those who would "destroy our democratic system."

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “overturn the will of the people” is used to frame any challenge to an election result as inherently illegitimate, discouraging nuanced discussion about the legal process of recounts and ballot curing.

16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about CNN reporter Jim Acosta, inserted into the middle of an article about Florida election fraud, is completely irrelevant to the topic and serves only to distract the reader or engage them on a separate, emotionally charged issue.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text claims Democrats want to “destroy even our democratic system.” This misrepresents the opposing argument, which would be that Democrats want to ensure all legal votes are counted to *uphold* the democratic system. The text refutes a fabricated, nefarious motive instead of the actual position.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses its attack on one group (Democrats) and does not deflect criticism by pointing out hypocrisy in others.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its structure is particularly manipulative: it sandwiches a factual news report from a credible source (*Politico*) between layers of highly biased, inflammatory, and unsubstantiated commentary. This technique, an appeal to authority, is designed to make the author's extreme claims seem more credible by association. The text heavily employs a wide array of propaganda techniques, including name-calling (“pro-jihad Marxist”), appeal to fear (“destroy our democratic system”), exaggeration (“massive scale” fraud), and causal oversimplification. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Jim Acosta poll) further demonstrates that the article's primary purpose is not to inform, but to manipulate the reader's emotions, reinforce a specific political narrative, and solidify an "us vs. them" mentality. The goal is to persuade and inflame, not to present a balanced or factual account of events.
