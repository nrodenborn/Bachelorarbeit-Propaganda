### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Technique Use**: Employs 11/18 propaganda methods, including loaded language, fear appeals, repetition, and causal oversimplification. These are concentrated in the first half to vilify Omar and Democrats.  
2. **Dehumanization & Stereotyping**: Reduces Omar to a "hijab-wearing Muslim" tied to "Jew-hatred," leveraging religious/ethnic bias. The marriage allegation (a red herring) further paints her as morally corrupt.  
3. **Partisan Demonization**: Frames Democrats as embracing "hateful views" and sacrificing integrity for identity politics (*"She is a Muslim and a leftist, so she can further their identity politics"*).  
4. **Emotional Manipulation**: The poll uses repetition and fear ("caravan of migrants") to provoke knee-jerk reactions, while phrases like "shameful" and "evil" inflame sentiment.  
5. **Source Bias**: Relies on PJ Media and Pamela Geller—outlets known for far-right, anti-Muslim content—without independent verification.  
6. **Intent to Polarize**: Designed to delegitimize Omar/Democrats through oversimplified religious/cultural attacks (e.g., linking Quran to Jew-hatred ignores theological diversity) and distract from policy issues.  

**Why not 100%?**  
The article references a specific marriage claim (though unverified), offering a thin veneer of factual pretense. However, its overwhelming reliance on manipulative techniques, bigoted tropes, and partisan aggression confirms propaganda.
