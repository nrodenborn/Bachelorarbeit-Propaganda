Name calling – Yes – The text uses the term "infamous 'Gang of Eight'" to apply a negative label to a political group, associating them with notoriety and disgrace.

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly mentions that ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack ("claim over and over," "never claimed responsibility for attacks they were not involved in," "claimed responsibility four times") and that there is "credible evidence" of a terrorist link.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as slogans.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text directly connects a mass shooting to "terrorist infiltration through the southern border," instilling fear that foreign terrorists are easily entering the country to commit acts of violence.

Doubt – Yes – The entire text is structured to create doubt about the official investigation. It uses rhetorical questions like "Why is that?" and statements like "Something’s not adding up" to question the credibility of the official narrative.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text makes the exaggerated claim that "the Islamic State has never claimed responsibility for attacks they were not involved in" to lend more weight to their claims about the Las Vegas shooting.

Flag-Waving – No – While the text discusses national security and the US border, it does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like "terrorist infiltration," "deadly attack," and "jihadis" to evoke strong emotional responses from the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that the idea is popular. Instead, it presents its claims as a hidden truth that goes against the mainstream narrative.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause-and-effect relationship: lax border security (blaming the "Gang of Eight") directly led to the Las Vegas shooting, which is a vast oversimplification of a complex event and an unproven claim.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The central piece of evidence is repeatedly referred to as "credible evidence" by Congressman Perry, but the text never explains what that evidence actually is, keeping it deliberately vague.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text relies on the statements of "Representative Scott Perry (R-PA)" and the "SITE Intel Group" as authorities to support its claims and lend them credibility.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as having only two possibilities: either the official "lone gunman" story is true, or the "terrorist infiltration" story is true, ignoring any other potential explanations for the perceived inconsistencies.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like "Something’s not adding up" and "None of this is really that surprising" are used to reinforce the author's viewpoint and discourage critical thought about the author's own claims.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the lengthy topic of the "Gang of Eight" and a past immigration deal. This distracts from the central argument about the Las Vegas shooting and shifts the focus to a separate political grievance about border security.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent a specific counter-argument in order to refute it. It primarily casts doubt and ignores the official narrative rather than distorting it.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any opponent of hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It is not an objective news report but a persuasive article constructed using numerous propaganda techniques to promote a specific, unsubstantiated conspiracy theory. The entire piece is built on a foundation of **doubt** ("Something's not adding up"), **appeal to fear** ("terrorist infiltration"), and **appeal to authority** (a congressman's claims). It uses **obfuscation** by constantly referring to "credible evidence" without ever presenting it, and it introduces a **red herring** (the "Gang of Eight") to distract from the lack of direct evidence and to link the event to a separate political issue. The use of **loaded language**, **repetition**, and a **black & white fallacy** further serves to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions. The goal is to undermine trust in official institutions and advance a political agenda regarding border security and terrorism by linking it to a national tragedy.
