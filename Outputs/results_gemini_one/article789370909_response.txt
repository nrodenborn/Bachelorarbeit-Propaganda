Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. It does not present a balanced or objective account of the events but rather constructs a one-sided narrative with the explicit goal of persuading the reader to support Judge Kavanaugh and oppose his critics. It employs a wide array of propaganda techniques, including loaded language ("salacious," "smears," "bludgeon"), name-calling ("Kavanaugh haters," "Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome"), and constant efforts to cast doubt on the accusers' credibility. The piece uses flag-waving by appealing to core American legal principles like "due process" and "innocent until proven guilty" to frame its argument as a defense of national values. Furthermore, it utilizes logical fallacies like the straw man, causal oversimplification, and red herring to attack opponents and dismiss their arguments. The overwhelming presence of these techniques, combined with the highly emotional tone and the clear political objective of ensuring a specific confirmation vote, indicates that the text's primary purpose is not to inform but to influence and manipulate opinion.
