### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to systematic use of manipulative techniques. Key indicators:  
- **Fear-mongering**: Framing migrants as an "invasion" (Name Calling, Appeal to Fear) implies a militarized threat, justifying extreme measures like troops and razor wire.  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded language ("brutal force," "predominantly young men") and Flag-Waving stoke nationalism and xenophobia.  
- **Repetition & Authority**: Redundant poll questions amplify divisiveness, while appeals to Trump/military lend false legitimacy.  
- **Selective framing**: Exaggerates migrant demographics (ignoring families) and troop deployments (comparing to war zones), while downplaying caravan dissolution and humanitarian context.  

The text serves a political agenda (noted midterm election timing) by dehumanizing migrants and portraying border reinforcement as heroic. Though factual elements exist (e.g., troop numbers), their presentation is distorted to provoke fear and loyalty. Absence of neutral sources or migrant perspectives further confirms propagandistic intent.
