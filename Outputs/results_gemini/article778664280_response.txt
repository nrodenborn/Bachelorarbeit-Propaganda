1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack opponents, for example by describing the actions of some bishops as "gross dereliction of duty" and "willful deception," which are attacks on their character and competence.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the core message that the Church has a "constant and unchanging moral teaching" on homosexuality that modern bishops are failing to uphold, using phrases like "binding and constant teaching," "Church's clear teaching," and "traditional Catholic teaching" to hammer the point home.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the memorable, pejorative phrase "Church of Accompaniment" to label and dismiss the modern pastoral approach it opposes.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that if the bishops' current approach continues, "everlasting damnation is the price to be paid for this kind of inclusivity," and that "McCarrick will become the norm, not the exception," instilling fear about the spiritual and practical consequences of not adopting the author's view.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the motives and credibility of Church leaders, asking rhetorical questions like, "So why are our bishops playing dumb?" and "Who are these bishops that think they can play fast and loose not only with the moral theology of the Catholic Church, but also with the immortal souls of their flock?"
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by calling Pope John Paul II "THE GREAT" to amplify his authority. Archbishop Hebda's statement also minimizes the significance of past settlements by stating they were "apparently considered ancient history."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a shared Catholic identity by addressing "good Catholics" and "the faithful of this archdiocese," creating an in-group that shares the author's concerns and values, which is a form of identity-based appeal similar to patriotism.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to provoke a strong reaction, such as "horrific scandal," "hideous violation," "ideology of evil," and "forces of darkness."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by associating it with Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text argues against what it portrays as the popular modern trend (e.g., "political correctness," "spirit of our 'most enlightened' age") rather than suggesting its own ideas are popular and should be followed for that reason.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for the complex sexual abuse crisis, stating, "Until the Church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The Remnant Comment section of the text is direct and explicit in its accusations and demands, not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on the authority of "Sacred Scripture," the "Catechism of the Catholic Church," and especially "Pope John Paul 'The GREAT'" to validate its arguments and present them as unchallengeable.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either a full-throated reaffirmation of a specific interpretation of moral teaching, or a complete surrender to an "ideology of evil" that will lead to "everlasting damnation." This ignores any potential for nuanced pastoral approaches.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Archbishop Hebda uses the phrase "where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more" to provide a simple, faith-based conclusion to a complex problem. The Remnant Comment uses "It is not" as a blunt, discussion-ending refutation of a pastoral option.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text uses Archbishop Hebda's statement about the specific McCarrick scandal as a pretext to introduce a broader, different argument about the Church's general pastoral care for homosexuals, distracting from the original topic of abuse and cover-up.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified and uncharitable version of its opponents' arguments, such as the idea that bishops want to "let the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home" or that they are leaving moral decisions "up to individual parishes," which are easier to attack than the actual nuanced theological positions.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy on a different issue; instead, it directly attacks the perceived failures of bishops regarding the issue at hand.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent piece of propaganda. While the first section from Archbishop Hebda is a formal, public relations-style statement, the second and much longer "REMNANT COMMENT" section employs a vast array of propaganda techniques with high intensity. It systematically uses loaded language, appeals to fear (warning of damnation), and causal oversimplification to connect the specific McCarrick scandal to its broader ideological agenda against perceived liberalization in the Church. It constructs a black-and-white fallacy, presenting its hardline view as the only alternative to moral collapse. The argument is built on a red herring (pivoting from abuse to a culture war issue), attacks straw men versions of its opponents' views, and relentlessly uses appeals to authority to shut down debate. The purpose is not to foster understanding or dialogue, but to provoke outrage and fear, question the legitimacy of current Church leadership, and rally support for a specific, rigid theological and political faction within the Church.
