Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "imaginary Catholic Pharisees," "neo-Pharisaical escape hatches," "knowing dupes," "moral theologian (scare quotes)". These are insulting labels attacking Pope Francis and his supporters.  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The phrase "Do they think we are fools?" appears twice, and "Apparently, they think" is repeated to reinforce the core accusation.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as rallying cries (e.g., no equivalents to "BUILD THE WALL").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings of "moral subversion," an "unparalleled debacle for the Church," and future justification of contraception/homosexual unions instill fear about the consequences of Francis’s actions.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Repeatedly questions credibility: "The Cardinal knows this is moral and canonical nonsense," "Do they think we are fools?" implying deceit or incompetence.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates implications (e.g., Chiodi’s nuanced view becomes "a duty to contracept!"). Minimizes Francis’s authority by calling AL "the only document of its kind" (dismissing its significance).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to Catholic identity/tradition: "defend the Church’s teaching," "divine and natural law," "defends the Faith," "keep the Faith," positioning the author as the true defender.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms: "outrageous opinion," "moral subversion," "lie from the pit of hell," "unparalleled debacle," "ferocious attack."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity; instead positions the author as a minority resisting corruption.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Attributes issues to deliberate subversion but acknowledges complex mechanisms (e.g., canon law debates).  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Arguments are direct and explicit, not vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites Cardinal Burke and Fr. Harrison as authoritative counterweights to Francis/Müller: "Cardinal Burke... has observed the obvious," "Fr. Brian Harrison has so trenchantly observed."  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents Francis’s reforms as pure subversion vs. immutable tradition: e.g., AL enables "utter fakes" while Burke’s view is "the obvious." No middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" to shut down debate; instead invites critical engagement.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All examples directly target Francis’s policies; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents Chiodi’s argument about contraception in complex cases as declaring "a duty to contracept!" (ignoring his contextual nuances).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy; focuses solely on doctrinal criticism.  

---

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs **11/18 techniques** (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, and Straw Men) to discredit Pope Francis and his allies. The language is emotionally charged, manipulative, and dismissive of opposing viewpoints, framing dissent as "moral subversion" while positioning the author as the guardian of true Catholicism. Rhetorical questions ("Do they think we are fools?") and hyperbolic claims (e.g., "lie from the pit of hell") aim to provoke outrage rather than encourage nuanced discussion. While grounded in theological disputes, the text’s primary goal is persuasion through emotional manipulation, ad hominem attacks, and oversimplification—hallmarks of propaganda. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the specialized religious context, but the techniques dominate the narrative.
