Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **No** – No insulting labels are directly applied to opponents or alternatives. Terms like "infamous 'Gang of Eight'" are critical but function more as loaded language than direct name-calling insults.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The phrase "credible evidence" is repeated multiple times regarding terrorist infiltration and the Las Vegas connection (e.g., "credible evidence", "what I believe to be credible evidence", "what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence"). The repetition of ISIS claims (taking credit "over and over", claimed responsibility "four times") also qualifies.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – The text uses descriptive phrases ("terrorist infiltration through the southern border", "something's not adding up") but no brief, memorable, standalone slogans are present.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The core argument instills fear about terrorist infiltration across the southern border being linked to a major mass shooting (Las Vegas), implying it poses an ongoing threat that authorities are downplaying or covering up (e.g., "Credible Evidence" Of “Terrorist Infiltration Through the Southern Border” Related To Las Vegas Shooting", "potential terrorist infiltration... regarding this incident").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The text repeatedly questions the official narrative and authorities: "Why is that?" (regarding autopsy), "Why would the autopsy report be something that needs to be withheld?", "Something’s not adding up", "The investigation has been conducted... not the feds, and yet, they continue to claim...", "DHS had denied... but a local investigator produced evidence to the contrary", "the level of secrecy... is surprising".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – *Exaggeration:* The claim "the Islamic State has never claimed responsibility for attacks they were not involved in" is a significant exaggeration/falsehood, as ISIS frequently claims attacks they had no hand in. The implication that withheld autopsy/video *proves* a terrorist link is an exaggerated leap. *Minimization:* Downplaying DHS assurances ("Homeland Security waved their hand") and minimizing the complexity of the investigation/secrecy by implying nefarious motives.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While border security is mentioned, there is no explicit appeal to patriotism, national identity, or rallying around the flag within this specific text.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotionally charged or connotative terms are used throughout: "Terrorist Infiltration", "Islamic jihadis", "infamous 'Gang of Eight'", "illegal immigrants", "containment of information", "level of secrecy". These words evoke strong negative emotions and stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No attempt is made to link ideas or groups to Hitler, Nazis, or universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – There is no appeal to the popularity of the idea ("Everyone believes this...", "Join the movement..."). The focus is on alleged evidence and secrecy.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – The text heavily implies a simple cause (terrorist infiltration via the southern border) for the complex Las Vegas shooting event, based on ISIS claims and the perceived secrecy, while ignoring the lack of concrete evidence and the official findings.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Key claims rely on vague references: "credible evidence" (repeatedly mentioned but never specified), "potential terrorist infiltration... regarding this incident" (connection implied but undefined), "what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence" (subjective and undefined).
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The congressman (Rep. Scott Perry) is cited as the source of the "credible evidence" claims, lending them weight based on his position. The SITE Intel Group tweet is also used as an authoritative source for ISIS's claim.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – The text frames the understanding of the Las Vegas shooting as a choice between accepting the official "lone gunman" narrative (portrayed as suspicious and inadequate) or accepting the implied alternative of terrorist infiltration ("Something’s not adding up"). It ignores other possibilities or nuances.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Phrases like "Something’s not adding up", "It's not surprising" (in response to complex border/jihadi claims), and "None of this is really that surprising" are used to dismiss the official narrative and discourage deeper critical examination of the evidence for the alternative claim.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The discussion of the withheld autopsy report and Mandalay Bay security video, and the location of Jesus Campos, are introduced. While presented as evidence of "secrecy," these details are largely irrelevant to the specific claim of "terrorist infiltration through the southern border" being connected to the shooting. They serve to distract and build suspicion without proving the core claim.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – The text refutes the idea that authorities are *only* claiming Paddock was a "lone gunman" and that this explains the secrecy ("Yet, though they claim that Paddock was a lone gunman, they continue to withhold video... because they are still investigating other suspects"). Authorities never claimed the secrecy was *only* due to him being a lone actor; investigating potential accomplices/complicity is a standard reason for withholding evidence. The text misrepresents the official position to make it easier to attack.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not charge opponents (e.g., DHS, investigators) with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions or inconsistent positions on unrelated matters. The criticism focuses on the current case and specific past denials related directly to border security.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a very high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is not to neutrally inform but to promote a specific, alarming narrative (terrorist border infiltration linked to Las Vegas) by selectively presenting information, employing fear appeals, casting significant doubt on official accounts using irrelevant details (red herring) and vague claims (obfuscation), oversimplifying causality, using loaded language, and employing repetition and appeals to authority (the congressman) for emphasis. The reliance on logical fallacies (straw man, black & white), thought-terminating clichés, and exaggeration/minimization further demonstrates a persuasive intent aligned with propaganda rather than objective reporting or analysis. The lack of concrete evidence presented for the central claim, juxtaposed with the heavy use of these techniques, confirms its propagandistic nature. The 5% uncertainty allows for the possibility that the author genuinely believes the claims, but the *presentation* overwhelmingly uses propagandistic methods.
