1. Name calling – Yes – The Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia is called “alien” to the Catholic Faith. The current society is described as a “real neo-pagan society.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The core message about defending the “sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage” is repeated throughout the text in various forms.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the sub-heading “Raising a Common Voice” and the title of the document, “Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage,” functions as a memorable, defining phrase.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that the alternative interpretation of the Pope’s writing will spread “a plague of divorce” in the Church and is causing “rampant confusion.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is centered on a statement that questions the Pope’s interpretation of Church teaching, calling it “alien” and thereby casting doubt on its faithfulness to Catholic Tradition.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggerated language like “rampant confusion” and “plague of divorce.” It also highlights the growing number of signatories (nine) to imply significant momentum, while minimizing the context that this is a very small fraction of the world's 5,000 bishops.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a shared Catholic identity by framing the issue as a defense of “the constant truths of the Church,” the “Church’s entire faith and Tradition,” and the duty of the bishops as “Successors of the Apostles.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “alien,” “neo-pagan,” “plague,” “sexual depravity,” “rampant confusion,” “sanctity,” and “immutable truths.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with groups like Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The article emphasizes the growing number of signatories, listing them by name and title, to suggest that supporting the “Profession” is a growing movement that others should join.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests that certain pastoral norms based on *Amoris Laetitia* will directly cause “a plague of divorce,” which is a simple cause for a complex social and personal issue.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is quite clear and direct in its criticism and its own position. It accuses its opponents’ language of being vague, but is not vague itself.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on the authority of the signatories, repeatedly using their full titles like “His Excellency Marian Eleganti, auxiliary bishop of Chur” and citing their roles as “Successors of the Apostles.”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: the “immutable” and “constant” teaching of the Church, versus an “alien” interpretation that is “contrary to Divine Revelation” and an “allowance to sin,” ignoring any possibility of a valid, nuanced middle ground.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like “This is contrary to Divine Revelation” and “Profession of Immutable Truths” are used to present a position as absolute and not open to further discussion or critical thought.

16. Red herring – No – While the text provides extensive biographical details for Bishop Eleganti, this information is used to bolster his authority (an appeal to authority), not to introduce an irrelevant topic to distract from the main argument.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the pastoral approaches it opposes by simplifying them into something their proponents would not recognize, stating that concepts like “discernment” and “pastoral accompaniment” are “tantamount to an allowance to sin.”

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to discredit the Pope or his supporters by accusing them of hypocrisy on other matters.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It is not a neutral news report but an article written from a specific, partisan viewpoint (LifeSiteNews is a socially conservative publication). It exclusively presents one side of a complex internal Church debate, using a significant number of propaganda techniques—including loaded language, appeal to fear, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy—to persuade the reader to adopt its position. The primary goal appears to be rallying support for a dissenting faction within the Church and undermining the authority of the Pope’s pastoral guidance, rather than providing a balanced and objective account of the event.
