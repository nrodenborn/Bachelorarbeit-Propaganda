Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "illegal black ops operation" (used to describe Haspel's actions).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "whatever it takes" repeated twice.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "whatever it takes" and "enough is enough" serve as brief, memorable phrases.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "We've seen exactly what happens when the US gets involved in... regime changes" (implies disastrous outcomes); warnings about torture making America "fearful or vengeful."  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "I'm not sure I've seen any real hard evidence that torturing them has produced any information" (questions torture effectiveness); "I'm wary of media reports."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimization: "I'm hardly worried that [North Korea] will actually attack us" (downplays threat).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "We are not a people that should be... vengeful"; "I don't think torture is what America is about" (appeals to national identity/values).  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "illegal," "torture," "fearful," "vengeful," "lies" (emotionally charged words).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No explicit appeal to popularity. The text *criticizes* popular support ("many Americans are just fine...").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes support for nominees solely to ignorance: "people do not know their Constitution."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct, not deliberately obscure.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Relies heavily on Rand Paul's statements as evidence/support.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – "On what level could torture ever be acceptable?" (implies torture is absolutely unacceptable with no nuance).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "enough is enough" (used to end debate on torture).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – "his administration has quite a bit of turn over too" (irrelevant to Pompeo/Haspel's qualifications).  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting opponents.  

---

**Verdict – 80% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs numerous propaganda techniques (e.g., **Appeal to Fear**, **Loaded Language**, **Flag-Waving**, **Causal Oversimplification**, **Black & White Fallacy**) to persuade readers to oppose Pompeo and Haspel. The author explicitly endorses Rand Paul’s views ("He's right, too"), frames dissent as rooted in ignorance ("people do not know their Constitution"), and dismisses counter-evidence (media reports on torture). While based on real quotes and events, the selective framing, emotional appeals, and one-sided argumentation (ignoring defenses of the nominees beyond Trump’s tweet) reveal a clear persuasive agenda. The inclusion of Trump’s tweet does not balance this, as it is presented without context or rebuttal. The primary goal is to mobilize opposition, not provide objective analysis.
