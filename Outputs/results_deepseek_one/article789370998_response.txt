Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text "The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh":

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "media-savvy sleazeball lawyer" (referring to Michael Avenatti), "materialized out of thin air" (referring to accusers).
2.  **Repetition – No** – No specific phrase or message is repeated insistently throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "Give left-wingers an inch and they’ll take a mile."
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they stand a good chance of taking control from Republicans." (Fears Democratic control and its consequences for the nomination). Also implied in the description of the court being shorthanded and the 4-4 split.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "Suspiciously, Ford can’t –or won’t— say when or where the alleged incident happened and can provide few details." (Directly questions the credibility of Christine Blasey Ford's account).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – "materialized out of thin air" (minimizes the emergence of accusers, implying no substance or legitimacy). "dubious improprieties" and "questionable claims" (minimizes the seriousness of the allegations).
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – While the text discusses politics and the Supreme Court, there is no direct, explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity (like "support our troops" or "for America").
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "Show Trial", "materialized out of thin air", "Suspiciously", "gaming the system", "stalling", "cave", "delaying tactics", "questionable claims", "smear", "media-savvy sleazeball lawyer". (These words/phrases carry strong negative connotations and appeal to emotion/stereotypes).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparison to Nazis or Hitler is made.
10. **Bandwagon – Yes** – "Washington insiders still believe Kavanaugh will be confirmed..." (Appeals to the perceived belief/popularity of an idea among a group presented as knowledgeable).
11. **Causal Oversimplification – No** – While the text blames Democrats for delays, it doesn't attribute a highly complex situation (like the confirmation battle) to a single, simplistic cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text states its points relatively directly, even if biased. No deliberate, confusing vagueness is prominent.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Cites Paul Sperry (New York Post) and Thomas C. Goldstein (Goldstein & Russell, SCOTUSblog co-founder) to support points about Ford's lawyers "gaming the system" and the likelihood of Kavanaugh's confirmation.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Portrays the situation as purely partisan: reasonable Republicans vs. abusive, manipulative Democrats ("Republicans never seem to learn...", "As usual, Republicans’ seeming reasonableness is rewarded with more abuse by the Left.", "Democrats... used the extra time... to produce two new women with questionable claims").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "Republicans never seem to learn from their mistakes." (Shuts down analysis of Republican strategy by framing it as inherent foolishness). "This is a smear, plain and simple." (Kavanaugh's quote, presented approvingly, dismisses the allegations without substantive engagement).
16. **Red herring – Yes** – Introducing Michael Avenatti's representation of Stormy Daniels ("porn star Stormy Daniels") and his new client is largely irrelevant to the specific allegations against Kavanaugh and serves to discredit the new accusation by association with a controversial figure and his past client.
17. **Straw men – No** – The text attacks the Democratic actions and the accusers' credibility as presented. It doesn't clearly refute an argument that wasn't actually made by the opposition.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – While the text attacks Democrats and accusers, it doesn't specifically charge them with hypocrisy by pointing to their own past actions.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on **Loaded Language** ("Show Trial", "sleazeball", "materialized out of thin air", "gaming the system", "smear") and **Name Calling** ("sleazeball lawyer") to frame the narrative negatively against Kavanaugh's accusers and Democrats. It uses **Doubt** and **Exaggeration/Minimization** to undermine the credibility and seriousness of the allegations. The core argument rests on a strong **Black & White Fallacy**, portraying Republicans as reasonable victims and Democrats as inherently abusive and manipulative. **Appeal to Fear** about Democratic control of the Senate and a stalled Supreme Court, **Bandwagon** appeal via "Washington insiders", and **Appeal to Authority** (Sperry, Goldstein) bolster its position. A **Red Herring** (Avenatti/Stormy Daniels) distracts, and **Thought-Terminating Clichés** ("Republicans never seem to learn", "smear plain and simple") shut down critical analysis. While not every technique is present, the pervasive use of these manipulative tactics, combined with a clear, one-sided agenda to discredit the accusations and the opposition while defending Kavanaugh, overwhelmingly indicates this is a piece of propaganda rather than objective reporting or balanced commentary. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the text does report some factual events (scheduling, new accusers, statements) even while framing them propagandistically.
