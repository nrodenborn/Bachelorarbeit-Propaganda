### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Deep State" (used negatively to imply a shadowy, corrupt government), "actual torturer" (direct insult against Haspel).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No significant repetition of phrases beyond quoting Trump’s tweet verbatim (which is reporting, not propagandistic repetition).  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used for persuasion (e.g., "Make America Great Again").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "From Bad To Worse?" (headline implying decline), "it’s about to get a lot worse" (explicit fear of deterioration).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "What are you thinking?" (questioning Trump’s judgment), Pompeo’s "un-American comments" (undermining his credibility).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "CIA might as well start issuing uniforms decorated with skulls and lightning bolts" (hyperbolic imagery to vilify Haspel’s appointment).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Deep State," "criminal activity," "horrific torture," "gruesome torture," "deposed diplomat" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "many of us are concerned" (implying widespread opposition to legitimize criticism).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified causes for complex events (e.g., attributing policy solely to one appointment).  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Language is direct and unambiguous.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Quoting Snowden and Greenwald as authoritative critics (e.g., Snowden’s tweets cited as evidence against Haspel).  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomies (e.g., "only two options").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "end of story" to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All content relates directly to the appointments/criticisms.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Criticisms address actual positions (e.g., Haspel’s role in torture is documented).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No deflection via hypocrisy accusations.

### Verdict – 70% –   
**Explanation:** The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements through **loaded language** ("Deep State," "torturer"), **appeals to fear** ("From Bad To Worse?"), and **doubt-casting** ("What are you thinking?"). It selectively amplifies negative perspectives (e.g., Snowden/Greenwald quotes) while omitting counterarguments, framing Pompeo and Haspel as threats to American values. The **bandwagon** technique ("many of us are concerned") and **appeals to authority** (Snowden as moral arbiter) further manipulate sentiment. However, it includes factual reports (e.g., Trump’s tweet, Tillerson’s statements) and avoids overt lies, reducing its propagandistic intensity. The overarching goal is to delegitimize Trump’s appointments through emotional persuasion rather than balanced analysis, aligning with advocacy journalism or soft propaganda.
