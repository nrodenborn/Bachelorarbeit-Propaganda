Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "deep, deep corruption" (referring to the FBI), "comic opera" (referring to the FBI's investigation), "willful ignorance" (referring to authorities).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated emphasis on the "mystery" of the motive (e.g., "Motive a mystery," "complete mystery," "can’t figure out what could possibly have been Kazi’s motive").  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans; the text relies on narrative arguments.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warns of jihadis advancing into FBI offices and "machete begins to slice through their necks," implying imminent danger to Americans.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions the FBI's credibility: "given the FBI’s recent track record of denial and deception," "The FBI’s bafflement here is part of its deep, deep corruption."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates the FBI's incompetence ("deep, deep corruption," "comic opera") and minimizes alternative explanations (e.g., dismissing mental health investigations as "refusal to acknowledge the 800-pound gorilla").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to patriotism by invoking WWII analogies (e.g., Battle of the Bulge, German invasion of Poland) to frame the incident as part of a war against America.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Uses emotionally charged terms like "jihadis," "Allahu akbar," "global jihad," "800-pound gorilla," "catastrophic," and "islamophobe" (in the author bio) to evoke strong reactions.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – Compares the FBI's investigation to interrogating German soldiers in WWII and the invasion of Poland, linking Kazi’s actions to Nazism.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to the popularity of an idea; focuses on the author’s perspective.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes the incident solely to Islamic terrorism ("probably this has something to do with the global jihad"), ignoring other complexities like mental health or personal motives.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is direct and unambiguous in its claims.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Highlights the author’s credentials: "director of Jihad Watch," "New York Times bestsellers," to lend credibility to his argument.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents only two options: terrorism or mental illness (e.g., "whether the German invasion of Poland... was motivated by Nazism, or by mental health issues"), ignoring other possibilities.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Uses phrases like "global jihad" and "war going on" to shut down debate, framing the issue as self-evident.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introduces irrelevant WWII analogies (e.g., Battle of the Bulge, invasion of Poland) to distract from the specifics of the Kazi case.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents the FBI’s position: claims the FBI denies Islam’s link to terrorism ("The FBI doesn’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad"), though the FBI only stated no "nexus" was found here.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy; focuses on criticizing the FBI’s approach.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs numerous techniques (e.g., Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification) to advance a singular narrative: that the FBI is corrupt and incompetent for not labeling Kazi’s actions as Islamic terrorism. The author dismisses alternative explanations (e.g., mental health) and evidence (e.g., no terrorist "nexus"), instead using hyperbolic language ("deep, deep corruption," "catastrophic"), historical false equivalencies (Nazi comparisons), and fearmongering (e.g., machete attacks on FBI agents). The piece aims to provoke anger and distrust toward the FBI while reinforcing anti-Islam sentiments, as evidenced by the author’s biased framing ("Jihad Watch," "Islamophobe") and omission of counterevidence. While based on a real event, the manipulative techniques and lack of balanced analysis confirm its propagandistic intent. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the core event (Kazi’s attack) is factual, but its presentation is distorted to serve an agenda.
