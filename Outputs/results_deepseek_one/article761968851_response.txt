### Verdict – 95% – Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda**. It employs numerous propaganda techniques to frame Trump’s policies as universally beneficial while vilifying Obama and immigrants. Key indicators include:  
- **Selective Data Use**: Cherry-picks statistics (e.g., black unemployment lows) to credit Trump, ignoring broader economic contexts.  
- **Loaded Language**: Terms like "Obama Regime," "illegal alien surge," and "foreign competitors" demonize opponents and immigrants.  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Appeals to fear (immigrant "displacement"), nationalism ("ADVANTAGE AMERICANS"), and false binaries (Americans vs. immigrants).  
- **Oversimplification**: Attributes complex trends solely to Trump’s policies, dismissing other factors (e.g., "statistical noise").  
- **Bias Amplification**: Uses authoritative sources (e.g., The Economist) selectively to legitimize claims while dismissing counter-evidence.  
The article’s goal is clear: to glorify Trump’s impact and stoke anti-immigrant sentiment, aligning with ideological advocacy rather than objective analysis. Only 5% uncertainty arises from the inclusion of factual data (e.g., Labor Department figures), though these are weaponized to serve the narrative.
