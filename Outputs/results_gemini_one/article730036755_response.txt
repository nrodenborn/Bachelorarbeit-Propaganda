Name calling – No – The text uses factual identifiers for the people involved, such as their names, ages, and roles (e.g., "Westerville officers," "the suspect, 30-year-old Quentin Smith," "a convicted felon"). It does not use insulting labels to attack anyone.

Repetition – Yes – "City of Westerville Police officers Anthony Morelli, 54, and Eric Joering, 39, were fatally shot while responding to a 911 call on Feb. 10, 2018 in Westerville, Ohio." This sentence is repeated verbatim, one after the other.

Slogans – No – The text is a news report and does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.

Appeal to fear – No – While the events described are frightening, the text reports on them factually. It does not use this fear to advocate for a specific idea or against an alternative.

Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or source. It reports the facts as provided by police and 911 records, and clearly states when information is unknown (e.g., "It's unclear at what point Smith was shot").

Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text reports facts and figures from official sources without any apparent attempt to overstate or understate their significance.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make any appeals to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – No – While the text describes emotional events using words like "crying" and "pleading," these are used to factually describe the content of 911 calls and police reports, not to emotionally manipulate the reader toward a specific viewpoint.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does the opposite; it provides a detailed history of previous domestic dispute calls to the home, adding complexity and context to the event rather than simplifying its cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is specific, citing dates, names, and direct information from 911 calls. When information is unavailable, it is explicitly stated as such, which is the opposite of intentional vagueness.

Appeal to authority – No – The text cites authorities (police, city officials, incident reports) as sources of factual information, which is standard journalistic practice. It does not use an authority's opinion as the sole evidence to support a contentious claim.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present the situation as having only two options. It details a complex scenario with a history of domestic issues.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases designed to discourage critical thought.

Red herring – No – The text remains focused on the shooting incident and its relevant background. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract the reader.

Straw men – No – The text is a factual report and does not present or refute any arguments.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse anyone of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 5% – The text is overwhelmingly a factual news report, not a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the public about a specific, tragic event by relaying information from official sources like police reports and 911 calls. It avoids most propaganda techniques, such as loaded language, name-calling, and appeals to emotion, in favor of a descriptive and fact-based tone. The single instance of "Repetition" is very likely a copy-editing error rather than a deliberate persuasive tactic. The text provides context, acknowledges unknown details, and presents a complex situation without pushing a specific agenda, all of which are hallmarks of journalism, not propaganda.
