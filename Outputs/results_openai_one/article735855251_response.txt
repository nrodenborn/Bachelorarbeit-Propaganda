Verdict – 40% – The text contains elements that could be considered propaganda, such as the use of appeal to fear, flag-waving, loaded language, and appeal to authority.

However, the text also provides factual details about the arrests and the legal context, which balances the narrative. Therefore, while there are propaganda elements present, the text is not overwhelmingly propagandistic.
