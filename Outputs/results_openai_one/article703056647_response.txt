### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 80% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda.**

**Explanation:**  
The text employs several classic propaganda techniques, most notably repetition, appeal to fear, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and appeal to authority. The repeated use of alarming terms (“explode”, “deadlier”, “dangerous phase”) and the focus on worst-case scenarios are designed to provoke fear and anxiety in the reader. The text simplifies the causes of the outbreak, focusing heavily on the Famadihana ritual, and backs up its claims with authoritative sources to lend credibility. While it does not use all propaganda techniques, the presence of multiple strong indicators, especially those that manipulate emotion and perception, strongly suggest that the text is intended to influence the reader’s feelings and beliefs rather than simply inform. Thus, there is an 80% likelihood that this text is propaganda.
