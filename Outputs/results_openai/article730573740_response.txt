Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as name calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These elements suggest a significant likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it aims to influence the audience's perception of the Church's adaptation to modernity and the blessing of homosexual couples. However, the text does not employ all possible propaganda techniques, and some arguments are presented with references to authority figures and theological context, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood.
