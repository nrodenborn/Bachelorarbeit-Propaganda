1. Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack individuals, but rather reports on a lawsuit being filed against them.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly brings up Hillary Clinton's case as a point of comparison, emphasizing that she was not prosecuted. Example: "but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton. Hillary is still walking free." and "But Hillary Clinton is running around free, to this day."
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text describes the negative consequences for Saucier but does not use them to instill fear in the audience about an alternative idea.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built around questioning the credibility and fairness of the Obama administration and the justice system. Example: Saucier’s claim that he was subject to "unequal protection of the law" and that his prosecution was "politically motivated".
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text reports Saucier minimizing his actions by saying he only wanted "service mementos," and the final paragraph exaggerates the consequences. Example: "The government actively destroyed his life an made it all but impossible for his family to get back on track."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by consistently identifying Saucier as a "former Navy sailor" who committed his crime on a submarine and wanted "service mementos," framing him as a serviceman wronged by the political system.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's opinion. Example: "lashed out," "scandal," "actively destroyed his life," "burnt about, with good reason."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex legal situation. Example: "They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton,” he continued, alleging his life was ruined for political reasons."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its claims and accusations.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the authority of the President and a news organization to lend credibility to its claims. Example: "A former Navy sailor, who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump..." and "According to Fox News, Saucier argues that..."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a situation with only two outcomes: the unfair prosecution of a regular sailor versus the leniency shown to a political elite. Example: "They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,” Saucier told Fox News... “but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text repeatedly introduces the case of Hillary Clinton to distract from the facts of Saucier's own case, to which he pleaded guilty. The focus is shifted from his crime to an unrelated case to provoke outrage. Example: The entire argument comparing his punishment to the lack of prosecution for Hillary Clinton.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an opponent's argument; it builds its own argument.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects from Saucier's actions by charging the Obama administration with hypocrisy regarding Hillary Clinton. Example: "Saucier argues that the same officials who sought out punishment to Saucier for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server..."

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it is structured as a news report about a lawsuit, its primary function is to persuade the reader of a specific political narrative rather than to inform them objectively. It heavily employs a wide range of propaganda techniques, most notably Whataboutism, by constantly deflecting from the subject's admitted guilt to the case of Hillary Clinton. This is combined with a Red Herring to distract the reader, a Black & White Fallacy to frame the issue as a simple case of elites vs. the common man, and Causal Oversimplification to attribute complex legal matters to a single political motive. The piece is saturated with Loaded Language ("actively destroyed his life") and Exaggeration to create an emotional response of sympathy and anger. The constant repetition of the Clinton comparison, the appeal to the authority of a presidential pardon, and the subtle Flag-Waving by framing Saucier as a wronged patriot all work together to reinforce a single, persuasive, and non-objective viewpoint. The final paragraph is pure editorializing, confirming the text's persuasive intent.
