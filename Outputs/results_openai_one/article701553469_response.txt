No brief, memorable phrases or slogans are used as rallying cries.

**4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation:**  
The opening lines ("First they came for the Jews. And then they came for everyone else.") evoke fear of a broader threat, suggesting that what happens to Jewish students could happen to others.

**5. Doubt – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text questions the fairness and motives of the BDS supporters and the university administration, e.g., "Somehow I don't think being a member of a Muslim student group and supporting BDS would be considered a conflict of interest."

**6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text exaggerates the situation by framing it as "the latest in a long string of antisemitic incidents" and calling the press "toxic" and the movement "racist."

**7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation:**  
There is an appeal to group identity and solidarity, particularly Jewish identity and the right to "Jewish self-determination."

**8. Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation:**  
Words like "mob," "incitement to violence," "toxic campus press," and "absurd attacks" are emotionally charged.

**9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation:**  
There is no direct comparison to Nazis or other universally hated groups.

**10. Bandwagon – No – Explanation:**  
There is no explicit appeal to popularity or suggestion that "everyone" supports this view.

**11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text suggests that the removal of students is solely due to antisemitism, ignoring possible complexities or other factors.

**12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – Explanation:**  
Phrases like "the latest incident...with a rather blatant agenda" and "the double standard here is pretty clear" are vague and do not specify details.

**13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation:**  
Lew's statements and experiences are used as authoritative evidence of antisemitism.

**14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text presents the issue as either supporting Jewish students or being antisemitic, with little room for nuance.

**15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation:**  
Phrases like "This episode is utterly unacceptable" and "the double standard here is pretty clear" are used to shut down further debate.

**16. Red herring – Yes – Explanation:**  
The reference to Igor Sadikov and his "punch a Zionist today" comment distracts from the main issue of the board vote.

**17. Straw men – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text attributes motives to BDS supporters ("to keep their racist boycott movement going by maintaining control over student governments") that may not have been explicitly stated.

**18. Whataboutism – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text says, "And we know exactly what the reaction would be if a student paper refused to publish any pro-Islamist content," shifting focus to a hypothetical double standard.

**Verdict – 95% – The text exhibits a high number of classic propaganda techniques, including name calling, appeal to fear, loaded language, exaggeration, black & white fallacy, and more. The narrative is constructed to evoke strong emotional responses, frame the situation in stark moral terms, and delegitimize the opposing side without nuanced discussion. The use of multiple techniques in concert, the emotionally charged language, and the lack of balance or acknowledgment of complexity strongly indicate that this text is propaganda.**
