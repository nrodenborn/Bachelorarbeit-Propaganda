Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are directly applied to the migrants or caravan beyond the implication of "illegal entry."
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans within the main article text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Describing the caravan as an impending "invasion" met by troops, barbed wire, drones, and night-vision helicopters instills fear about the migrants' arrival. The reinforcement efforts frame the situation as a significant threat requiring a military response.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not explicitly question the credibility of any specific person, group, or idea related to the caravan or border security.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Using the term "invasion" to describe a migrant caravan is a significant exaggeration, implying a hostile, military-style attack rather than a group of people seeking entry.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – The deployment of the Army and Marine Corps, the description of "American forces," and the focus on reinforcing the border against outsiders appeal to patriotism and national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like "invasion," "illegal entry," "blocking," "reinforced," "less penetrable," "thwart," and "sheer numbers" carry strong negative connotations and appeal to emotions (fear, protectiveness) regarding the migrants and the border situation.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt is made to link the migrants or their supporters to groups hated by the audience (e.g., Nazis).
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Popularity or widespread acceptance of the idea of reinforcing the border is not used as an argument.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text doesn't delve deeply into the *causes* of the caravan or the border situation; it focuses on the event and the response.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is relatively straightforward in describing the caravan's movement and the US response. Terms like "invasion" are inflammatory but not vague.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The actions and statements of President Trump ("Trump signed the order," "Trump has described," "Trump told reporters") are presented as authoritative support for the measures being taken and the framing of the situation.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The framing implicitly presents only two options: either reinforce the border militarily against the "invasion" or allow uncontrolled illegal entry. The complexities of migration, asylum law, and humanitarian concerns are ignored.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used that specifically shut down critical discussion within the main article text (though the irrelevant poll might distract).
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The entire poll section ("Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?") is completely irrelevant to the topic of the migrant caravan and border security, serving only to distract the reader and potentially solicit engagement/emails.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent an opposing argument to refute it.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge opponents with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it contains factual elements (the caravan moving, troop deployment numbers, Trump signing the order), these facts are embedded within a highly manipulative framework designed to evoke fear and patriotism. Key indicators include:
*   **Appeal to Fear:** The dominant theme, using "invasion," military imagery (troops, barbed wire, drones, helicopters), and language emphasizing defense ("blocking," "thwart," "less penetrable").
*   **Loaded Language:** Pervasive use of negatively charged terms ("invasion," "illegal entry") to frame the migrants as a threat.
*   **Flag-Waving:** Emphasizing the US military response appeals directly to national identity and the need to protect the homeland.
*   **Exaggeration:** Labeling a migrant group an "invasion" is a severe and deliberate exaggeration.
*   **Black & White Fallacy:** Simplifying a complex humanitarian and legal issue into a binary choice of military defense vs. chaos.
*   **Red Herring:** The irrelevant Acosta poll distracts from the main issue.
*   **Appeal to Authority:** Reliance on Trump's actions and words to validate the perspective.
The overall narrative is constructed not just to inform, but to alarm, rally support for a specific defensive/military response, and portray the migrants as a dangerous, invading force, making its purpose clearly propagandistic. The few factual elements do not outweigh this heavily biased presentation.
