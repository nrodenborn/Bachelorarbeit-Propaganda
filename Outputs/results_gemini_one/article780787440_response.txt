Here are the propaganda techniques and whether they are present in the text:

1.  Name calling – No – The text uses strong descriptive terms like "pedophile priests" and "atrocities," but these are used to accurately describe the nature of the crimes being discussed, not as simple insults to attack an opponent.
2.  Repetition – No – The article covers various aspects of the story and uses different quotes; no single message is repeated excessively in a propagandistic manner.
3.  Slogans – Yes – The text mentions a slogan used by the Church to address the issue. Example: "Francis has promised “zero tolerance” on child abuse"
4.  Appeal to fear – No – The text describes past events and their consequences but does not try to instill fear about alternative ideas or future possibilities.
5.  Doubt – Yes – The article includes quotes that directly question the sincerity and effectiveness of the Church's actions. Example: "But O’Gorman added: ‘(The pope) begs for forgiveness, but still does not admit or own the deliberate policy of cover up designed & implemented by the #Vatican.’”
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The article reports on a past instance where the Pope was accused of minimizing the issue. Example: "...the pope was accused of insensitivity and tone-deafness after insisting, during a visit to Chile, that local abuse survivors had no “proof” against a bishop..."
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The Pope's letter, as quoted in the text, appeals to the collective identity of Catholics to create a sense of shared responsibility. Example: "It is essential that we, as a Church, be able to acknowledge and condemn, with sorrow and shame, the atrocities perpetrated..."
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text quotes phrases that are emotionally charged to convey the severity of the abuse and the pain of the victims. Example: "The heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced."
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – There are no comparisons to Nazis or other universally hated groups in the text.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest any idea is correct or should be followed simply because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does the opposite by quoting an expert who points to a complex "structural problem" rather than a single, simple cause.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article and the quotes within it are direct and clear. It reports on accusations of past cover-ups, but the text itself is not vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article relies on quoting figures of authority and expertise to build its narrative and lend it credibility. Example: "According to church expert John L Allen, an editor at specialized website Crux.com, the Catholic Church has a structural problem..."
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The article presents a nuanced situation with multiple viewpoints from the Pope, an archbishop, a survivor's advocate, and a journalist.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text includes critical analysis from figures like Colm O'Gorman and John L. Allen, which encourages deeper thought rather than shutting it down.
16. Red herring – No – The article remains consistently focused on the topic of child abuse within the Catholic Church and the institutional response.
17. Straw men – No – The article presents direct quotes and criticisms rather than misrepresenting arguments to easily attack them.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing others of hypocrisy; it reports on the events and reactions as they occurred.

Verdict – 15% – The text is a news report from a reputable press agency, and its primary purpose is to inform, not to indoctrinate. It adheres to journalistic principles by presenting multiple perspectives, including those highly critical of the institution at the center of the story (the Catholic Church). While the article contains several propaganda techniques (such as Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority, and Slogans), these are almost entirely found within the statements and quotes of the people being reported on, or are standard journalistic conventions (like citing experts, which is a form of Appeal to Authority). The inclusion of dissenting voices and the reporting of the Church's failures and inconsistencies run directly counter to the aims of propaganda, which typically presents a one-sided, emotionally manipulative argument. Therefore, the text functions as journalism about a topic involving rhetoric, rather than being a piece of propaganda itself.
