### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "racist boycott movement" (labels the BDS movement as inherently racist).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – "If BDS is not anti-Semitic, why..." repeated twice in Lew’s statement.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "First they came for the Jews. And then they came for everyone else" (memorable phrase invoking historical persecution).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "First they came for the Jews..." implies systematic targeting that will expand to others, instilling fear.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "It is unclear whether Sadikov has faced any disciplinary action..." (questions the administration’s credibility).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: Describing the vote as a "mob" action; Minimization: Calling McGill Daily’s funding "automatic student funding" to downplay legitimacy.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "Jewish self-determination" and "Jewish identity" (appeals to Jewish solidarity/identity).  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "harassment," "hate," "blatant agenda," "toxic campus press," "absurd attacks" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No direct comparison to Hitler/Nazis beyond the "First they came..." reference (which alludes to Nazi persecution but does not explicitly link opponents to Hitler).  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No emphasis on the popularity of the pro-Israel position.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes all campus antisemitism to the McGill Daily and BDS movement ("Antisemitism at McGill... nurtured by a toxic campus press").  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are direct, not deliberately obscure.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – No cited authorities or institutions used as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents BDS supporters as universally antisemitic with no nuance (e.g., "inherent anti-Semitism in the BDS movement").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "utterly unacceptable," "inherent anti-Semitism" (shuts down debate by framing issues as self-evident).  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Introduces the hypothetical scenario of a paper refusing "pro-Islamist content" to distract from the core issue.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Claims BDS supporters equate "Zionist" with "Jewish" (e.g., Lew’s "because I am Jewish"), but the text itself conflates opposition to Zionism with antisemitism.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No explicit accusation of hypocrisy against BDS supporters (the Islamist comparison is a red herring, not a direct hypocrisy charge).

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs at least 12 of the 18 techniques analyzed, including loaded language, fear appeals, and oversimplification to frame a one-sided narrative. Key indicators:  
- **Emotional manipulation:** Uses terms like "racist," "mob," and "toxic" to vilify opponents.  
- **Narrative control:** Omits counterarguments (e.g., why BDS is supported) while presenting Jewish students as universal victims.  
- **Selective framing:** Focuses solely on antisemitism as the motive for the board removals, ignoring possible procedural or political conflicts.  
- **Hyperbole:** Inflates incidents (e.g., calling a vote a "mob" action) and ties isolated events to broad, systemic bias.  
While based on real events, the text’s persuasive intent, lack of neutrality, and systematic use of propagandistic devices prioritize emotional persuasion over balanced reporting. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges the underlying factual basis (e.g., board removals), but the presentation is overwhelmingly manipulative.
