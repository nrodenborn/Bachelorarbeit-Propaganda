1. Name calling – Yes – The author describes Senator Ted Cruz’s actions as a "repugnant and outright disrespectful move."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll asking "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times in a row. Additionally, the core idea that Guyger "killed an innocent man" is stated multiple times in slightly different ways to reinforce the point.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the style of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text appeals more to a sense of outrage and injustice rather than instilling fear in the audience about a future threat.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire premise of the article, starting with the headline "Are You Kidding Me, Ted Cruz?", is designed to cast doubt on the senator's judgment and motives.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author accuses Ted Cruz of minimization by framing his call for patience as treating the killing as "simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time—a tragic mistake."
7. Flag-Waving – No – The article does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like "repugnant," "outright disrespectful," "lashed out," "smear campaign," and "horrifically flawed system" to evoke a strong emotional response from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is correct because it is popular; in fact, it argues against what it portrays as a common or systemic viewpoint.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The article simplifies the motivations of law enforcement and Ted Cruz by attributing their actions solely to the idea that they are protecting Guyger "because she is part of the system" and "part of their blue line."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's language is direct and clear, not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – No – While the text quotes political figures, it does not use their status as an authority as the primary evidence for its claims. The argument relies more on emotional and moral reasoning.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The author explicitly frames the situation as a binary choice: "This is a case of right versus wrong, and what Amber Guyger did to Botham Jean was wrong. There is no other way around it".
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to end discussion; instead, it presents a detailed, albeit one-sided, argument.
16. Red herring – Yes – The embedded poll, "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?", is a classic red herring. It is completely irrelevant to the topic of the article and serves to distract the reader and capture their data.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an exaggerated version of Cruz's position. Cruz is quoted as saying "we shouldn’t jump to conclusions," which the author re-frames as Cruz writing the killing off as "simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time—a tragic mistake," an argument that is easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text uses a hypothetical scenario to charge Cruz and the police with hypocrisy: "Would Ted Cruz and police officers be following this same narrative if the roles were reversed? If it was Botham Jean, a black man, walking into the apartment of Amber Guyger, a white female cop, and killing her...?"

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly emotional viewpoint. It achieves this by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques. The article begins with name-calling and casting doubt on its target, Ted Cruz. It is saturated with loaded language ("repugnant," "smear campaign") to provoke outrage. It presents a black & white fallacy, framing the issue as a simple case of "right versus wrong" to dismiss any nuance, such as the legal principle of due process that Cruz was referencing. The author creates a straw man of Cruz's position to make it seem unreasonable and then uses a whataboutism hypothetical to accuse him and the entire police "system" of hypocrisy. This is reinforced by a causal oversimplification that attributes all of their actions to a single biased motive ("because she is part of their blue line"). The inclusion of a completely irrelevant and repetitive poll serves as a literal red herring. An objective news report would present the quotes from both O'Rourke and Cruz and report on the facts of the case without the intense emotional framing, logical fallacies, and persuasive language. This text, by contrast, is constructed to manipulate the reader's emotions and direct their anger toward a specific target.
