### Propaganda Technique Analysis  

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "power-mad ecclesiastical tyrant," "monster" (referring to McCarrick), "neo-Catholic doyenne" (referring to Simcha Fisher), "Dictator Pope."  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated emphasis on Bergoglio's removal (e.g., "Bergoglio must go," "deposition," "the Church cannot abide this pontificate").  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "Bergoglio must go" (memorable phrase used multiple times).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings of "grave threat to the common good of the Church," "apostasy from the truth," and "divine chastisement" if Bergoglio remains.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Bergoglio's credibility (e.g., "Bergoglio’s cunning response," "information of which Bergoglio was clearly already aware").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates Bergoglio's actions as "ecclesial subversion," "worst crisis in [Church] history"; minimizes Fisher’s critique as a "sliver of space for deniability."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to Catholic identity/tradition (e.g., "defend the Deposit of Faith," "lessons of history," "reform-minded cardinals").  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms like "malefactor," "unspeakable crimes," "abuser," "plague of Bergoglio," "wolves."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Hitler/Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Notes "29 bishops" support Viganò and cites Cardinal Eijk to imply growing consensus against Bergoglio.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames all Church crises solely on Bergoglio (e.g., "the only remedies... are his natural death or deposition").  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are polemical but not deliberately obscure (e.g., historical examples are detailed).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites Archbishop Viganò, Cardinal Eijk, canonist Edward Peters, and historical figures (e.g., Cajetan) to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents only two options: depose Bergoglio or face ruin (e.g., "the Church cannot abide this pontificate any longer... One way or another").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Phrases like "Bergoglio must go" and "worst crisis in her history" shut down nuance.  
16. **Red herring** – No – Focus remains on Bergoglio; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents Fisher’s position (e.g., claims she "knows that Francis knows it" despite her stating "I am not saying he is an abuser").  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Does not deflect criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy.  

### Verdict  
**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely propaganda. It systematically employs multiple propaganda techniques (e.g., name-calling, appeal to fear, loaded language) to vilify Pope Francis ("Bergoglio") and demand his deposition. The arguments are emotionally charged, one-sided, and dismissive of counterevidence (e.g., rejecting Fisher’s nuanced critique). Historical and canonical references are weaponized to legitimize extreme conclusions (e.g., deposition), while appeals to authority and bandwagoning create a false sense of urgency. The goal is not balanced analysis but to mobilize sentiment against the Pope, fitting propaganda’s core aim of influencing opinion through manipulative persuasion. The 10% uncertainty stems from the use of factual elements (e.g., Viganò’s testimony), though these are framed to serve the polemical agenda.
