Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. Name calling – **Yes** – "tyrants" (referring to Oregon State Police).  
2. Repetition – **Yes** – "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" repeated three times consecutively.  
3. Slogans – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases beyond standard political language.  
4. Appeal to fear – **No** – No instillation of fear against alternatives.  
5. Doubt – **Yes** – "No doubt, Finicum would have been found not guilty..." questions the credibility of authorities.  
6. Exaggeration/minimization – **Yes** – Minimization: Describing the fire as leaking onto a "small portion" of land downplays the crime.  
7. Flag-Waving – **No** – No explicit appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. Loaded Language – **Yes** – "overzealous appeal," "unjust," "tyrants," "devoted family men" evoke strong emotions.  
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – **No** – No association with universally hated groups.  
10. Bandwagon – **Yes** – "widespread support from their neighbors, local law enforcement, and farmers" implies consensus approval.  
11. Causal Oversimplification – **No** – No oversimplified causes for complex events.  
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – **Yes** – Poll disclaimer: "Completing this poll grants you access..." uses vague language about data usage.  
13. Appeal to authority – **Yes** – Quotes the White House statement and judge's sentencing notes as validation.  
14. Black & white fallacy – **No** – No false dichotomies presented.  
15. Thought-terminating clichés – **Yes** – "This was unjust" ends discussion; "Justice is overdue" discourages scrutiny.  
16. Red herring – **Yes** – The Brett Kavanaugh poll distracts from the Hammond pardon narrative.  
17. Straw men – **No** – No misrepresented arguments refuted.  
18. Whataboutism – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy against opponents.

**Verdict – 65% –**  
The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques (e.g., repetition, minimization, loaded language, bandwagon appeals, and red herrings) to frame the Hammonds' pardon as moral victory while vilifying opponents ("tyrants"). It selectively presents facts (e.g., downplaying the arson, emphasizing community support) and distracts with irrelevant content (Kavanaugh poll). However, it includes verifiable details (sentencing outcomes, civil suit payment), preventing it from being purely propagandistic. The overall slant—portraying the pardon as heroic justice against a corrupt system—aligns with persuasive messaging common in advocacy media, but stops short of wholesale fabrication.
