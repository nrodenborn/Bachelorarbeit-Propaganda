### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – No – The text does not use insulting labels directly against Haspel (e.g., "monster" or "criminal"). It describes her actions factually (though critically) using terms like "torture activities."  
2. **Repetition** – No – Key points (e.g., Haspel’s role in torture) are reiterated but not excessively repeated in a formulaic way.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to simplify the message (e.g., "Stop Haspel!").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text does not invoke fear of alternatives (e.g., "If she’s appointed, terrorists will win"). It focuses on condemning her past actions.  
5. **Doubt** – No – Haspel’s credibility is directly challenged via documented actions (e.g., "centrally involved in the worst abuses"), not through vague insinuations.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Descriptions align with cited sources (e.g., Senate report, *Washington Post*). No hyperbolic terms like "evil" or downplaying like "minor oversight."  
7. **Flag-waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or loyalty (e.g., "Support our country!").  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Uses emotionally charged terms like "worst abuses," "controversial interrogation program," "gruesome torture," and "obstruction" to evoke moral outrage.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Does not claim popular support (e.g., "Everyone opposes her").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Torture program complexities (e.g., political pressure, legal context) are acknowledged via sources like the Senate report.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Language is specific and clear (e.g., "ran a secret prison in Thailand," "destruction of interrogation videotapes").  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites authoritative sources (*Washington Post*, Senate Intelligence Committee, 9/11 Commission chairs) to validate claims, e.g., "the Senate Intelligence Committee’s report... detailed the central role she played."  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Presents Haspel’s actions as morally wrong but does not frame the issue as a false binary (e.g., "You either condemn her or support torture").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "Case closed" to shut down debate; invites scrutiny via evidence.  
16. **Red herring** – No – Stays focused on Haspel’s record; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Does not misrepresent pro-Haspel arguments (e.g., no claim that supporters "endorse torture").  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Does not accuse critics of hypocrisy (e.g., "What about other nominees?").

### Verdict – 40% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **not predominantly propaganda** but exhibits *moderate persuasive intent* through **loaded language** and **appeals to authority**. It relies on documented evidence (e.g., *Washington Post*, Senate reports) to critique Gina Haspel’s involvement in torture and tape destruction, avoiding overt manipulation like exaggeration or emotional fear appeals. However, its selective emphasis on her most controversial actions—while omitting counterpoints (e.g., her career achievements, context of post-9/11 policies)—frames her negatively. This creates a one-sided narrative, but the use of credible sources and factual specifics prevents it from being classified as high-propaganda. The 40% likelihood reflects its factual core paired with implicit bias in framing.
