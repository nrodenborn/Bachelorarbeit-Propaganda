1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the UK government as “enemies of their own people” and refers to Islam as a “Mohammedan cult.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is repeated three times in a row.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the brief and memorable phrase “#FreeTommy Robinson” as a central rallying cry.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by referencing “widespread, organized, paedophile rape of little girls,” “uncontrolled mass migration,” “jihadis who preach murder and death,” and “monstrous crimes committed in the name of Islam.”

5. Doubt – Yes – Gerard Batten’s statement, “Whatever the legal technicalities of his alleged contempt of court, he was imprisoned more for who he is and what he says,” is used to question the credibility and motives of the justice system.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the legal case against Robinson by calling it “legal technicalities,” while exaggerating the threat of Islam by claiming there are “monstrous crimes committed in the name of Islam all over this country every day.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism with the line, “The British are coming back!” which directly invokes a sense of national resurgence and identity.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “tyrannical arrest,” “monstrous crimes,” and “enemies of their own people” to evoke strong feelings of injustice, fear, and betrayal.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text attacks its opponents directly but does not attempt to discredit their ideas by associating them with a separate, hated group like Nazis.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The headline, “#FreeTommy Robinson Rally Draws Tens Of Thousands,” and the mention of a “Fantastic crowd!” appeal to the idea’s popularity to persuade others to join.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests that the complex problems facing the UK have a single, simple cause: the government is “frightened of the Islamists” and is submitting to them.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and inflammatory in its language, not intentionally vague or obscure. Its goal is to make its point clearly, not to confuse the audience with unclear expressions.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text lists the speakers by their official titles, such as “UKIP leader Gerard Batten,” “For Britain leader Anne Marie Waters,” and “Dutch opposition leader Geert Wilders,” to lend credibility to their statements.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options in Gerard Batten’s speech: “You either submit, or you resist,” ignoring any other possible responses or nuances.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The statement that “history will judge him as being on the right side of a struggle between good and evil” is a phrase that discourages critical thought about Robinson’s actions by framing them in a grand, simplistic, and morally absolute narrative.

16. Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of a poll asking, “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is completely irrelevant to the topic of a rally in the UK and serves only to distract the reader.

17. Straw men – Yes – Anne Marie Waters refutes an argument that was not presented when she asks why people are “expected to immediately forget — or ‘not look back in anger’ — about the deliberate, ideology-driven murder of British children.” This misrepresents the call for resilience as a call for apathy, making it easier to attack.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – Anne Marie Waters’ speech repeatedly uses this technique, deflecting from the issue of Robinson’s jailing by asking, for example, “Why is it so easy for our state to jail Tommy Robinson, when it is so difficult to jail a group of men found with an underage girl in a bedroom?”

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly a piece of propaganda. It is not a neutral news report but an article written to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly biased viewpoint. The piece employs a vast majority (16 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques. It systematically uses emotional manipulation (Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language), logical fallacies (Black & White Fallacy, Whataboutism, Straw Men), and identity-based appeals (Flag-Waving, Bandwagon) to construct its argument. The article's framing, the selective quoting of speakers, the inclusion of an irrelevant and distracting poll, and the author's own concluding remarks—which call for a specific religious and political action—all serve to advance a partisan agenda rather than to inform. The sheer density and variety of the techniques used confirm that the text’s primary purpose is persuasion and indoctrination, not objective journalism.
