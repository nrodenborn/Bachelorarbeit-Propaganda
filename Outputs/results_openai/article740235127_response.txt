Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, and appeal to authority.

However, it does not employ some of the more overt or aggressive propaganda techniques, which keeps the likelihood from being higher.
