Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – Examples: "lying propaganda," "Communist teeth," "Clown News Network," "Self Proclaimed 'Fact Checkers'", "drive-by media."  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Examples: "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" repeated 3 times; "you're lying" repeated targeting Colbert, Kimmel, CNN, Acosta, NYT, etc.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable branded phrases (e.g., "Make America Great Again"). "Clown News Network" is name-calling, not a slogan.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Implies media lies threaten truth: *"If they're prepared to lie this shamelessly, what else are they lying about?"*  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Undermines credibility: *"MBFC isn't qualified to comment on the subject,"* *"you can't expect real transparency from... Newsguard."*  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates media deceit (*"total dishonesty," "decades of documented, outright lies"*); minimizes Infowars' actions (*"enhanced, not doctored"*).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism/national identity. Focus is on media bias, not national unity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms: *"lying through their Communist teeth," "smear President Trump," "hypocrisy," "complete fabrication."*  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis. "Communist teeth" is name-calling, not this technique.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on popularity ("everyone believes this"). Focus is on corruption, not trends.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Reduces media criticism to deliberate lies: *"clearest demonstrations of the media's bias... lies and propaganda."* Ignores other factors (e.g., human error).  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Text is direct/accusatory. Accuses *others* of vagueness but doesn’t employ it.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Uses Trump’s validation (*"President Trump backed him up"*) and legal threats (*"I was two days away from filing a lawsuit"*) as proof of credibility.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents media as universally dishonest vs. Infowars/C-SPAN as truthful: *"Every media outlet... you're lying."*  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Shuts down debate: *"Yeah, right!"*, *"I'm sorry Jim, I can't hear you over... your hypocrisy!"*  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Shifts to lawsuits against MBFC and NewsGuard’s biases to distract from the video controversy.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents media’s argument: Media said video was "altered/sped up" (AP); text conflates this with *"doctored to misconstruе reality"* to refute an extreme claim not universally made.  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Deflects criticism by citing CNN’s past errors: *"decades of documented, outright lies and propaganda by CNN."*  

---

**Verdict – 95% – Propaganda**  
*Explanation:* The text overwhelmingly employs propaganda techniques to discredit mainstream media and fact-checkers while promoting Infowars. Key indicators include:  
- **Systematic use of techniques**: 13/18 techniques are present, dominated by *name-calling*, *loaded language*, and *doubt* to vilify opponents.  
- **Us-vs-Them framing**: Creates a binary narrative where media/fact-checkers ("lying," "Communist," "biased") are enemies, while Infowars/Trump allies ("enhanced," "hilarious," "validated") are truth-tellers.  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Uses fear (*"what else are they lying about?"*), ridicule (*"Clown News Network"*), and moral outrage (*"hypocrisy"*) to bypass critical analysis.  
- **Selective evidence**: Cites pro-Trump sources (Ryan Saavedra, PJW) while dismissing all counter-evidence as lies.  
- **Call to action**: Urges readers to "not blindly trust" media and to perpetuate the story (*"use it over and over in article after article"*), aiming to entrench bias.  
The 5% uncertainty allows for the author’s genuine belief in their claims, but the pervasive techniques and intent to delegitimize critics confirm propaganda.
