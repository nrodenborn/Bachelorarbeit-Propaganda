### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 95% – Propaganda**  
*Explanation*: The text overwhelmingly employs propaganda techniques to advance a conspiracy theory about the Las Vegas shooting. It uses **doubt**, **exaggeration**, and **loaded language** to discredit the official narrative, while **causal oversimplification** and **black/white fallacy** frame the event as a "deep state false flag." **Appeal to authority** (e.g., Ambellas, Cardone) and **bandwagon** ("dozens of similar reports") create false credibility, and **obfuscation** ("deep state") obscures lack of evidence. **Repetition** of "multiple shooters" and **red herrings** (airport shooters) manipulate emotion, while **thought-terminating clichés** stifle scrutiny. The text’s goal is not factual reporting but to delegitimize authorities and promote a specific agenda, aligning with propaganda’s core function. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the use of actual audio clips, though these are presented deceptively.*
