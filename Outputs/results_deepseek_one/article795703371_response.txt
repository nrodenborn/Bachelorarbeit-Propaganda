### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "assault on our country" (Trump's tweet), "CRIMINALS" (capitalized in Trump's tweet).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – "onslaught" (repeated 3x in Trump's tweets), "assault" (2x), and the poll question "Will the Democrats try to impeach..." repeated verbatim.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!" (Trump's capitalized tweet).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "assault on our country," "CRIMINAL elements and DRUGS pouring in," threats to send military/close border.  
5. **Doubt** – **No** – No direct questioning of credibility without evidence.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: "assault," "onslaught," "large flow of people INCLUDING MANY CRIMINALS"; Minimization: Author calls USMCA "hardly a deal."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "assault on *our country*," "CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER" (appeals to national security/patriotism).  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "assault," "onslaught," "weak laws," "criminal elements," "DRUGS pouring in" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No Nazi/Vichy comparisons.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – "All Democrats fault for weak laws!" (reduces border issue to one cause).  
12. **Obfuscation** – **Yes** – Author’s unsupported claim: "every single migrant... will commit at least 28 crimes" (vague, unsubstantiated).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Trump uses his presidential authority to validate threats: "I must, as President...".  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Trump implies only two choices: stop the caravan or face "assault"; Author implies Trump must either act or be "empty and hollow."  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "All Democrats fault for weak laws!" (shuts down debate).  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The impeachment poll distracts from the caravan topic.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Author misrepresents Trump’s stance: "if they make it here and Trump does nothing... words are empty" (Trump never suggested inaction).  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No hypocrisy accusations.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:
The text is **highly propagandistic**, combining techniques from both Trump's tweets and the author's framing.  
**Trump's tweets** heavily rely on:  
- **Fear-mongering** ("assault," "CRIMINALS," drugs) and **nationalist appeals** ("our country," military deployment).  
- **Oversimplification** (blaming Democrats exclusively) and **loaded language** ("onslaught").  
- **Repetition** and **sloganeering** ("CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!") to amplify urgency.  

**The author's commentary** employs:  
- **Emotional exaggeration** (unsupported "28 crimes" claim).  
- **Straw man** arguments (implying Trump might do "nothing").  
- **Distraction** (impeachment poll).  

**Propaganda intent is explicit**: Trump seeks to justify extreme actions (military deployment, aid cuts) by dehumanizing migrants as criminals, while the author uses partisan framing to dismiss Trump’s policies. The text avoids nuanced discussion, instead amplifying fear (95% certainty due to overwhelming technique density and intent to manipulate perception).
