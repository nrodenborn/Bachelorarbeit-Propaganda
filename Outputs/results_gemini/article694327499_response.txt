Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – The text attacks its subjects with insulting labels, such as calling Pope Francis a “cunning ecclesiastical politician, constantly plotting and scheming,” and referring to his supporters as the “neo-Catholic establishment” engaged in a “shameful defense of the indefensible.”

2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The text repeats the sarcastic phrase “What the Pope Really Means®” to mock the idea of reinterpreting the Pope’s words, and repeatedly insists that the defenders of *Amoris Laetitia* are making the problem “even worse.”

3.  **Slogans** – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable, and punchy phrases to make a point and dismiss arguments, such as “Here we go again,” and “Give. Me. A. Break.”

4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting the Pope’s actions are leading to a “train wreck at the end of the line” and “ecclesial auto-demolition,” thereby undermining the very foundations of the Church.

5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The entire article is an exercise in casting doubt on the credibility, intelligence, and motives of Drs. Fastiggi and Goldstein, and Pope Francis, for example: “It seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning.”

6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The text exaggerates the situation by describing it as an “unprecedented pontificate” leading to “ecclesial auto-demolition.” It also minimizes the appointment of Cardinal Burke as a mere “sop” to a “minor position.”

7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – The text appeals to the reader’s Catholic identity by positioning the author as one of the “defenders of the authentic Magisterium” and acting for the good of “Holy Mother Church” against those who would harm it.

8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words intended to influence the reader, such as “infamous paragraph,” “outrageous proposition,” “synodal charade,” and “perniciousness.”

9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – The text uses a variation of this technique by associating the opposing view with a group hated by the target audience. It states: “Then again, the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law.”

10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. Instead, it frames its own side as a righteous minority standing up against a misguided establishment.

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text simplifies a complex theological and political situation by attributing it to a single, simple cause: a deliberate and malicious “master plan” by Pope Francis to “subvert the Church.”

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The author accuses the Pope of using this technique (“promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document”) but the author’s own writing is direct, pointed, and clear in its accusations, not vague.

13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The author dismisses the authority of the professors and the Pope, but appeals to other authorities that support their own argument, such as “a standard Latin dictionary,” “John Paul II’s Familiaris consortio,” and a past ecumenical council.

14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between only two options: the author’s side, which defends the “authentic Magisterium,” and the Pope’s side, which is on a “Mercy Train as it barrels toward a train wreck.”

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – The text uses dismissive phrases like “Give. Me. A. Break.” and “Here we go again” to shut down consideration of the opposing argument without engaging it substantively.

16. **Red herring** – Yes – The text introduces the case of Pope Honorius I and the appointment of Cardinal Burke. These topics distract from the core linguistic argument about *Amoris Laetitia* in order to attack the Pope’s character and establish a historical precedent for papal error.

17. **Straw men** – Yes – The author refutes a distorted version of the opponents’ argument, stating they would have people believe “objectively immoral behavior... is no longer simply objectively immoral behavior but rather a gift of self,” which is an uncharitable oversimplification designed to be easily attacked.

18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – The text charges Pope Francis with hypocrisy, which fits the provided definition. It contrasts his public image with his alleged actions: “Bergoglio has never been the humble apostle of mercy depicted in his carefully crafted public relations narrative, but rather a cunning ecclesiastical politician.”

***

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform or foster a reasoned debate, but to persuade the reader to adopt a highly negative view of Pope Francis and his defenders. This is achieved through the dense and systematic use of a wide array of propaganda techniques. The author employs aggressive **Name calling** (“cunning ecclesiastical politician”) and emotionally **Loaded Language** (“outrageous,” “charade”) to create a hostile tone. The argument relies on misrepresenting opposing views as **Straw men** and simplifying complex issues into a malicious plot (**Causal Oversimplification**). It generates a sense of crisis through **Appeal to fear** (warning of a “train wreck”) and presents the conflict as a **Black & white fallacy** between the author’s righteous camp and a destructive one. The near-complete absence of a charitable or nuanced engagement with the opposing viewpoint, combined with the sheer volume of manipulative rhetoric, firmly places this text in the category of propaganda.
