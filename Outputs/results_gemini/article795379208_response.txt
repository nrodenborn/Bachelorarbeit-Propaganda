1. Name calling – Yes – Pompeo uses an insulting label against Iran, calling it “the world’s largest supporter of terrorism.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The text states that Pompeo “reiterated at least three times the ‘importance of the investigation.’”
3. Slogans – Yes – President Trump is quoted as saying, “Here we go again with you’re guilty until proven innocent,” which is a brief and memorable phrase used to frame the situation.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Pompeo supports his position by instilling fear of an alternative, suggesting that punishing Saudi Arabia could harm U.S. security efforts against Iran.
5. Doubt – Yes – President Trump’s statement, “Here we go again with you’re guilty until proven innocent,” is used to question the credibility of the accusations against the Saudi rulers.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The Saudi-floated scenario that blamed the murder on “rogue killers” is an attempt to minimize the likely involvement of the state leadership.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Pompeo appeals to American patriotism and national interest by urging people “to be mindful of the extensive energy, economic and security ties between Riyadh and Washington.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The term “rogue killers” is used to emotionally frame the perpetrators as independent actors, and Pompeo’s description of Iran as the “world’s largest supporter of terrorism” uses emotionally charged language.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – There are no instances in the text where an idea is disapproved of by associating it with a hated group like Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is good because it is popular; in fact, it shows the administration taking a position contrary to what “many in Congress and elsewhere have urged.”
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The scenario floated that blamed the murder on “rogue killers” assumes a simple cause for what was likely a complex, state-sanctioned operation.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – When asked if the Saudis had told him whether Khashoggi was alive or dead, Pompeo responds, “I don’t want to talk about any of the facts. They didn’t want to either,” which is a deliberately vague and evasive answer.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Pompeo uses the Saudi leaders' position as evidence for the credibility of their investigation, stating, “They gave me their word.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Pompeo’s argument frames the choice as one between maintaining the partnership with Saudi Arabia to counter Iran or weakening U.S. security, presenting only two options while ignoring others.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – President Trump’s phrase, “Here we go again with you’re guilty until proven innocent,” is a cliché used to dismiss accusations and discourage further critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – When discussing consequences for Saudi Arabia, Pompeo introduces the irrelevant topic of Iran to distract from the issue at hand and reframe the U.S.-Saudi relationship.
17. Straw men – Yes – Trump’s statement, “Here we go again with you’re guilty until proven innocent,” refutes the idea of a formal legal conviction, whereas critics were calling for political and diplomatic action based on the available evidence, not a court verdict.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain an example of a speaker deflecting criticism by accusing their opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 5% – The text itself is a news article from the Los Angeles Times, a journalistic outlet. Its primary purpose is to report on events and statements, not to persuade the audience to a particular viewpoint through manipulation. The article documents the extensive use of propaganda techniques by the subjects it is reporting on—namely, Secretary of State Pompeo, President Trump, and the Saudi government. It attributes statements, provides context from other sources (Turkish officials, critics), and maintains a neutral, informative tone. The presence of propaganda *within* a text does not make the text *itself* propaganda, especially when its function is to report on those statements for public awareness. The low percentage acknowledges that any journalistic text can have subtle, unintentional biases, but this article is overwhelmingly an example of reporting *on* propaganda, not an act of propaganda itself.
