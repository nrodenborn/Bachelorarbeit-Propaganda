Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses insulting labels like "Leftists" and "Progressives" to attack the opposition. Example: "the latest illegal immigration debate between Leftists and the Administration".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: Repeats the same poll question three times consecutively. Example: "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?"
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No distinct, brief, memorable phrase is used as a slogan within the presented text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Instills fear about government plans involving mass migration and land grabs. Example: "Obama planned to have over a million Muslim refugees brought into the US...", "the federal government grab of millions of acres of land...", "needed housing for the millions they planned to bring in."
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Questions the credibility and transparency of the Obama administration's actions. Example: "we really have no idea whether the children brought here during the Obama reign were intentionally separated from their parents...", "We have only what little information the government told us then... considering the fact that Obama wanted to keep as much of this situation as secret as possible."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggerates the scale of refugee numbers and government actions. Example: "the actual number which always ends up to be more than quadruple their stated number." (Exaggeration of discrepancy). Also minimizes Obama's separation actions while emphasizing Trump's: "When it comes to the separation of children from their families, there is nothing new today that was not being done during the Obama reign." (Minimization by framing Obama's actions as the norm).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: No direct appeal to patriotism or national identity is made in the text.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged language and negative stereotypes. Examples: "crackdown on illegals", "Obama reign", "their idol, Obama", "planned event", "very good actors on the Left", "Feds downplay".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or other universally hated groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: No appeal to the popularity of an idea is present.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Attributes the current immigration situation simplistically to the Jade Helm exercise. Example: "today's policy... seems to be a planned event by the US government going all the way back to the domestic military exercises known as Jade Helm in 2015."
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Explanation: Makes vague and unclear claims about the connection between Jade Helm and current policy without concrete evidence. Example: "What many do not realize is, today's policy... seems to be a planned event by the US government going all the way back to... Jade Helm...", "All of which seems to be a planned event." (Uses "seems to be" and doesn't clarify the nature of the plan or evidence).
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: No authority figure is cited to support claims within the text.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents only two extreme solutions to the immigration issue. Example: "If they were [interested in solving the problem/caring about children], there would be no detention and separation... only an immediate deportation... on the spot." (Ignores other policy options).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: No phrases used that clearly shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is", "that's just common sense").
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: Introduces the largely unrelated topic of Jade Helm and government land acquisition to distract from the core debate about family separation policies. Example: The entire section linking Jade Helm, Walmart takeovers, land grabs, and refugee housing plans distracts from discussing the merits/demerits of the separation policy itself.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: Misrepresents the left's position on family separation as solely accusing Trump of being uniquely cruel and ignoring Obama's actions, implying they are hypocritical Obama idolizers. Example: "What we seem to have here... is some very good actors on the Left accusing the Trump Administration of being cruel and insensitive... When in fact, their idol, Obama did the same thing..." (The "Left's" argument is often about the *scale* and *systematic nature* under Trump, not that separation *never* occurred before. The text refutes this misrepresented argument and adds "idol").
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Explanation: Charges opponents (the Left) with hypocrisy by deflecting criticism of Trump's policy to Obama's past actions. Example: "their idol, Obama did the same thing for years during his time in power." This directly responds to criticism of Trump by pointing to Obama's actions.

**Verdict – 90% –** Explanation: The text exhibits a very high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is not balanced analysis but to advance a specific narrative (defending Trump's policy by attacking Obama and the Left, while promoting a conspiracy theory linking current events to Jade Helm). Key indicators include:
*   **Frequent Use of Multiple Techniques:** It heavily employs Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Obfuscation, Black & White Fallacy, Red Herring, Straw Men, and Whataboutism.
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** Relies heavily on loaded language, fear appeals, and creating doubt to evoke negative feelings towards Obama, the Left, and government actions.
*   **Distortion and Misrepresentation:** Minimizes Obama's role in family separation while emphasizing it under Trump, misrepresents the Left's criticism (Straw Man), and distracts with the speculative Jade Helm connection (Red Herring, Obfuscation, Causal Oversimplification).
*   **Conspiracy Framing:** The core argument hinges on an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory ("planned event") linking Jade Helm, land grabs, and refugee/immigrant housing to current policies.
*   **Lack of Nuance:** Presents complex issues (immigration policy, family separation, refugee resettlement) in overly simplistic, binary, and accusatory terms, dismissing alternative viewpoints or solutions (Black & White Fallacy).
While it contains some factual elements (e.g., Obama admin did detain minors, refugee numbers exist), these are embedded within and distorted by a clear propagandistic framework designed to persuade rather than inform objectively. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of some factual claims, but the overwhelming use of techniques confirms its propagandistic nature.
