Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "RINO extraordinaire" used against Senator Marco Rubio.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrase is used as a central rallying cry or slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "before more people end up dead in Broward County over their corrupt voting practices" instills fear about the consequences of not arresting Snipes.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "but don't worry, a Democrat attorney says that doing so has nothing to do with fraud or corruption" questions the credibility of the attorney's claim/defense.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "crimes against the people of Broward County" exaggerates the nature of the alleged election misconduct into a dramatic crime against the populace.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – The text does not explicitly appeal to patriotism, national identity, or a specific group identity like "We the People".
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Numerous emotionally charged words and phrases: "fiasco", "corrupt voting practices", "illegally destroyed ballots", "botched elections", "blistering criticism", "constitutionally ineligible candidate", "crimes against the people".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis, Hitler, or universally reviled groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to the popularity of the idea that Snipes should be arrested or that fraud occurred.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – While fraud is blamed, the text references multiple specific alleged actions (destroying ballots, missing deadlines, mixing ballots, allowing ineligible voters) rather than attributing the entire situation to one simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and accusatory, not deliberately vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Breitbart as a source ("According to Breitbart"), references an affidavit from Chelsey Smith, and mentions reports from the Sun-Sentinel and Naples Daily News to support claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – "Charges must be made and her arrest should be imminent" presents this as the *only* acceptable outcome, ignoring other possibilities (investigation, due process, innocence).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases used to shut down critical thinking (e.g., "it is what it is", "that's just common sense").
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The inclusion of the poll about Jim Acosta and press passes is irrelevant to the topic of Brenda Snipes' resignation and alleged election fraud.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – "but don't worry, a Democrat attorney says that doing so has nothing to do with fraud or corruption" misrepresents the attorney's likely argument (which was probably about lack of *intent* or *criminal* fraud) as a dismissive "nothing to see here" claim.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not charge an opponent with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions on an unrelated issue.

**Verdict – 75% –** The text exhibits a high degree of propaganda. It heavily employs **Loaded Language** ("fiasco", "corrupt", "crimes against the people", "illegally destroyed") to evoke strong negative emotions. It uses **Name Calling** ("RINO extraordinaire"), **Appeal to Fear** (implying people might die), and **Doubt** (dismissing an attorney's defense) to discredit targets and the idea that fraud didn't occur. It presents a **Black & White Fallacy**, demanding arrest as the only solution. It relies on **Appeal to Authority** (citing partisan sources like Breitbart alongside mainstream ones) and presents unproven allegations as fact ("Snipes allowed illegal aliens, non-citizens and felons to vote"). It includes an irrelevant **Red Herring** (the Acosta poll) and employs **Repetition** within that distraction. While it reports factual events (Snipes' resignation, recount issues, legal violations), the framing, language, selective emphasis, and unsupported leaps (connecting fraud to potential deaths) are designed to provoke outrage, assign absolute blame, and push a specific narrative (Snipes is guilty of major crimes) without presenting a balanced view or conclusive proof of deliberate, criminal fraud. The overall tone and technique usage strongly align with persuasive propaganda rather than objective reporting. The 25% uncertainty acknowledges the underlying factual basis of the recount problems and legal violations.
