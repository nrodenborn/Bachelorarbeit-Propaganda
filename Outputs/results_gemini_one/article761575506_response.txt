Name calling – No – The text reports on an interview and a tweet. No one in the text is attacked with an insulting label.

Repetition – Yes – Bill Clinton is quoted repeating the fact that his apology was public: “I apologized to everybody in the world,” “But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry,” and “The apology was public”.

Slogans – No – The text is a news report and does not contain any brief, memorable phrases intended as slogans.

Appeal to fear – No – The text discusses a past event and a recent interview. It does not attempt to instill fear in the audience.

Doubt – No – While the interviewer's question ("if he had ever apologized privately") implies doubt about the sufficiency of the public apology, the text itself is merely reporting this exchange, not actively casting doubt to persuade the reader.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Bill Clinton minimizes the ongoing relevance of the issue and the need for a private apology by stating his public apology "was enough" and that “I dealt with it 20 years ago plus”.

Flag-Waving – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or national identity in the text.

Loaded Language – No – The text uses neutral, journalistic language to report on the events. The emotional words used ("terrible," "sorrow," "sinned") are direct quotes from Bill Clinton describing his own feelings.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – There are no comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups in the text.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea to validate it.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not attempt to explain a complex event with a single simple cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is written in a clear and direct journalistic style.

Appeal to authority – No – The text does not use an authority's support as evidence for a claim; it reports on the statements of the individuals involved in the event.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present only two options. It discusses the nuance between a public and a private apology.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Bill Clinton’s statement, “I dealt with it 20 years ago plus,” is used to discourage further critical discussion on the topic, suggesting it is old news and no longer relevant.

Red herring – Yes – When asked about fighting impeachment, Clinton introduces an irrelevant point to distract and generate sympathy: “he left the White House $16 million in debt from his defense.”

Straw men – No – The text does not contain any instances of misrepresenting or refuting an argument that was not made.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain any charges of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 10% – The text itself is a piece of journalism, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about a recent interview with Bill Clinton and the reaction to it. It maintains a neutral tone and includes multiple perspectives, such as the interviewer's challenging question and Monica Lewinsky's tweeted response, which provides a counterbalance to Clinton's narrative. However, the text extensively quotes Bill Clinton, who utilizes several propaganda and rhetorical techniques (Minimization, Repetition, Red Herring, Thought-terminating clichés) to frame the narrative in his favor. Because the text is reporting on these techniques rather than using them to push its own agenda, its likelihood of being propaganda is very low.
