Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in "The Cunning CIA" text:

1. **Name calling – Yes**  
   *Explanation:* Repeatedly labels the CIA as "cunning," "brilliant," and "ingenious" in the context of orchestrating assassinations/cover-ups (e.g., "one of the most ingenious and cunning plots ever designed").  

2. **Repetition – Yes**  
   *Explanation:* Uses "cunning," "brilliant," and "ingenious" multiple times to describe the CIA's actions (e.g., "The CIA’s cover-up in the JFK assassination was even more brilliant and ingenious").  

3. **Slogans – Yes**  
   *Explanation:* Repeatedly uses the phrase "national security" in scare quotes to dismiss official justifications (e.g., "on grounds of ‘national security’ of course").  

4. **Appeal to fear – Yes**  
   *Explanation:* Invokes nuclear war as a consequence of investigating JFK's death (e.g., "assassination by the Soviet Union... is obviously an act of war. That means nuclear war").  

5. **Doubt – Yes**  
   *Explanation:* Questions the credibility of CIA officials (e.g., "Helms was a perjurer. A liar... what value does his denial... have?").  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes**  
   *Explanation:* Exaggerates the CIA's omnipotence (e.g., "one of the most ingenious and cunning plots ever designed") and minimizes Oswald’s possible motives (e.g., "Why would a genuine communist want to join [the Marines]?").  

7. **Flag-Waving – Yes**  
   *Explanation:* Appeals to patriotism by framing Oswald’s Marine service as incompatible with communism (e.g., "How often have you ever heard of a U.S. Marine communist?").  

8. **Loaded Language – Yes**  
   *Explanation:* Uses emotionally charged terms like "reign of terror," "fraudulent and bogus autopsy," and "smear" to provoke outrage.  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No**  
   *Explanation:* No comparisons to Nazis or Hitler.  

10. **Bandwagon – Yes**  
    *Explanation:* Asserts consensus about Oswald’s framing (e.g., "The circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly establishes that Oswald was working for U.S. intelligence").  

11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes**  
    *Explanation:* Blames the CIA alone for JFK’s death (e.g., "the CIA’s cunning cover-up of the JFK assassination"). Ignores other factors.  

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes**  
    *Explanation:* Vaguely references "things went dreadfully wrong in Mexico City" without specifics, and cites sealed records as proof of guilt.  

13. **Appeal to authority – Partial**  
    *Explanation:* Cites Jefferson Morley as an "investigative reporter" but dismisses opposing authorities (e.g., Helms, Shapira) as liars or incompetents.  

14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes**  
    *Explanation:* Presents a false dichotomy: either Oswald acted alone (officially) or the CIA orchestrated everything (e.g., "the CIA’s regime-change operation").  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes**  
    *Explanation:* Uses phrases like "no reasonable doubt" and "overwhelmingly establishes" to shut down counterarguments.  

16. **Red herring – Yes**  
    *Explanation:* Distracts with the rifle-hiding question (e.g., "If someone has just assassinated the president... is he really going to take the time to hide the rifle?") to imply a frame-up.  

17. **Straw men – Yes**  
    *Explanation:* Misrepresents critics as flooding the market with "alternative ‘conspiracy theories’ to confound and confuse the public."  

18. **Whataboutism – Yes**  
    *Explanation:* Dismisses Helms’ testimony by citing his perjury about Chile (e.g., "given that Helms was an admitted perjurer... what value does his denial... have?").

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation  
**The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic** due to its systematic use of at least 15/18 identified techniques. It employs:  
- **Emotional manipulation** (fear of nuclear war, loaded language).  
- **Selective evidence** (citing the CIA manual while ignoring contradictory sources).  
- **Conspiracy framing** (attributing all events to a single entity: the CIA).  
- **Character assassination** (labeling officials "liars," "perjurers").  
- **False dilemmas** (CIA vs. lone gunman; no middle ground).  
- **Obfuscation** (using secrecy as proof of guilt).  

The narrative is designed to confirm bias rather than invite critical analysis. Repetition of "cunning," "brilliant," and "cover-up" conditions readers to accept the CIA’s guilt, while dismissing counter-evidence as part of the conspiracy (e.g., sealed records = confirmation). The tone is accusatory and absolute, leaving no room for alternative interpretations. Promotional book references further signal ideological alignment. While it raises historical questions, its methods align with propaganda by substituting balanced inquiry with persuasive, one-sided rhetoric.
