Name calling – Yes – The text attacks the subject (the academic discipline of history) with the insulting label "Diversity dogs".

Repetition – No – The text presents a central argument but does not repeat the same message or phrase multiple times.

Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief, memorable phrase to encapsulate its message.

Appeal to fear – No – The text expresses disapproval and concern but does not explicitly instill fear about the consequences of the described academic trend.

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of modern history teaching by suggesting it has "gone to the Diversity dogs" and is no longer focused on what "really matter[s] to history, and to society".

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes traditional historical topics like 'Liberalism' and 'Capitalism' by calling them "mere historiographical curiosities".

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its point.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical phrases like "gone to the Diversity dogs" and "multiculturalist/Identity Politics program" to evoke a negative emotional response.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest that the ideas it criticizes are popular with hated groups like Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text argues against a trend it portrays as popular within academia, rather than appealing to its popularity.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex evolution of university history curricula to a single cause: the "Rise of Identity Politics," ignoring other potential academic, social, or pedagogical factors.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its criticism, using specific (though potentially cherry-picked) data to make its point.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the "Institute of Public Affairs (IPA)" and "Dr Bella d’Abrera (PhD in History, University of Cambridge,)" as authorities to lend credibility to its claims.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy between traditional history (focused on 'Liberalism', 'Democracy') and modern history (focused on 'Race', 'Gender'), implying one must choose between them and that they are mutually exclusive.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "gone to the Diversity dogs" and the sarcastic concluding sentence function to dismiss the subject without engaging in nuanced discussion, discouraging critical thought about the state of academia.

Red herring – No – The text stays focused on its central argument about history teaching in Australian universities and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an unstated argument by implying that those who teach about race, gender, and identity believe that "political, intellectual, demographic and material factors are" no longer what "really matter to history," which is a misrepresentation of the academic position.

Whataboutism – No – The text makes a direct accusation and does not deflect criticism by pointing out the supposed hypocrisy of an opponent.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint towards modern academic history. It employs a multitude of propaganda techniques to achieve this. The piece opens with inflammatory Name Calling ("Diversity dogs") and Loaded Language to immediately frame the topic emotionally. It relies heavily on an Appeal to Authority (the IPA report and Dr. d'Abrera's PhD) to give its claims a veneer of credibility, but then presents the data using a Black & White Fallacy, pitting "Identity Politics" against "real" history. This is reinforced by a Straw Man argument, which misrepresents the position of academics by suggesting they have abandoned traditional historical factors entirely. The argument also uses Causal Oversimplification by blaming a complex shift in a field of study on the single, demonized cause of "Identity Politics." The sarcastic tone and dismissive phrases ("mere historiographical curiosities") are designed to ridicule the subject and discourage any nuanced consideration, functioning as Thought-terminating Clichés. The sheer density of these techniques, all working in concert to promote a single, biased viewpoint and provoke an emotional response rather than critical thought, makes this a clear example of propaganda.
