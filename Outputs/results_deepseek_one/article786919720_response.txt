Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Desperate Feinstein" (headline), "hypocrisy" (used repeatedly to describe Feinstein), "antics" (to describe her actions).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries (e.g., no equivalent to "BUILD THE WALL").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **No** – No attempt to instill fear about alternatives; focuses on discrediting Feinstein/Kavanaugh allegations.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "somehow claim that he may have committed a crime" (questions Feinstein's credibility), "secret letter" (implies secrecy is suspicious).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Minimizes the allegation as "a more than 30 year old claim" and calls it "ridiculous"; exaggerates Feinstein's actions as "antics."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "the American people to see," "people in her state continue to put her in office" (appeals to national/community identity).  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Desperate," "hypocrisy," "antics," "ridiculous," "last minute gambit," "corrupt DOJ and FBI" (emotionally charged words).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to the popularity of an idea or action.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – No oversimplified cause assigned to a complex issue.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – No deliberately unclear statements; allegations are described concretely.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Republican Sen. Cornyn's tweets and the FBI/White House statements to dismiss the allegation.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Portrays Feinstein as solely hypocritical (ignoring context) and reduces the controversy to "political theater."  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Exactly!" and "political theater" shut down critical analysis of the allegation.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Shifts focus to Rep. Keith Ellison (accused of abuse) and the Vince Foster conspiracy to distract from Kavanaugh's allegation.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Claims Feinstein says Kavanaugh "may have committed a crime," but her statement only references referring the matter to authorities.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Accuses Feinstein of hypocrisy for "remaining silent" on accusations against Rep. Ellison while pursuing Kavanaugh's allegation.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs 11/18 identified techniques, including pervasive **loaded language** ("desperate," "corrupt"), **name-calling**, and **whataboutism** (deflecting to Ellison). It minimizes the Kavanaugh allegation while exaggerating Feinstein's actions, uses **straw men** to misrepresent her position, and deploys **thought-terminating clichés** ("political theater") to dismiss scrutiny. The **repetition** of the poll question and **appeals to authority** (Cornyn, FBI) further manipulate perception. Though it embeds factual reports (e.g., FBI procedures), these are framed to support the propaganda goal: discrediting Feinstein and defending Kavanaugh. The tone, selective emphasis, and logical fallacies confirm a clear intent to influence readers emotionally rather than inform neutrally.
