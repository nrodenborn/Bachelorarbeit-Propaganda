Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "‘civil rights hero’ (TM) Rep. Clyburn" (The use of quotes and TM sarcastically labels Clyburn's status as a "civil rights hero", implying it's undeserved or manufactured).
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: No single specific message or phrase is repeated persistently throughout the text to hammer it home. Mentions of Farrakhan and Democrats are central but not repetitively hammered in a single phrase.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not employ a brief, memorable phrase designed for easy recall and emotional impact like "Build the Wall" or "Make America Great Again".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – Explanation: The text focuses on exposing connections and alleged hypocrisy; it does not primarily attempt to instill fear about the consequences of *not* acting on this information or about the alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: "That fails to explain why he met with him." (This directly questions the credibility of the Obama spokeswoman's statement explaining Obama's denunciation of Farrakhan). Also, "So it likely doesn't represent his views." (Casting doubt on the sincerity of Rep. Davis's condemnation).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – Explanation: While the text presents a specific viewpoint, it doesn't clearly exaggerate the significance of the events (beyond its inherent argument) or minimize opposing facts within the quoted statements.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not appeal to patriotism, national identity, or use phrases like "We the People" to rally support based on group identity beyond the implied "conservative journalists vs. liberal media" framing.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: "infamous Obama-Farrakhan photo", "the media's Farrakhan embargo", "conspiracy theories", "blames everyone else". These phrases carry strong negative connotations and stereotypes, appealing to emotions (outrage, suspicion) rather than neutral description.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not attempt to link the subjects (Democrats, Farrakhan) to Nazis or other universally hated groups to condemn them by association in this manner. (While Farrakhan is controversial, the text doesn't use that specific comparison technique).
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not argue that an idea or action should be accepted simply because it's popular or gaining traction (e.g., "everyone is doing it"). It focuses on exposing actions and alleged cover-ups.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text doesn't attribute complex societal issues or events to a single, simple cause. It focuses on specific connections and responses.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is relatively direct in its accusations and descriptions. It doesn't rely on deliberately unclear or obscure language to confuse the reader about its main points.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: While it cites sources (Daily Caller, Final Call, statements), it doesn't primarily rely on invoking an authority figure's support as the main evidence for its claims. The argument rests on the reported facts and connections themselves.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: The text doesn't explicitly present only two extreme, mutually exclusive options on a broader issue. Its criticism is focused on specific actions (meeting Farrakhan, not condemning him strongly enough).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: The text doesn't use simplistic, clichéd phrases to shut down discussion (e.g., "It is what it is", "America: love it or leave it"). It invites discussion by claiming an "embargo" is breaking.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the topic of Democratic politicians' connections to and responses regarding Farrakhan. It doesn't introduce a significantly distracting, irrelevant topic.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text criticizes the actual statements and actions of the Democrats mentioned (Obama's meeting, Davis's past comments, Clyburn's attendance and non-condemnation). It doesn't significantly misrepresent their positions to make them easier to attack.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Explanation: "We're starting to have that 'national dialogue' about racism that the left keeps wanting us to have." (This implicitly charges "the left" with hypocrisy by suggesting they call for a dialogue on racism but avoid this specific instance involving their own figures and Farrakhan).

**Verdict – 80% – Detailed Explanation:** The text exhibits several clear propaganda techniques, primarily **Loaded Language** ("infamous", "embargo", "conspiracy theories") to frame the narrative negatively and evoke suspicion/outrage, **Doubt** regarding the sincerity of condemnations and explanations from Democrats, and **Whataboutism** implying liberal hypocrisy on discussing racism. The sarcastic **Name calling** ("civil rights hero" (TM)) further undermines the subject. While it reports factual events (attendance at events, statements issued or not issued), the selection of facts, the highly charged framing, the focus on guilt-by-association, and the consistent effort to cast Democrats and the media in a negative light (breaking the "embargo") strongly indicate an intent to persuade and influence the audience against these figures and their party, rather than simply inform. The absence of counter-perspectives or deeper context (e.g., the nature of the events attended, broader political relationships) reinforces this persuasive intent. The presence of multiple techniques and the overall tone make it highly likely (80%) that this is propaganda.
