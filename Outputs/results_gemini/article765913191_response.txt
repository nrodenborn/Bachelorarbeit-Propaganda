1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the mayors as "criminal mayors" and sarcastically as "geniuses."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times in a row. The core message that the proposed laws are unconstitutional and an infringement on rights is also repeated throughout the article in various forms.
3. Slogans – No – The text critiques slogans used by others (e.g., #NeverAgain) but does not use its own brief, memorable phrases to advance its argument.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The headline uses the term "Gun Confiscation Legislation," which instills fear that the government intends to take away all guns. The text also suggests that the proposed policies will leave citizens defenseless by "[siding] with criminals against law-abiding citizens."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text consistently questions the motives and claims of the mayors, for example, "How any of this is consistent with support for the Second Amendment is anyone's guess" and "None of these statements can be backed up by facts."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline's use of "Gun Confiscation Legislation" is an exaggeration of the policies listed, which are primarily bans on specific types of weapons and new regulations, not a general confiscation. The text also minimizes the potential impact of the laws by stating flatly that they will do "nothing to stop criminals."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text repeatedly invokes the Second and Fifth Amendments to the US Constitution, appealing to a sense of patriotism and fundamental American rights to support its position.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and biased words and phrases such as "hypocrisy," "infringe," "criminal mayors," and "unlawful laws" to frame the debate and evoke a negative emotional response.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparison to Hitler or the Nazi party to discredit the mayors' ideas.
10. Bandwagon – No – The article does not suggest its ideas are correct because they are popular. Instead, it frames its argument as being in opposition to a powerful group (the US Conference of Mayors).
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text claims the proposed laws will fail for the simple reason that criminals "won't follow your unconstitutional and unlawful laws in the first place!" This ignores the complex factors involved in crime reduction and the various potential effects of the legislation.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's arguments, while one-sided, are stated directly and clearly. The text is confrontational, not vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author appeals to the authority of the Constitution ("Second Amendment," "Fifth Amendment") and a higher power ("our Creator") as ultimate proof of their position.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the issue as a simple choice between supporting the rights of "law-abiding citizens" and siding with "criminals." It suggests that one either fully accepts the author's interpretation of the Second Amendment or is actively working against it, ignoring any potential for nuance or a middle ground.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The assertion that new laws are pointless because criminals "won't follow your... laws in the first place!" is used as a simple, final-sounding statement intended to shut down any deeper consideration of the laws' potential effects.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll asking "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is an irrelevant distraction from the main topic of the gun control resolutions. It serves to associate the issue with generalized partisan corruption.
17. Straw men – Yes – The headline frames the proposals as "Gun Confiscation Legislation." The author then argues against this extreme idea of widespread confiscation, which is a misrepresentation of the actual policies being discussed (which are specific bans, regulations, and red flag laws).
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text explicitly accuses the opponent of hypocrisy: "Part of the hypocrisy of the US Conference of Mayors is that they actually push to infringe on law-abiding citizens' rights while claiming that it is consistent with the Second Amendment."

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and comprehensive example of propaganda. It foregoes a balanced or objective discussion in favor of a one-sided argument that relies almost exclusively on propaganda techniques to persuade the reader. The article's primary goal is not to inform, but to inflame and solidify an existing viewpoint by appealing to emotion, identity, and fear. It employs name-calling ("criminal mayors"), loaded language ("gun confiscation"), and appeals to fear to create a negative emotional association with the subject. It uses flag-waving (invoking the Constitution) and appeals to a higher authority ("our Creator") to create a sense of righteous, patriotic indignation. Furthermore, it uses logical fallacies like the straw man (misrepresenting the proposals as "confiscation"), red herrings (the irrelevant poll), causal oversimplification, and the black & white fallacy to attack its opponent and shut down critical thought. The sheer number and blatant application of these techniques confirm that the text is designed to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than engage in a reasoned debate.
