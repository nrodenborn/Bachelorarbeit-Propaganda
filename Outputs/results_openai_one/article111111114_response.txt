**Final verdict:**

Verdict – 20% – The text contains some elements of propaganda, such as appeal to fear, loaded language, and appeal to authority, but these are relatively mild and largely serve to provide context or emotional resonance rather than to manipulate or mislead. The majority of the text is factual reporting about a legal case, quoting officials, and describing events. The presence of some emotional language and references to authority figures does not dominate the narrative or distort the facts. Therefore, the likelihood that this text is primarily propaganda is low, at about 20%.
