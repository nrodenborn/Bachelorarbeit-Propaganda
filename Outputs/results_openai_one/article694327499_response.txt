Certainly! Here is the analysis of each propaganda technique as applied to the provided text, with examples and explanations as per your instructions:

---

1. **Name calling** – Yes – The text refers to Pope Francis as “Bergoglio” (his surname, often used pejoratively by critics), calls him a “cunning ecclesiastical politician,” and refers to his supporters as the “neo-Catholic establishment,” implying they are untrustworthy or corrupt.

2. **Repetition** – Yes – The phrase “What the Pope Really Means®” is repeated several times, as is the assertion that the translation issue is a “misunderstanding” or “mistranslation.”

3. **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries in the text.

4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text warns of a “master plan to subvert the Church,” “grave harm,” and a “train wreck at the end of the line,” all designed to instill fear about the consequences of AL and Pope Francis’s actions.

5. **Doubt** – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the credibility of Fastiggi, Goldstein, and Vatican translators, e.g., “how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an ‘offering’ to God?” and “It seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice…”

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The text exaggerates the implications of AL, calling it “perniciousness,” a “master plan to subvert the Church,” and “unprecedented pontificate,” while minimizing the legitimacy of opposing views.

7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – The text appeals to Catholic identity and tradition, e.g., “defenders of the authentic Magisterium,” “the Church’s constant teaching,” and “Holy Mother Church.”

8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like “outrageous proposition,” “nonsense,” “perniciousness,” “cunning ecclesiastical politician,” and “shameful defense of the indefensible” are emotionally charged and meant to provoke strong reactions.

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There is no comparison to Nazis or other universally hated groups.

10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of its position or suggest that “everyone” agrees.

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text suggests that the confusion and harm in the Church are simply due to AL and Pope Francis’s actions, ignoring the complexity of the issues.

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – The text accuses AL and its defenders of “deliberately ambiguous” language and “linguistic tinkering,” and itself uses complex, convoluted arguments that may confuse the reader.

13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text references Joseph Shaw and the Third Council of Constantinople as authoritative sources to support its claims.

14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text presents only two options: either AL is orthodox and harmless, or it is heretical and destructive, with no middle ground.

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Phrases like “No problem here! has been the mantra of the neo-Catholic establishment for nearly half a century” are used to shut down further discussion.

16. **Red herring** – Yes – The discussion of Honorius I and historical councils is introduced to distract from the main issue of AL’s interpretation.

17. **Straw men** – Yes – The text misrepresents the arguments of Fastiggi and Goldstein, e.g., suggesting they believe “objectively immoral behavior… is no longer simply objectively immoral behavior but rather a gift of self,” which oversimplifies and distorts their position.

18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – The text brings up the “neo-Catholic establishment’s” past defenses of “the indefensible” and compares Pope Francis to Honorius I, shifting the focus from the current issue to past or other perceived failures.

### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 95% –**  
The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs a wide range of classic propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, loaded language, straw men, black-and-white fallacies, and more. The language is emotionally charged and designed to provoke outrage, fear, and distrust toward Pope Francis, his supporters, and the official interpretation of Amoris Laetitia. The text exaggerates the stakes, minimizes opposing viewpoints, and uses historical analogies and appeals to authority to bolster its case. It also introduces irrelevant material and distorts the positions of those it opposes. The only techniques not present are slogans, bandwagon, and reduction ad Hitlerum, but the overwhelming use of the other techniques makes the text a clear example of propaganda.
