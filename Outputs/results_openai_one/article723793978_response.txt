Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits some characteristics of propaganda, particularly through the use of appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, and loaded language. These techniques are used to emphasize the severity of the situation in Sweden and to criticize the current state of affairs, particularly in relation to immigration and multiculturalism. However, the text also presents factual information and quotes from public figures, which suggests that it is not purely propagandistic. The likelihood of the text being propaganda is moderate, as it combines elements of factual reporting with techniques that are often used to influence public perception and opinion.
