**Verdict – 15% –** The text is a straightforward news report documenting Democratic candidates’ unified calls for transparency regarding the Mueller report. While politicians naturally use rhetorical techniques (e.g., repetition, slogans, flag-waving), these serve legitimate advocacy for accountability rather than systematic deception. The article neutrally reports statements without sensationalism, distortion, or manipulative framing. The minor propaganda elements (e.g., slogans, appeals to patriotism) reflect standard political speech, not propagandistic intent. Contextually, the emphasis on legal transparency and public accountability aligns with democratic norms, further reducing propagandistic likelihood.
