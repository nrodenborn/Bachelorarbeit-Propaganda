Here is the analysis of the text according to each propaganda technique:

1. Name calling – **Yes** – "WITCH HUNT" (used by Trump and his campaign to label the Mueller investigation).  
2. Repetition – **No** – No single phrase or idea is repeated excessively throughout the text.  
3. Slogans – **Yes** – "WITCH HUNT" (a brief, memorable phrase used consistently by Trump and his campaign).  
4. Appeal to fear – **No** – The text reports Trump's anxiety about the report but does not use fear to push an agenda.  
5. Doubt – **Yes** – "Let’s see whether or not it’s legit" (Trump questions the report's credibility).  
6. Exaggeration/minimization – **No** – The text describes events neutrally without obvious inflation or downplaying.  
7. Flag-Waving – **No** – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. Loaded Language – **Yes** – "WITCH HUNT" (emotionally charged term implying persecution).  
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – **No** – No association with hated groups to discredit ideas.  
10. Bandwagon – **No** – No emphasis on the popularity of an idea to persuade.  
11. Causal Oversimplification – **No** – No oversimplified causes for complex events.  
12. Obfuscation – **No** – The reporting is clear and specific.  
13. Appeal to authority – **No** – No invocation of authority figures as evidence.  
14. Black & white fallacy – **No** – No false dichotomies presented.  
15. Thought-terminating clichés – **No** – No phrases used to shut down critical analysis.  
16. Red herring – **No** – No irrelevant distractions introduced.  
17. Straw men – **No** – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. Whataboutism – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy to deflect criticism.  

**Verdict – 20%** – The text is primarily factual reporting that quotes others using propaganda techniques (e.g., Trump's "WITCH HUNT" slogan and doubt-casting). However, the article itself does not employ these techniques to manipulate. It neutrally documents Trump's actions, quotes multiple sources (opposing counsels, media), and provides context (e.g., Trump's attempt to fire Mueller, ongoing legal issues). The propagandistic elements are attributed to Trump and his campaign, not endorsed by the author. The tone is investigative, not persuasive, and includes balancing details (e.g., Democrats' plans for continued scrutiny). Thus, the text is not propaganda but reports on its use by political actors.
