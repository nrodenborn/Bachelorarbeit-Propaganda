1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses insulting labels, most prominently in the title "Obama’s Treason" and by calling him "the worst President in American history." Other figures are also targeted, such as Wilson being called a "black-hearted Presbyterian bigot."
2. Repetition – Yes – The central accusation of "treason" is repeated multiple times throughout the text, from the title to the concluding paragraphs, reinforcing the main message. For example, "In a sane political environment, Barack Obama would be tried for treason" and "which has committed treason on a scale to rival the treason of Barack Obama?"
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the phrase "That’s Leftist Privilege" near the end. This acts as a brief, memorable slogan to frame the issue in a partisan way.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by linking Obama's actions to future terrorist attacks and nuclear threats. For example, it claims Iran's terror network Hizballah has the "obvious ultimate intention of crossing the border and committing jihad massacres of Americans" and that the deal gave Iran "a green light to manufacture nuclear weapons."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the Obama administration’s public statements, citing a report that the administration acted "despite public assurances the administration was engaged in no such action."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by stating Obama "showered hundreds of billions of dollars on the Islamic Republic of Iran" and calling him "without any doubt, the worst President in American history." It also minimizes the faults of other presidents (e.g., Harding) to make Obama’s alleged actions seem uniquely terrible.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The entire argument is framed as an appeal to patriotism by accusing a former president of "treason" against the United States. It cites U.S. Code 2381 and contrasts Obama's actions with the security and interests of "America."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases designed to evoke a strong negative reaction, such as "treason," "black-hearted... bigot," "jihad massacres," and "Leftist Privilege."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not directly comparing Obama to Hitler, the text introduces Hitler into the discussion when evaluating past presidents, stating that Woodrow Wilson "arguably gave the world Hitler and World War II." This serves to associate the concept of presidential failure with a universally hated figure.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest the reader should agree because the idea is popular. Instead, it frames its position as a difficult truth in an "insane political environment."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a complex geopolitical issue—the Iran Nuclear Deal and the settlement of frozen assets—as a simple act of "treason." It reduces the event to "giving aid and comfort to the enemy" while ignoring the multifaceted diplomatic and legal context.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague phrasing to imply dire but unspecified outcomes. For example: "There is no telling when the worst consequences of Obama’s aid and comfort... will be felt. But they likely will be felt in one way or another."
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites sources like "The Washington Free Beacon," a "congressional investigation," and "Bill Gertz in the Washington Times" to lend credibility to its claims. It also cites "U.S. Code 2381" to give its legal argument an authoritative basis.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a simple binary: either Obama's actions were acceptable or they were treason, with no room for nuanced interpretation of complex foreign policy. The final lines, "Laws? Pah! Laws are for conservatives," also create a stark, false dichotomy.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "That’s Leftist Privilege" is used to dismiss the lack of legal consequences for Obama, discouraging any critical thought about the actual legal standards for treason or prosecutorial discretion.
16. Red herring – Yes – The lengthy section comparing Obama to past presidents (Fillmore, Wilson, Nixon, etc.) is an irrelevant distraction. While it serves to build a narrative of Obama being the "worst," it does not contribute any evidence to the specific legal charge of treason and distracts from the main argument.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text presents a simplified counter-argument: "There are those who say, 'It was their money...'" It then easily refutes this point while ignoring the more complex and substantive arguments in favor of the Iran Nuclear Deal, such as its role in international diplomacy and non-proliferation efforts.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text is on the offensive and does not use this technique to deflect criticism. It attacks Obama and other Democrats but not in response to a charge of hypocrisy against its own side.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt an extreme and hostile viewpoint towards a political figure. It achieves this by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques in a concentrated manner. The piece relies heavily on emotional manipulation through loaded language ("treason," "jihad massacres"), name-calling, and appeals to fear (imminent terrorist attacks and nuclear weapons). It systematically uses logical fallacies, including a central causal oversimplification (reducing the complex Iran deal to simple treason), a black & white fallacy (it's either acceptable or treason), a straw man of the opposing view, and a red herring (the long discussion of other presidents) to distract and build a flawed narrative. The argument is framed by an appeal to patriotism (flag-waving) and reinforced with repetition of the key accusation. While it uses appeals to authority to create a veneer of credibility, its core is a one-sided, emotionally charged argument designed to bypass critical thought and instill a specific, predetermined conclusion in the audience.
