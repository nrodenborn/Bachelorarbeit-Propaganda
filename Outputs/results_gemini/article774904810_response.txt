Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text labels certain officials as “neocon warhawks” and the foreign policy establishment as a “swamp.”
2.  Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is repeated three times in a row. The core idea of a “Gulf of Tonkin incident” is also repeated throughout the text.
3.  Slogans – Yes – The text quotes Colonel Macgregor using the phrase “fake news,” which is a brief and memorable slogan used to dismiss information.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text aims to instill fear of a new war with Iran by referencing the “tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese” who died due to the Vietnam War and the “horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias” in other countries where the US has intervened.
5.  Doubt – Yes – The entire article is premised on casting doubt on the credibility of the U.S. government and the mainstream media, stating the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a “fictitious creation” and that the media “becomes a de facto government employee.”
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration when it describes the Gulf of Tonkin incident as “perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up” and the idea of a beneficial US intervention in Iran as “outright insane.”
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of national identity and history by mentioning the Vietnam War was “tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble” and by referencing the “largest anti-war movement in American history.”
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases such as “flagrant lies,” “neocon warhawks,” “hellbent,” “swamp,” “sabotaged,” and “horrific death tolls” to evoke a strong emotional response from the reader.
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party to discredit an idea.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular; in fact, it frames its perspective as being contrary to the “mainstream media” and the establishment.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies complex geopolitical events by suggesting the Vietnam War escalation was caused solely by the “fictitious creation” of the Gulf of Tonkin incident and that a future war with Iran would be the result of a simple plan documented in the “PNAC report.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not deliberately vague; its arguments and accusations are direct and clearly stated.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on the statements of authority figures to lend credibility to its claims, citing “Army Colonel Douglas Macgregor,” author “Tom Wells,” journalist “Seymour Hersh,” and “General Wesley Clark.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation with Iran as a binary choice between non-intervention and a catastrophic war leading to a “war-ravaged dystopia,” ignoring a spectrum of other diplomatic and political possibilities. The embedded poll about Brett Kavanaugh is a literal example, offering only a “Yes” or “No” answer.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The use of the term “fake news” serves as a cliché to shut down discussion and dismiss information without engaging with it. The phrase “If there was ever a swamp in Washington you are looking at it” is presented as a definitive, discussion-ending statement.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation is entirely unrelated to the article’s topic of a potential war with Iran and serves as an irrelevant distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified version of a pro-intervention argument, stating “the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran is outright insane.” This misrepresents the opposing viewpoint by ignoring more complex arguments related to national security or nuclear non-proliferation, making it easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges opponents with hypocrisy by quoting Tucker Carlson, who notes that neocons focus on Iran while “virtually every attack in America has been inspired not by Iran, but by Iran’s Sunni enemies.” It also points out the hypocrisy of the U.S. training MEK while the group was officially designated a terrorist organization.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it is built around a core of factual information (the misleading nature of the Gulf of Tonkin incident, General Clark's statements about the PNAC memo), it uses this information selectively to construct a one-sided and emotionally manipulative narrative. The primary goal is not to inform in a balanced way, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint: that the U.S. government and media are corrupt entities manufacturing consent for a war with Iran based on a secret, pre-existing plan.

The sheer number of propaganda techniques employed (16 out of 18) is the strongest indicator. The article relies heavily on appeals to fear, casting doubt on official institutions, and using loaded language and name-calling (“neocon warhawks,” “swamp”) to create a clear enemy. It uses appeals to authority (a Colonel, a General) to give its fringe perspective a veneer of credibility, while simultaneously using causal oversimplification to make complex historical events seem like simple, evil conspiracies. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Kavanaugh poll) further detracts from its journalistic integrity. The text is a clear example of how facts can be framed with rhetorical fallacies to create a powerful piece of propaganda.
