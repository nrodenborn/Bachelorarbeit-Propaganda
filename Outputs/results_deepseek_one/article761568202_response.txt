---

**Verdict – 35% –** The text exhibits propagandistic elements through Clinton’s use of **doubt** (questioning the narrative), **minimization** (downplaying his actions as constitutional defense), **flag-waving** (invoking the Constitution), **red herring** (deflecting to Trump), and **whataboutism** (comparing his scandal to Trump’s). These techniques aim to reframe the scandal, deflect criticism, and manipulate perception. However, the text is not predominantly propaganda because it:  
- Includes factual reporting (e.g., Clinton’s quotes, Lewinsky’s essay).  
- Presents multiple perspectives (Clinton’s defense vs. Lewinsky’s critique of power dynamics).  
- Avoids overt emotional manipulation, name-calling, or fearmongering.  
The propagandistic tone is confined to Clinton’s rhetorical strategies rather than permeating the entire text.
