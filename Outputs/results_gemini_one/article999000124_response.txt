Name calling – No – The text reports that an organizer called Nimesh Patel "disrespectful," but this is a factual report of an utterance during the event, not the author of the text using a name-calling technique to attack a subject.

Repetition – No – The text is a short news report and does not repeat any message or phrase to influence the reader.

Slogans – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to promote an idea.

Appeal to fear – No – The text reports on an uncomfortable event but does not attempt to instill fear in the reader about any alternatives.

Doubt – No – The article reports that Patel questioned the organizers' stated reason for stopping his set, but the author of the article does not cast doubt on the credibility of anyone involved.

Exaggeration/minimization – No – The article describes the event using neutral language and does not appear to either exaggerate or minimize the incident.

Flag-Waving – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or national identity in the text.

Loaded Language – No – The text uses neutral, descriptive language (e.g., "uncomfortable territory," "tension in the room increased") to report on the event, not emotionally charged words to manipulate the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text makes no comparisons to hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The article presents a complex situation with multiple factors (the jokes, the audience reaction, the organizers' intervention) rather than assigning a single, simple cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is clear and direct. It states what is known and also clearly states when information is not yet available ("their board is not yet prepared to release a statement").

Appeal to authority – Yes – Nimesh Patel is quoted using this technique to defend himself: “I’m a generation older than all of you I know comedy”.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text presents multiple perspectives and reasons for the events (Patel's jokes, the organizers' claim about tech, Patel's belief he was cut off for the content), not just two opposing options.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text quotes Nimesh Patel saying, "I know comedy," which is used as a phrase to shut down criticism and discourage further discussion about the appropriateness of his jokes.

Red herring – Yes – The text reports that the organizers used a potential red herring by claiming the tech person had to leave early, possibly to distract from the real reason for stopping the show, which was the content of the jokes.

Straw men – No – The text does not feature anyone refuting an argument that was not actually presented. The conflict reported is direct.

Whataboutism – No – No one in the text is accused of hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 5% – The text is a news report, not a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about an event that occurred. It maintains a neutral tone, attributes quotes and actions to the specific people involved, and presents the different sides of the incident. It avoids using loaded language, emotional appeals, or distortion to push a specific agenda. While it does report on individuals *within the story* who used propaganda techniques (Patel's Appeal to Authority, the organizers' potential Red Herring), the article itself is not employing these techniques to persuade the reader. The very low percentage reflects that any text can be interpreted to have a slight bias, but this article strongly adheres to the standards of factual reporting rather than propaganda.
