2. Repetition – Yes – The phrase "mysteriously vanished into thin air" is used in the headline and repeated in the body of the text to reinforce the central idea.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase "mysteriously vanished into thin air" is used as a brief, memorable, and dramatic phrase to encapsulate the article's central claim.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text aims to create suspicion and distrust, but it does not explicitly instill fear in the reader about alternatives to its own viewpoint.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is built on questioning the official narrative, using phrases like "allegedly," "conflicting timelines," and directly questioning Campos's existence: "this leads many to believe that Campos didn’t even exist, to begin with."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The phrase "vanished into thin air" is an exaggeration of someone being out of the public eye. "Cramming lies down our throats" is an exaggeration of authorities presenting a narrative.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make any appeals to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the reader, such as "mysteriously vanished," "fabricated," "cramming lies down our throats," and "desperately want us to believe."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to hated figures like Hitler or the Nazis.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple cause (a conspiracy for "political agendas") for a complex and confusing situation: "fabricated by the very authorities who are cramming lies down our throats about this massacre for the sake of political agendas."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague terms for its antagonists, such as "the authorities," and alludes to "political agendas" without specifying who these authorities are or what the agendas entail, creating a shadowy, undefined enemy.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses a quote from David Hickey, a union spokesman, ("It’s highly unusual") as an authoritative voice to lend credibility to its own suspicious narrative.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents two options: the official narrative, which it frames as a complete lie ("cramming lies down our throats"), and the conspiracy theory it promotes. It ignores other possibilities, such as a chaotic investigation or a witness seeking privacy.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "cramming lies down our throats" is used to dismiss the official narrative entirely, discouraging any critical examination of the authorities' version of events by pre-labeling it as a malicious falsehood.
16. Red herring – No – The article stays focused on the subject of Jesus Campos and the inconsistencies surrounding his story; it does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text creates a simplified and malicious version of the "official narrative," stating "what the media has so far made clear, is that they want the public to believe..." This reframes the complex process of news reporting as a simple, unified effort to deceive, making it easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text accuses authorities of lying and conspiracy, but it does not deflect criticism by charging them with hypocrisy on an unrelated matter.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, conspiratorial viewpoint by distrusting official sources. It achieves this by employing a high density of propaganda techniques. The entire piece is founded on **Doubt**, systematically questioning every aspect of the official story. It uses emotionally charged and **Loaded Language** ("fabricated," "cramming lies down our throats") to create a villain out of the vague "authorities." It offers a **Causal Oversimplification**, attributing all inconsistencies to a malicious plot for "political agendas" rather than the complexities of a real-time crisis investigation. Furthermore, it uses the **Bandwagon** technique ("many to believe") to create a sense of popular support for its theory. The combination of these and many other techniques, all working toward the single goal of promoting a conspiracy and eroding trust in established institutions, moves it far from objective reporting and firmly into the realm of propaganda.
