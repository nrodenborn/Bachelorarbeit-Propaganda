### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Selective framing**: Focuses exclusively on violent incidents (shootings, grenades) and ties them to immigration, ignoring broader context (e.g., Sweden’s low murder rate).  
2. **Emotional manipulation**: Uses fear (Appeal to fear), loaded language (e.g., "multicultural paradise" sarcasm), and exaggeration ("crazy") to evoke panic.  
3. **Oversimplification**: Implies immigration directly causes crime without evidence, ignoring socioeconomic factors.  
4. **Source bias**: "America’s Immigration Voice" is an advocacy group with an agenda against immigration, curating data (e.g., Wikipedia grenade list) to support its narrative.  
5. **Persuasive intent**: Quotes populist rhetoric uncritically while omitting counterarguments, aiming to sway opinion against multicultural policies.  

However, it incorporates factual Reuters reporting (e.g., PM’s statement, election context), preventing a 100% verdict. The propagandistic elements dominate through emotional appeals and oversimplified causality, making the text 85% likely propaganda.
