Based on the definitions provided and the text "India Joins U.S. and China With Plans to Visit the Moon," here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against any object or subject.
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific message or phrase is repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to promote an idea or viewpoint (e.g., "Chandrayaan-2" is the mission name, not a slogan used for persuasion).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear against alternatives to support an idea. It reports on the mission's challenges (like shadow) factually, not fear-inducingly.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of anyone or anything. It presents information about the mission and NASA neutrally.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text reports facts and estimates (like the mission duration, age of rock, delay) without apparent overstatement or understatement for persuasive effect.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – While reporting an Indian achievement, the text does not explicitly appeal to patriotism or national identity to persuade. It neutrally states "India wants..." and "the country's second visit".
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is generally neutral and descriptive (e.g., "shadowy poles," "souvenir rock," "renewed focus"). Terms like "firsts," "dreams," and "tackle" are mild and not heavily emotionally charged or stereotypical in this context.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No idea is disapproved of by linking it to a hated group.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text mentions the US and China also having plans, but this is presented as context ("India Joins U.S. and China...") rather than an appeal to join something because it's popular. The focus is on India's specific mission.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text doesn't attribute complex events to simple causes. It describes the mission's goals, delays (Russia backing out), and challenges (solar power/shadow) without oversimplifying causality.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text provides specific details (target location ~370 miles from pole, 4 billion years old, delay due to Russia, potential 2-week lifespan, solar power limitation) and is generally clear. "Sometime in the first half of this year, no earlier than March" is standard scheduling language, not intentionally vague.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authority (like a leader, scientist, or institution) is cited to lend support to a claim as evidence. Mentions of NASA and President Trump provide context, not authoritative endorsement for a specific argument.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text doesn't present only two options among many. It describes a specific mission plan and context.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used that obviously shut down critical thought or discussion (e.g., "it is what it is," "trust the plan," "everyone knows").
16. **Red herring** – No – All information presented (mission details, history, goals, challenges, context about NASA/Russia) is relevant to the topic of India's lunar mission. There are no obvious irrelevant distractions.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not refute any arguments, let alone misrepresented ones.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge any opponent (like NASA, China, Russia) with hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 20% –** The text is overwhelmingly a straightforward, informative news report about India's planned Chandrayaan-2 moon mission. It details the mission's objectives, history, technical aspects, challenges, and scientific goals in a largely neutral tone. While reporting on a national achievement inherently carries a subtle element of positive framing for the country involved, this falls far short of employing deliberate propaganda techniques to manipulate or persuade the audience towards a specific ideology or course of action. The mention of other nations (US, China, Russia) provides context, not comparative judgment. The 20% acknowledges the inherent potential for national pride in such reporting, but the text itself lacks the manipulative intent or use of the defined techniques characteristic of propaganda.
