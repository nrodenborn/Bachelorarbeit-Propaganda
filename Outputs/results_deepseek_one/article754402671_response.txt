4. **Appeal to fear** – No – Risks (e.g., 50% fatality rate) are stated factually without sensationalism to manipulate emotions.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility; sources (WHO, Health Ministry) are treated as authoritative.

14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Presents nuances (e.g., varying fatality rates, unknown recovery factors); no false dilemmas.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases discouraging critical thought (e.g., "It is not known why..." invites inquiry).

### Verdict – 5% –   
The text is a factual public health report, not propaganda. It cites authoritative sources (WHO, Congo’s Health Ministry) to neutrally inform about Ebola’s risks, origins, and transmission. The appeal to authority (technique #13) is standard journalistic practice for validating facts, not manipulative persuasion. No emotional language, bias, or ideological framing is present. The 5% margin acknowledges that any communication *could* subtly influence perception, but here the intent is educational, not coercive. Content focuses on raising awareness—not advancing an agenda—making propaganda highly unlikely.
