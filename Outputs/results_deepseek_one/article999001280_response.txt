Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "lying through their Communist teeth", "Clown News Network", "drive-by media", "self-proclaimed 'fact checkers'", "lying propaganda".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, brief, memorable phrase is used repeatedly as a slogan within the argumentative text itself. The repeated poll question functions more as repetition.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "If they're prepared to lie this shamelessly, what else are they lying about?" implies a broader, hidden threat of deception beyond the immediate incident.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Notice how quickly... gunned down... with their lying propaganda", "self-proclaimed 'fact checkers'", "MBFC isn't qualified to comment on the subject", "you can't expect real transparency from an outlet like Newsguard", "don't blindly trust self-proclaimed fact-checkers". These consistently cast doubt on the credibility of media and fact-checkers.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "decades of documented, outright lies and propaganda" (exaggerating the scope/severity of CNN's alleged falsehoods), describing the incident as "one of the clearest demonstrations of the media's bias... lies and propaganda" (exaggerating its significance), minimizing the alteration ("enhanced, not doctored").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "lying propaganda", "Communist teeth", "blatant lie", "total dishonesty", "complete disregard", "Clown News Network", "conspiracy to smear", "booming voice of your hypocrisy". These use highly negative, emotional, and prejudicial terms.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Accusing media figures of "lying through their Communist teeth" associates them with a historically despised ideology (Communism) to discredit them.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text does not argue that an idea should be accepted simply because it's popular or that others are doing it.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The text doesn't propose a single, simple cause for a complex societal issue; it focuses on specific accusations of media bias and falsehood.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – While making strong accusations, the text is relatively direct about its claims (e.g., "Jim Acosta, you're lying", "CNN showed the clip but edited out the part...").
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – The text cites Infowars/PJW and Ryan Saavedra, but these are presented as evidence providers or fellow critics, not as unquestionable authorities whose endorsement alone validates the argument. The dismissal of MBFC and NewsGuard is the opposite of an appeal to their authority.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – The poll forces a binary choice ("Yes, he should have gotten it back." vs. "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass.") despite listing "Maybe?" and "I'm not sure" as visible but non-selectable options. It presents the issue as having only two valid sides.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "MBFC isn't qualified to comment on the subject." and dismissals like "you can't expect real transparency from an outlet like Newsguard" shut down consideration of opposing viewpoints.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on attacking the media's handling of the Acosta incident and the credibility of fact-checkers. It doesn't introduce major irrelevant topics.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Accusing the media of labeling the video "doctored" and claiming "that Acosta didn't touch the woman", then refuting *that* ("he clearly touched her"). While some outlets did use "doctored", the core media argument was that the Infowars video was *manipulated* (sped up, freeze-framed) to *misrepresent* the nature of the contact, not that *no contact whatsoever* occurred. The text sets up the weaker argument to knock down.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text directly accuses the media of lying and bias but does not primarily counter criticism by accusing the media of hypocrisy related to other incidents. The hypocrisy accusation ("hypocrisy!") is directed at Acosta/CNN's self-perception vs. reality within *this* incident, not a different one.

**Final Verdict**

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a dense concentration of recognized propaganda techniques: **Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Reduction ad Hitlerum, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating Clichés, and Straw Men.** Its primary purpose is not to provide a balanced analysis of the Acosta incident but to aggressively discredit mainstream media outlets (especially CNN) and fact-checking organizations (Snopes, Politifact, MBFC, NewsGuard) using emotionally charged language, demonizing labels ("Communist," "Clown News Network"), oversimplification, and the dismissal of opposing viewpoints without substantive engagement. The repeated poll reinforces a specific narrative. While it presents specific claims (like the video editing), the framing, tone, and techniques used align strongly with the goal of persuasion through emotional manipulation and delegitimization of critics, hallmarks of propaganda. The lack of counter-evidence or acknowledgment of nuance further supports this classification.
