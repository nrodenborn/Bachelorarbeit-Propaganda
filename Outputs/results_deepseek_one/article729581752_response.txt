Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against any object/subject. The text is descriptive and neutral.
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed for rallying are present. "Grand Solar Minimum" is a scientific term, not a slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text explicitly states "scientists aren’t worried" and later clarifies the event will have "very little effect on the overall global warming trend," countering potential fear.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person, group, or idea. It presents the research findings straightforwardly.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text uses measured language: "around seven percent cooler," "particularly calm moment," "could produce some very noticeable effects," "very little effect." It avoids hyperbole or understatement.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity. The text discusses global phenomena neutrally.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is neutral and scientific. Words like "cooler," "dimmer," "calm," "changes," "effects," "temporary shakeup" are descriptive, not emotionally charged or stereotyping in this context.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There is no association of any idea or group with Nazis or other universally despised entities. The historical Maunder Minimum is referenced factually.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not argue for acceptance based on the popularity of the idea. It relies on scientific data and research.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text acknowledges complexity. It states forecasting specific weather differences "has proven difficult" and explicitly separates the grand minimum's effects from human-caused global warming, avoiding a single, simple cause for complex climate effects.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific: "Grand Solar Minimum," "around seven percent cooler," "mid 1600s," "Maunder Minimum," "very little effect." It defines terms and provides context.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text cites the published study ("Astrophysical Journal Letters") and the research team leader ("physicist Dan Lubin of the University of California, San Diego") to support its claims. *Example: "The study, which was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, was carried out by a team led by physicist Dan Lubin..."*
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents nuanced effects: the Maunder Minimum caused cooling in some regions (Thames freezing) but warming in others (Alaska, Greenland). It also clearly distinguishes the grand minimum's impact from anthropogenic global warming.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – The text presents information to encourage understanding (explaining solar cycles, minima/maxima, potential effects) rather than shutting down critical thought. No dismissive phrases like "it is what it is" are used.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the topic of solar cycles, the predicted grand minimum, its historical precedent, and its potential effects, including the relationship to global warming. No irrelevant distractions are introduced.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that wasn't presented. It presents scientific findings without setting up a weak opposing view.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse any opponent or alternative view of hypocrisy. It focuses solely on explaining the scientific phenomenon.

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is overwhelmingly a straightforward report on scientific research. It clearly cites its source (a published study and its lead author), uses neutral and descriptive language, acknowledges complexity in forecasting effects, and explicitly counters potential misinterpretations by stating the predicted solar minimum will have "very little effect" on human-caused global warming. The single instance of "Appeal to authority" is appropriate and standard for science communication, lending credibility rather than being manipulative. There is no discernible intent to mislead, promote a hidden agenda, or manipulate emotions. The 5% reflects the inherent presence of citing authority in scientific reporting, but this falls well within the bounds of legitimate information dissemination, not propaganda.
