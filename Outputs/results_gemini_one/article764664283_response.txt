Name calling – Yes – The text attacks Garry Wills with an insulting label in the very title: "Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills". It also refers to him and those who agree with him as "Leftist Catholic" in a pejorative sense.

Repetition – Yes – The poll embedded within the article repeats the exact same question three times in a row: "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?"

Slogans – No – The text is a long-form argument and does not employ brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text builds fear around the alternative (Wills' view) by repeatedly linking it to the actions of ISIS and "Qur’an-based Islamic jihad violence," suggesting that accepting Wills' "naïve" interpretation leaves one ignorant of a violent, real-world threat.

Doubt – Yes – The entire purpose of the text is to cast doubt on the credibility of Garry Wills. It explicitly states: "That would be good to know, were Wills a reliable witness. Unfortunately, he proves to be just the opposite."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author accuses Wills of minimization, stating he must "ignore a great deal of Qur’anic incitement and hatred." The author also uses exaggeration by calling Wills' interpretation a "peaceful fantasy Qur’an" and claiming his book "isn’t remotely accurate."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or a national identity. Its focus is on religious and ideological identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged language intended to sway the reader, such as "Foolish," "legerdemain," "incitement and hatred," "peaceful fantasy Qur’an," and "head-in-the-sand posture."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare Wills or his ideas to Nazis or other similarly hated historical groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text argues against what it portrays as an increasingly popular or establishment view, rather than suggesting the reader should join a popular trend.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for the complex phenomenon of Islamic terrorism by arguing it stems directly from the Qur'an, exemplified by the rhetorical question: "if the Islamic holy book is really as peaceful... why do so very many Muslims worldwide misunderstand it?" and then listing ISIS's use of the book as proof.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's arguments and accusations are direct and specific, not intentionally vague or confusing.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The author uses the authority of others as evidence for his interpretation, citing the "prominent Twentieth Century Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri" and a "Muslim politician from Jordan" to counter Wills' claims.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either the Qur'an is a completely peaceful book as Wills supposedly claims (the "fantasy" view), or it is a manual for violence that explains ISIS (the author's view). It does not allow for nuanced interpretations or a middle ground.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down thought; it presents a detailed, albeit one-sided, argument to guide thought in a specific direction.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll asking, "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?", which is completely irrelevant to the main topic of the Qur'an and Garry Wills' book and serves as a distraction.

Straw men – Yes – The author refutes a simplified and uncharitable version of Garry Wills' argument. He reduces Wills' position to claims like the Qur'an saying "Not a thing" about Shari'ah, and then attacks this simplistic assertion rather than engaging with the more complex arguments Wills may have made.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy. It directly attacks its target. It does, however, accuse Wills of using a similar tactic ("tu quoque arguments").

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to engage in a balanced, academic review of Garry Wills' book, but to persuade the reader to reject Wills and his ideas through a variety of rhetorical and manipulative techniques. The text systematically employs a large number of the propaganda techniques listed. It begins with **Name calling** in the title to immediately frame Wills as "Foolish." The core of the article is a sustained effort to create **Doubt** about Wills' credibility as a scholar. It uses **Loaded Language** ("fantasy," "legerdemain," "head-in-the-sand") to create an emotional bias against Wills and his position. The author builds a **Straw man** by reducing Wills' argument to easily refutable points, and presents a **Black & white fallacy** where the only alternative to Wills' "naïve" view is the author's own, which is linked to the violent actions of ISIS. This link is a powerful **Appeal to fear**, which is reinforced by a **Causal Oversimplification** that blames terrorism solely on the text of the Qur'an. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant political poll serves as a blatant **Red herring**. The sheer number and combination of these techniques show a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than inform it, which is the essence of propaganda.
