Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to the subject or opposing views.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core claim about muzzle flashes is stated a few times, but not excessively repeated in a way that fits the definition.
3.  **Slogans** – Weak Yes – "#LasVegasShooting" acts as a brief, memorable phrase associated with the event and the claims made. It serves as a rallying point.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The implication of a covert "air assault" or government/military helicopters firing weapons during a mass shooting is inherently fear-inducing, suggesting a terrifying conspiracy beyond the known shooter. ("air assault," the implication of hidden attackers).
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The text explicitly questions the official narrative by casting doubt on FAA radar data ("no aircraft are visible on the radar in that airspace during that time") and airspace regulations ("helicopters are not allowed to hover..."), implying a cover-up.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes (Exaggeration) – Labeling observed lights as "muzzle flashes" and characterizing their source as an "air assault" or "strategic air assault" is a significant and unproven escalation beyond mere unidentified lights, heavily implying hostile military action.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or national/group identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like "massacre," "air assault," "strategic air assault," "lurk," and "apparent muzzle flashes" carry strong negative connotations and evoke specific, alarming imagery (military attack, hidden danger) without definitive proof.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association of ideas or groups with Hitler or Nazis is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – Weak Yes – While not a strong appeal to popularity, citing Ambellas's appearance on "The Alex Jones Show" (a well-known conspiracy platform) and referencing another YouTube video ("Arch Angel Studios") implies a body of supporting evidence or agreement within a specific community.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text strongly implies that the observed lights *must be* muzzle flashes from helicopters conducting an attack ("appears to confirm," "reveals possible muzzle flashes"), offering this as a simple explanation ("air assault") for the complex Las Vegas shooting event, ignoring more mundane possibilities for lights in the sky.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The claims about the lights, airspace rules, and radar are stated directly, if speculatively. The instructions to view the video are specific.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Shepard Ambellas (founder of Intellihub) and his analysis are cited repeatedly as evidence supporting the claim ("Ambellas pointed out," "A major analysis of this matter was done by Ambellas"). His expertise (especially on this topic) is presented as validating the claim.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Implied Yes – The argument sets up a dichotomy: either the lights are FAA running lights (dismissed as inconsistent) OR they are muzzle flashes from an illegal air assault. This ignores other plausible explanations (e.g., drones, camera artifacts, other legal aircraft lights, reflections).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Weak Yes – Phrases like "Not to mention the fact that..." and the conclusive tone of "appears to confirm" and "reveals possible" can function to shut down critical questioning of the core claim by presenting supporting assertions as settled facts.
16. **Red herring** – No – The discussion stays focused on the lights, the airspace, and the video evidence related to the central claim.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text doesn't misrepresent and refute a different argument; it presents its own claim based on the footage.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are made against opponents of the claim.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits strong characteristics of propaganda. While it presents itself as investigative reporting based on footage, it employs multiple manipulative techniques: **Loaded Language** ("air assault," "muzzle flashes") injects fear and implies a specific, unverified threat. **Exaggeration** elevates unconfirmed lights to evidence of a military-style attack. **Causal Oversimplification** offers this "air assault" as a deceptively simple answer to a complex tragedy. **Appeal to Authority** relies heavily on a single, controversial source (Ambellas/Intellihub) to legitimize the claims. **Doubt** is strategically sown about official data (radar, regulations) to support the conspiracy angle. The **Black & White Fallacy** implicitly frames the situation as "either official story or air assault," dismissing other possibilities. The core claim itself, presented as "revealed" or "confirmed," lacks conclusive evidence and relies on interpretation heavily skewed towards a pre-existing conspiracy narrative, making the overall piece more about promoting a specific, alarming viewpoint than objectively reporting facts. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the *attempt* to reference evidence (videos, regulations), even if the interpretation is propagandistic.
