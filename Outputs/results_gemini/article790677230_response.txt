1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents with insulting terms, such as calling Democrats “desperate” and their tactics “underhanded,” and referring to Michael Avenatti as a “porn star lawyer.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the confirmation process is a politically motivated, illegitimate attack is repeated throughout the text by different sources, using phrases like “underhanded tactics,” “character assassination,” “search and destroy strategy,” “total sham,” “unethical sham,” and “national disgrace.”

3. Slogans – Yes – The text quotes President Trump’s tweet which ends with the brief, memorable, and action-oriented phrase: “The Senate must vote!”

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Senator Lindsey Graham is quoted warning his Republican colleagues, “if you vote no, you're legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics,” instilling fear of the consequences of not confirming Kavanaugh. He also stokes fear of Democrats gaining power by shouting, “Boy, you all want power. God, I hope you never get it.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The text consistently questions Christine Blasey Ford’s credibility, describing her story as “ridiculous” and “implausible,” and pointing out that she “conveniently has no corroborating evidence, no memory of any verifiable facts.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to describe the events, calling Kavanaugh’s testimony an “outstanding performance” and the opposition’s efforts a “search and destroy strategy” and the “most unethical sham.” It also minimizes Ford’s testimony by stating “her ridiculous overall story notwithstanding.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of national and partisan identity by framing the conflict as a defense of a Supreme Court nominee and the integrity of the confirmation process for “the highest court in America” against a “disgraceful” political attack.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to influence the reader, such as “righteous indignation,” “character assassination,” “sordid behavior,” “circus atmosphere,” and “national disgrace.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of the Democrats' actions by associating them with a group/event hated by the target audience, specifically by comparing the hearing to past controversial events: “This is worse than Robert Bork... This is worse than Clarence Thomas.”

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests a shift in popular opinion that the reader should join, stating that commentators on Fox News were “openly musing about the nominee withdrawing, opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later.”

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex reasons for the controversy by attributing it to a single, simple cause: a political plot. For example: “The meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee showed the underhanded tactics employed by the Left against Judge Kavanaugh.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague; its arguments and accusations, while biased, are presented directly and clearly.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on quotes from authorities like President Trump, Senator Graham, and Senator Grassley, presenting their opinions as factual evidence to support its narrative.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between only two options. Senator Graham is quoted saying, “To my Republican colleagues, if you vote no, you're legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics,” framing the vote as a choice between confirming Kavanaugh or validating a “despicable” act.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that discourage critical thought by offering a simple, final-sounding judgment, such as Senator Hatch’s statement, “This is a national disgrace, the way you're being treated.”

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces an irrelevant and distracting element when Senator Hatch attacks “porn star lawyers with facially implausible claims,” a clear reference to Michael Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick, who were not the subject of the hearing being discussed (which featured Christine Blasey Ford).

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a caricature of the Democrats' argument. Senator Graham is quoted as saying, “What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020,” which misrepresents their stated concerns about the nominee's fitness as a purely destructive political goal.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text attacks the Democrats for their alleged actions within the Kavanaugh confirmation process itself, rather than deflecting criticism by accusing them of hypocrisy on an unrelated issue.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. It is not a neutral report but a highly biased persuasive article that systematically employs a wide range of propaganda techniques to promote a specific viewpoint. It uses loaded language, name-calling, and appeals to authority to construct a narrative of heroes (Kavanaugh, Trump, Republicans) and villains (Ford, Democrats, "the Left"). The article simplifies a complex event into a black-and-white struggle, casting doubt on the accuser while portraying the nominee as a victim of a "total sham." By consistently using at least 16 of the 18 listed techniques, the text prioritizes shaping the audience's opinion and emotional response over providing a balanced and factual account of the events.
