1. Name calling – No – The text uses the term "Black Death," which is a historical name for the plague, but it does not apply insulting labels to specific people or groups to attack them.
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the plague will inevitably spread to the UK is repeated multiple times, for instance, "fear that the disease will spread to the United Kingdom has been confirmed as “100 percent likely”" and "I believe that it’s 100 percent likely that plague will arrive in the UK once more".
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable, and dramatic phrases like "ticking time bomb" to describe the situation.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The article is built around creating fear, using phrases like "ticking time bomb that’s waiting to decimate the world" and "plague spreads easily and can kill within 48 hours."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the position of some experts by stating, "A few health experts have warned that there is no threat to the UK, however, some have warned the plague outbreak will certainly spread to the region," which minimizes the reassuring view and juxtaposes it with an alarmist one.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration with claims like "‘It’s 100 % Likely’ It Spreads To The UK" and that the plague is ready to "decimate the world."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text repeatedly focuses on the threat to a specific nation, the UK, to appeal to the patriotic concern and identity of a British audience (e.g., "spread to the United Kingdom," "threat to the UK," "arrive on British soil").
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to evoke a strong reaction, such as "Black Death," "lethal," "crisis," "devastation," and "chilling warning."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to groups like the Nazis or other figures/groups widely hated by the target audience.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text creates the impression of a growing consensus of concern by citing multiple unnamed "experts," "scientists," and "others" who are worried, encouraging the reader to join in the concern.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests the plague's spread is inevitable simply due to "the vast movement of people across the globe," which is a simplified cause for the complex process of a global pandemic.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague sourcing like "Some experts fear" and "Others worry" without always identifying who these experts are, creating an impression of widespread concern without providing specific, verifiable evidence.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites specific figures like "Paul Hunter, a professor of health protection" and "Richard Conroy, the founder of Sick Holiday" to support its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice through the quote, "it’s just a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’," which suggests the plague's arrival is the only possible outcome, ignoring the possibility that it could be prevented entirely.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like "ticking time bomb" and "it’s just a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’" which are clichés used to end discussion and present a conclusion as foregone.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a quote from "Richard Conroy, the founder of Sick Holiday." His expertise is in travel insurance, not epidemiology, making his authority on the spread of disease questionable and a distraction from the opinions of more relevant public health experts.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or invent a counter-argument in order to easily refute it. It largely ignores or minimizes opposing viewpoints rather than attacking a fabricated version of them.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing others of hypocrisy or pointing out other, unrelated wrongdoings.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it reports on a real-world event, its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the reader of a terrifying outcome. It achieves this by heavily employing a wide array of propaganda techniques. The core of the article is a powerful **Appeal to Fear**, which is amplified by constant **Exaggeration** ("100% likely," "decimate the world") and emotionally **Loaded Language** ("Black Death," "chilling warning"). It uses **Repetition** to hammer home the central message of an inevitable UK outbreak, a form of **Flag-Waving** to make the threat feel personal to a specific audience. The argument is supported by **Appeals to Authority** (some of whom are questionable, creating a **Red Herring**) and framed using a **Black & White Fallacy** and **Thought-Terminating Clichés** ("when, not if") to shut down critical thought. The sheer number and combination of these techniques show a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions rather than present a balanced, objective report.
