Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the given text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – The text refers to the plague as the "black death," which is a historical term for bubonic plague, not an insulting label applied to attack a subject.
2.  **Repetition** – No – While words like "plague" and "spread" are used multiple times, this is descriptive repetition inherent to reporting the facts of the outbreak, not a deliberate technique to hammer home a specific message unrelated to the core information.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries or simplified messages (e.g., no equivalent to "Build the Wall").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text repeatedly emphasizes the rapid spread, airborne transmission ("it is airborne"), short incubation time ("some people will die within 24 hours"), high fatality rate without quick treatment, the inability to contain it, and warnings to tourists and neighboring countries. This instills fear about the plague's consequences. Example: "Once exposed, some people will die within 24 hours."
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person, organization, or information. It presents warnings and expert opinions as credible.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – While alarming, the statements about the plague's characteristics (airborne pneumonic form, short incubation, fatality rate without treatment) are presented as factual claims by experts and officials. There's no clear indication these facts are overstated or understated beyond their reporting.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Words and phrases like "fears," "deadly plague," "sounded the alarm," "impossible to contain," "much bigger threat," "alarming warnings," "disease spreads so fast it sort of gets out of control," and "most deadly form" are emotionally charged and evoke strong feelings of danger and urgency. Example: "The deadly plague outbreak...", "He also sounded the alarm to neighboring countries."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons are made to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally despised groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea to persuade the audience. The warnings are based on expert assessment, not popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text describes the factors contributing to the spread (airborne transmission, flights, pneumonic form) but does not attribute the outbreak or its spread to a single, simplistic cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The language is clear and direct, explaining the situation, risks, and characteristics of the disease (e.g., "it is airborne and spread by sneezing and coughing," "short incubation time").
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text relies heavily on quotes and statements from authorities like Dr. Ashok Chopra (professor of microbiology and immunology), Christine South (head of IFRC emergency operations), and the World Health Organization (WHO) to support its claims and warnings. Example: "Dr. Ashok Chopra... told The Sun Online...", "Christine South... said...", "The World Health Organization (WHO) has now issued alarming warnings..."
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text does not present a complex situation as having only two possible choices or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking or discussion (e.g., "it is what it is," "trust the science" without context). The text invites consideration of the risks.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text remains focused on the plague outbreak, its characteristics, spread, risks, and official responses. It does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that wasn't made.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse anyone of hypocrisy by referencing their past actions or positions.

**Verdict – 30% –** The text exhibits some elements common to propaganda, primarily **Appeal to Fear** and **Loaded Language**, which create a sense of urgency and danger, and **Appeal to Authority** to bolster its credibility. However, these techniques are being used within the context of reporting on a genuine public health threat, supported by expert sources and factual details about the disease's transmission, severity, and spread. The core purpose appears to be informational and cautionary rather than primarily manipulative. It reports on official warnings and expert assessments concerning a real outbreak. While the language is alarming, it aligns with the serious nature of the subject matter as described by the cited authorities. Therefore, while it uses techniques *associated* with propaganda, the primary intent seems to be public health warning based on available information, making it more informational than purely propagandistic. The 30% reflects the presence of fear-inducing and emotionally loaded language but acknowledges the underlying factual basis and legitimate purpose.
