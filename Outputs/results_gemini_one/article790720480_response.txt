Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels like “RINO Senator Jeff Flake” (Republican In Name Only) and “self-professed sexual assaulter Cory Booker” to attack political opponents.

Repetition – Yes – The question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea.

Appeal to fear – No – The text primarily appeals to anger and indignation rather than instilling fear in the audience about a potential future.

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the allegations against Kavanaugh by calling them “unsubstantiated allegations” and stating, “Why that investigation is needed is unclear since all the people Dr. Christine Ford named...denied the attack took place”.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the allegations by stating they are “without a shred of evidence,” which dismisses the testimony of the accuser as having no value.

Flag-Waving – No – While the text quotes Senator Flake mentioning "This country is being ripped apart," the author does not use patriotic appeals to make their own points.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like “good riddance,” “Obama regime,” and “has a spine” to influence the reader’s emotions.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its position is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex reasons for the controversy and the call for an investigation by framing it simply as Democrats being upset they “couldn't control things despite eight years under the Obama regime”.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The phrase “Republicans were subjected to far worse” is intentionally vague, not specifying what happened, thus allowing the reader to imagine the worst without the author having to provide evidence.

Appeal to authority – No – The text does not cite any experts or authorities to support its own arguments.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy where Senator Flake is either with his party or siding with the Democrats, ignoring the possibility of a nuanced position. This is also seen in the suggestion that Arizona will either elect someone with a “spine” or another “Flake”.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “good riddance” is used to dismiss Senator Flake without any critical thought about his reasoning or position.

Red herring – Yes – The poll asking “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is inserted into the middle of an article about Brett Kavanaugh and is completely irrelevant to the topic, serving as a distraction and a data-collection tool.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents Senator Flake’s call for “due diligence” by reframing it as a selfish concern for his own “Comfort?”, making his position seem weak and easy to ridicule.

Whataboutism – Yes – In response to Flake’s reasoning, the text retorts, “What about Judge Kavanaugh's comfort...?” This deflects the original point by accusing Flake of hypocrisy for not showing the same concern for Kavanaugh.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it reports on a factual event (the 11-10 committee vote), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader by reinforcing a specific partisan viewpoint and inciting anger towards political opponents. It employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to achieve this, including name-calling, loaded language, whataboutism, and straw man arguments. The tone is not one of objective reporting or even balanced opinion, but of aggressive, one-sided commentary that dismisses opposing views through ridicule and misrepresentation rather than engaging with them logically. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring poll further underscores that the article's goal is persuasion and engagement within a specific ideological bubble, not journalism.
