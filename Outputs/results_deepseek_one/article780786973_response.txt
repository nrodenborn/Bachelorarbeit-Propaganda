Here's the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Trump calls Mueller's team "Disgraced and discredited," "group of Angry Democrat Thugs," and a "gang."
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrases "no Russian Collusion" and "Rigged Witch Hunt" are repeated by Trump to reinforce his message.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: Trump uses the brief, memorable phrase "Rigged Witch Hunt" to label the investigation.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Trump frames the investigation as "looking for trouble," implying Mueller is actively seeking damaging/incriminating information regardless of facts, creating a sense of threat.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Trump attempts to discredit Mueller and his team ("Disgraced and discredited," "Angry Democrat Thugs," "gang") and the investigation itself ("no Russian Collusion," "phony crime").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Trump minimizes the legitimacy of the investigation ("Rigged Witch Hunt," "phony crime") and the reason for the lengthy interview ("looking for trouble"). He also potentially exaggerates the interview duration ("over 30 hours").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: While appealing to his base, Trump's statements don't explicitly invoke patriotism, national identity, or loyalty to the nation as a primary appeal in this text. (The Mueller tweet example in the definitions list *does* use "We the People," which is flag-waving, but that specific phrase isn't in *this* text).
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Terms like "Angry Democrat Thugs," "gang," "Disgraced and discredited," "Rigged Witch Hunt," "phony crime," and "looking for trouble" are emotionally charged and use negative stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: There is no attempt to link Mueller, his team, or the investigation to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally reviled groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: Trump does not argue that his position is correct because it's popular or that others are adopting it in this text.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text reports complex events (investigation, interview) without attributing them to a single, simple cause. Trump's claims ("looking for trouble" because "they know there is no Russian Collusion") are presented as his opinion, not a causal analysis within the article.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Explanation: Trump's statement that Mueller is "looking for trouble" is cryptic and vague, lacking specific details about what "trouble" means or how Mueller is supposedly seeking it.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** (but countered) – Explanation: Trump references his *own* approval for McGahn's testimony as a point of transparency. The text also includes the countering authority of Alberto Gonzales stating White House Counsel must cooperate with federal investigations.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: While Trump portrays the investigation negatively, he doesn't explicitly frame the situation as only having two extreme choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Phrases like "Rigged Witch Hunt," "no Russian Collusion," and "phony crime" are used by Trump to shut down critical examination of the investigation's merits or findings.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: Trump doesn't introduce a significantly irrelevant topic to distract from the core issue of the Mueller investigation in this specific text. His points, while disputing the investigation, remain related to it.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: While Trump disputes the investigation's legitimacy, he doesn't explicitly misrepresent or refute an argument that wasn't made. He attacks the investigation as he perceives it ("witch hunt," "phony").
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: Trump does not accuse his critics of hypocrisy in this specific text by pointing to their past actions or perceived faults.

**Verdict – 15% – Explanation:** While the text *reports* on statements made by President Trump that heavily utilize propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Obfuscation, Thought-terminating clichés), the text itself functions as journalistic reporting. It presents Trump's propagandistic statements, provides context (like the Trump Tower meeting), includes countervailing viewpoints (Gonzales, legal experts), and clarifies factual points (e.g., no specific collusion statute but other applicable crimes). The *subject* of the text (Trump's rhetoric) is propagandistic, but the *text's construction* by the reporter is primarily informative and balanced, aiming to report events and statements rather than persuade the reader towards a specific agenda using these techniques. The low percentage reflects that the propaganda originates from the quoted subject within a journalistic framework.
