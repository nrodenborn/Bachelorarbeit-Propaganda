Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text "What Happens After Islamic Conquest?" for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "barbarians," "savage enemies of the Christian faith," "fiercest of wild beasts" (used to describe the Islamic warriors).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "arm yourself with the truth" (used in the call to pre-order the book).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The vivid description of atrocities ("Men have been butchered like cattle, women abducted, virgins ravished...") and the warning against "mass Muslim migration into Europe and North America" aim to instill fear of Islam and Muslim immigration.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "So much for the much-vaunted Islamic ‘tolerance’ in Europe, the tales of which Islamic scholar Akbar Ahmed is using to fool gullible Westerners today..." (Questions the credibility of narratives about Islamic tolerance and scholar Akbar Ahmed).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – The extremely graphic and dehumanizing language describing the conquest ("fiercest of wild beasts," "butchered like cattle," "ravished," "snatched") likely exaggerates the brutality for effect. Minimization is not strongly present.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While promoting a Christian perspective, there is no direct appeal to patriotism (e.g., "our nation," "American values") or a specific national identity beyond the broad "Christian faith" vs. Islam.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Numerous emotionally charged words and phrases: "inhuman barbarians," "savage enemies," "fiercest of wild beasts," "butchered like cattle," "women abducted," "virgins ravished," "children snatched," "fool gullible Westerners," "soften their resistance."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or other universally despised groups are made in this text.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea as a reason to accept it. It argues based on historical claims and fear, not popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The text describes historical events and their consequences but doesn't explicitly claim a single, simple cause for a complex modern issue like migration based solely on this event.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The language is direct and inflammatory, not deliberately obscure or vague.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text heavily relies on the quote from Byzantine scholar Bessarion as evidence for the brutality of the conquest and the nature of the conquerors.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – It presents the Islamic conquest as solely characterized by extreme barbarity and intolerance, implicitly contrasting it with a Christian civilization. It frames the current debate on tolerance/migration as Westerners being either "fool[ed]" or "arm[ed]... with the truth."
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "arm yourself with the truth" serves this function. It discourages critical examination of the book's claims or the complex history by framing pre-ordering the book as the simple, definitive solution to gaining "truth."
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The repeated, intrusive poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is completely irrelevant to the historical topic of the fall of Constantinople or Islamic conquests. It distracts the reader.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – "So much for the much-vaunted Islamic ‘tolerance’ in Europe..." The text attacks the idea of Islamic "tolerance" in Europe as if its proponents claim it applied universally and without exception, even in the immediate violent aftermath of conquest. This misrepresents the nuanced historical arguments about periods of relative tolerance (like in Al-Andalus) that usually refer to settled societies, not the conquest phase.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not charge a specific opponent with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions or statements. It attacks a narrative and a scholar directly.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a significant number of propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating Clichés, Red Herring, Straw Men) to present a highly selective, emotionally charged, and one-sided historical account. Its primary goal is not balanced historical analysis but to instill fear and distrust of Islam and Muslim immigration ("mass Muslim migration into Europe and North America") by portraying Islamic conquests as inherently barbaric and intolerant. The heavy reliance on graphic, dehumanizing language, the attack on opposing narratives as deceptive ("fool gullible Westerners"), the use of an irrelevant distraction (Kavanaugh poll), and the direct call to action ("arm yourself with the truth" by buying the author's book) are all hallmarks of persuasive propaganda aimed at promoting a specific agenda and discrediting alternative viewpoints. While based on a historical event, the presentation is designed to provoke a strong emotional reaction (fear, outrage) and drive a specific political/cultural perspective regarding contemporary issues.
