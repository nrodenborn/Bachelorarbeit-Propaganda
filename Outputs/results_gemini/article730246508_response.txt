Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – Police Chief Joe Morbitzer says of people creating fake GoFundMe pages and making threats, “there’s a special place in hell for those people.”
Repetition – Yes – The idea that the officers were heroes is repeated by multiple figures: the Police Chief calls them "true American heroes," President Trump calls them "great police officers," and Governor Kasich calls them "The finest among us."
Slogans – Yes – NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill is quoted as saying, "No cop, anywhere, 'signed up' to be murdered."
Appeal to fear – Yes – NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill's statement that officers were "ambushed & killed" and that "Everyone should be as upset about this as America’s law enforcement officers are" aims to instill a sense of alarm and fear about the dangers police face and the societal implications.
Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or source; it primarily reports information from authorities.
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The slain officers are described in superlative terms like "true American heroes" and "The finest among us," which can be seen as exaggerations to heighten emotional impact.
Flag-Waving – Yes – The Westerville Police Chief calls the slain officers "true American heroes," directly appealing to patriotism.
Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like "slaying," "gunned down," "fallen officers," "horrible shooting," and the police chief's wish for a "special place in hell" for harassers.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to hated groups like Nazis.
Bandwagon – Yes – NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill's statement, "Everyone should be as upset about this as America’s law enforcement officers are," is a direct appeal for the audience to join a collective emotional response.
Causal Oversimplification – No – The article attributes the event to the specific actions of named individuals, which is a direct cause, not an oversimplification of a complex societal issue.
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is a direct news report that provides specific details like names, charges, and locations. It is not intentionally vague.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The article extensively quotes authority figures like the Westerville Police Chief, Ohio Governor John Kasich, President Donald Trump, and the NYPD Commissioner to lend weight and perspective to the events.
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the event as a conflict between "true American heroes" and the criminal who killed them. The Police Chief’s condemnation of harassers and the NYPD Commissioner's call for everyone to be upset also create a binary of being with the police (good) or against them (bad).
Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like "This was their calling, and they did it right" and "No cop, anywhere, 'signed up' to be murdered" serve to end discussion and discourage critical thought about the event.
Red herring – Yes – The police chief's lengthy and emotional condemnation of people creating fake GoFundMe pages and making harassing phone calls, while related to the aftermath, distracts from the main subject of the article (the shooting and the arrest of the accomplice) to focus on a different set of antagonists.
Straw men – Yes – The statement "No cop, anywhere, 'signed up' to be murdered" refutes an argument that was never made. No one suggests officers agree to be murdered; the statement is used to counter unstated, nuanced ideas about the accepted risks of policing.
Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain any instances of an individual deflecting criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 85% – The text is presented as a factual news article, and the core details of the crime are reported journalistically. However, the article's framing is heavily shaped by propaganda. The piece does not create propaganda itself, but it extensively and selectively quotes authority figures who are using numerous propaganda techniques. The heavy use of Loaded Language ("slaying," "gunned down"), Flag-Waving ("true American heroes"), and Appeals to Authority (quoting the President, Governor, and Police Chiefs) creates a powerful emotional narrative rather than a neutral report. This narrative is reinforced by a Black & White Fallacy, which pits the heroic officers against the evil perpetrator and even anonymous harassers. The inclusion of techniques like Slogans, Bandwagon, and Thought-Terminating Clichés from quoted officials pushes the article's purpose away from simply informing and towards shaping a specific emotional and ideological response in the reader: one of unified grief, anger, and reverence for the police, while discouraging any nuanced thought. The high number of identified techniques, embedded within the quotes that form the emotional core of the article, makes it highly propagandistic in its effect.
