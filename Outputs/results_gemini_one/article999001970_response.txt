Name calling – Yes – The author uses insulting labels to attack the students and their ideology, for example: "social justice crybullying" and "Columbia snowflakes".

Repetition – No – The text does not repeat a specific message or phrase multiple times to reinforce it.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses a brief, memorable phrase to encapsulate its argument: "Also the Left killed comedy."

Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear of an alternative; its primary emotional appeal is through ridicule and anger, not fear.

Doubt – No – The text does not primarily seek to question the credibility of a person or group, but rather attacks them directly.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the situation with statements like "Also the Left killed comedy. This is what its corpse looks like," and hyperbolically claims a type of joke "is now a hate crime."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the audience, such as "crybullying," "snowflakes," "corpse," "Comrades," and "thought crimes."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of the students' actions by associating them with a hated group, using the term "Comrades" to link them to communism and calling their objections "thought crimes," a term associated with totalitarian regimes.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue with the statement, "Also the Left killed comedy," blaming a single, broad entity for a nuanced cultural shift.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's position is made very clear through direct, albeit loaded, language rather than through deliberate vagueness.

Appeal to authority – No – While it mentions famous comedians, it does so as a point of comparison, not by citing them as an authority supporting the author's specific argument.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy between "real world" comedy and the students' "sensitivity," ignoring any potential nuance or middle ground. It frames the situation as comedy being either alive (the author's preferred version) or dead.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases to discourage critical thought, such as "This is Columbia," used as a dismissive explanation for why the students are out of touch with the "real world."

Red herring – No – The text does not introduce a completely irrelevant topic to distract the reader from the main argument.

Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an argument that was not made by claiming a joke is "now a hate crime." The students called the jokes "inappropriate," "racist," and "homophobic," but the author refutes the more extreme, unstated charge of "hate crime" to make the students' reaction seem more unreasonable.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse the students or organizers of hypocrisy by pointing to other unrelated wrongdoings.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It is not a neutral report of an event but a heavily biased polemic designed to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint. This is evidenced by the high density and blatant use of numerous propaganda techniques within a short article. The author employs Name Calling ("snowflakes," "crybullying"), Loaded Language ("thought crimes," "Comrades"), and Exaggeration ("the Left killed comedy. This is what its corpse looks like") to provoke an emotional reaction of anger and ridicule against the students. It uses Causal Oversimplification ("The Left killed comedy") and the Black & White Fallacy to frame a complex cultural issue as a simple battle. Furthermore, it uses a Straw Man argument (refuting that a joke is a "hate crime") to misrepresent and delegitimize the students' actual complaints. The goal is not to inform but to rally the reader against a perceived political and cultural enemy, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
