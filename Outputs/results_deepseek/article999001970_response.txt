### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Technique Use**: 15/18 propaganda techniques are deployed, dominated by *name-calling*, *loaded language*, and *false dichotomies* to vilify Columbia students and valorize Patel.  
2. **One-Sided Narrative**: Selectively omits student perspectives (e.g., only quotes Jao superficially) while framing Patel as a free-speech martyr. Emotional rhetoric ("corpse of comedy," "snowflakes") overshadows factual reporting.  
3. **Ideological Agenda**: Explicitly blames "the Left" for societal decay, using the incident to push a broader narrative about "cancel culture" eroding free expression. Comparisons to Pryor/Rock and "thought crimes" hyperbolize consequences.  
4. **Persuasive Distortion**: Facts (e.g., Patel’s mic being cut) are weaponized via *exaggeration* ("killed comedy") and *straw men* (reducing student objections to hypersensitivity). The headline’s scare quotes ("Offensive Jokes") signal bias.  
5. **Intent to Inflame**: Loaded terms ("crybullying," "Comrades") target cultural divides, appealing to readers’ resentment toward "wokeness." The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the event’s real occurrence, but the framing is overwhelmingly manipulative.  

**Conclusion**: The text meets propaganda criteria by distorting an event into a culture-war polemic, using pervasive techniques to provoke outrage and align readers against perceived "social justice" excesses.
