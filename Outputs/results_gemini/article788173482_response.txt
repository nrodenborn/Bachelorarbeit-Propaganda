1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents as “Deep State Plotters,” “nameless, faceless bureaucrats,” “frauds,” and refers to ex-FBI employees as “disgraced.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the Russia investigation is a “hoax” is repeated multiple times, both in quotes from the president and in the author's own narrative.

3. Slogans – Yes – The term “Deep State” is used as a slogan to represent a shadowy enemy. The phrase “witch hunt,” quoted from Trump, also functions as a slogan.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text attempts to create fear of a secret group of “nameless, faceless bureaucrats of the Deep State who hide behind anonymity to undermine the duly elected 45th president,” and warns of a “shameful un-American plot to rig the 2016 election.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to cast doubt on the credibility of the FBI, the Russia investigation, and Democratic lawmakers, for example, stating, “The authors of the letter even lie about the nature of the broad-based request.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by calling the declassification one of the “crowning achievements” of the presidency and the Russia probe “one of the great scandals in the history of our country.” It minimizes by describing Carter Page as someone “who nobody even knew.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by describing Trump’s actions as a “great service to the country” and by labeling the alleged actions of his opponents as a “shameful un-American plot.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like “plotters,” “collusion conspiracy theory,” “hoax,” “corrupt,” “disgraced,” “brazen abuse of power,” and “leftist dirt” to influence the reader's emotions.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of the opposition by associating it with a group hated by the intended audience, namely “the Left,” as seen in phrases like “colluded with the Left” and “so much leftist dirt to uncover.”

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular. Instead, it frames the issue as a struggle of the president and his supporters against a powerful, entrenched establishment.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents the complex, multi-year Russia investigation as having a single, simple cause: it was a “hoax” and an “un-American plot to rig the 2016 election and undermine his successor.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague terms like “Deep State” and “nameless, faceless bureaucrats” without specific definition. The statement that “former President Obama was involved on some level” is also deliberately vague.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the authority of President Trump and House Committee Chairman Devin Nunes to support its claims, quoting them extensively to lend credibility to its narrative.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice: either you support the president’s declassification to expose a corrupt plot, or you are siding with the “Deep State Plotters” who are trying to “undermine the duly elected 45th president.”

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “Make the documents public and let the chips fall where they may” is used to shut down nuanced discussion about the potential risks of declassifying sensitive information.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the irrelevant detail of an “extramarital affair” between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page to discredit them and, by association, the entire investigation they were a part of.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that opponents are not making. It characterizes the Democrats' opposition to declassification as an attempt to hide the fact they will be “exposed as frauds,” misrepresenting their stated argument about preventing a “brazen abuse of power” and protecting an ongoing investigation.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects from the investigation into the Trump campaign by bringing up the actions of his political opponent: “Apparently, he [Strzok] was referring to the salacious, unverified dossier Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid rent-a-spy Christopher Steele to compile.”

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint by employing a comprehensive array of propaganda techniques. The piece systematically uses name-calling (“Deep State Plotters”), loaded language (“shameful un-American plot”), and appeals to fear and patriotism to create a strong emotional bias against the subjects of the Russia investigation and in favor of the president. It relies heavily on causal oversimplification, reducing a complex legal and intelligence matter to a simple “hoax.” The narrative is framed as a black-and-white struggle between a heroic president and a corrupt, vague entity (“the Deep State”), a classic propaganda tactic. The overwhelming presence of 17 out of the 18 listed techniques demonstrates that the article is constructed to manipulate opinion rather than engage in factual, objective reporting.
