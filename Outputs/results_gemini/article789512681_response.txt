Here is the analysis of the text based on the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling – Yes –** The text uses numerous insulting labels to attack Keith Ellison, such as “Cop Killer Supporter” in the headline, “the epitome of an effeminate man,” and refers to his former name “Hakim Muhammad” in a derogatory final sentence.
2.  **Repetition – Yes –** The poll question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is repeated three times in a row. Additionally, the core accusation that Ellison is a “supporter of cop killers” is repeated in various forms throughout the article.
3.  **Slogans – No –** The text does not employ a brief, memorable phrase of its own to promote its message. It does quote a chant Ellison allegedly led, but this is used as evidence against him, not as a slogan for the article itself.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes –** The text links Ellison to “cop killers,” a “demonic religion,” and terrorists (like Assata Shakur, who is on the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorists List). This is intended to instill fear in the audience about the prospect of him becoming the “top law enforcement job in Minnesota.”
5.  **Doubt – Yes –** The article actively works to cast doubt on Ellison’s credibility and qualifications, stating “Ellison has baldly dissembled about this history” and that “he possesses no attorney's license that is valid.”
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes –** The text minimizes the journalist as a threat by sarcastically describing her as a “Female Journalist Armed With Mic & Camera Phone,” while exaggerating Ellison’s reaction as he “fled the scene.”
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes –** The article appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a defense of American law enforcement (police officers, the FBI) against an individual who allegedly supports their murderers, appealing to the audience's sense of national pride and order.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes –** The text is filled with emotionally charged and stereotypical language, such as “demonic religion,” “sordid history,” “gullible municipal authorities,” and “minions.”
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes –** While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses the defined technique of disapproving of Ellison by linking him to groups presented as hated by the audience, such as the Nation of Islam, the Symbionese Liberation Army, and “cop killers.”
10. **Bandwagon – No –** The article does not claim that its view is popular. In fact, it complains that Ellison’s constituents and a local newspaper “haven’t much cared about his history,” suggesting the author’s view is not the majority one.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes –** The text suggests that the primary cause for all of Ellison’s controversial actions and associations is a simple, singular character flaw: that he is a supporter of criminals and follows a “demonic religion,” ignoring any other political, social, or historical complexities.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No –** The article is not vague; it makes very specific accusations, citing names, dates, and organizations to support its claims.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes –** The author cites other sources to lend credibility to the claims, such as “Investigative journalist Laura Loomer,” Scott Johnson’s reporting in “The Weekly Standard,” and Bryan Burrough’s book “Days of Rage.”
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes –** The text presents only two options: Ellison is portrayed as a completely villainous figure who supports murderers and abuses women, while his opponents (like Laura Loomer) are portrayed as righteous journalists and victims. It offers no nuance or middle ground.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No –** The article does not use common, thought-ending phrases to shut down discussion. It relies on direct attacks and loaded language instead.
16. **Red herring – Yes –** The text includes a poll, repeated three times, asking “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” This topic is completely irrelevant to Keith Ellison and serves to distract the reader.
17. **Straw men – Yes –** The article refutes a nuanced view of Ellison’s political career by creating and attacking a simplified, distorted version of him as merely a “Cop Killer Supporter.” This misrepresents his positions to make them easier to attack.
18. **Whataboutism – Yes –** The central point of the article is to charge Ellison with hypocrisy. The text highlights the “irony is of Ellison's campaign calling on the police to protect him... when he has shown his support for those that murder police officers.”

***

**Verdict – 100% –** The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt an extremely negative view of a political figure by employing a vast arsenal of propaganda techniques. The article abandons any pretense of objectivity from the headline onward.

The piece is built on a foundation of **Name-calling** (“Cop Killer Supporter,” “effeminate man”) and **Loaded Language** (“demonic religion,” “sordid history”) designed to provoke an emotional, rather than a rational, response. It uses **Appeal to Fear** by linking Ellison to violent criminals and terrorists to suggest he is a danger to society.

The entire narrative is a **Black & White Fallacy**, portraying Ellison as purely evil and his critics as purely righteous. It constructs this narrative using a **Straw Man** argument, reducing his complex political history to the simplistic label of a “cop killer supporter,” and uses **Appeal to Authority** by citing other partisan sources to legitimize its attacks. The inclusion of a completely unrelated poll about Nikki Haley is a blatant **Red Herring**.

The overwhelming presence of 15 out of the 18 listed techniques demonstrates a deliberate and systematic effort to manipulate the reader's perception. The text is not a news report but a targeted character assassination piece.
