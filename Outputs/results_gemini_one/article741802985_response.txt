Name calling – Yes – The title labels the FBI as “Willfully Ignorant” and the perpetrator a “Muslim Jihadi.” The author also describes the FBI’s bafflement as part of its “deep, deep corruption.”

Repetition – Yes – The idea that the FBI is deliberately ignoring the motive of “global jihad” is repeated throughout the text, using phrases like “willful ignorance,” “deep, deep corruption,” and the assertion that the FBI “doesn’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad.”

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states that “there is a war going on” and that the FBI’s “willful ignorance leads to a diversion and waste of resources that is astronomical and catastrophic,” suggesting dire consequences for not accepting the author’s viewpoint.

Doubt – Yes – The entire text is built on questioning the FBI’s credibility and competence, stating that “given their track record of denial and deception, they may still be searching for Kazi’s motive” and calling their official stance part of a “deep, deep corruption.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the certainty of the motive, stating it is obvious, and describes the consequences of the FBI’s approach as “astronomical and catastrophic.” Conversely, the need for concrete evidence, which the FBI emphasizes, is minimized.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text frames the issue around national security by highlighting the target was a “U.S. Air Force Base” and that jihadist groups have called on followers to “kill military personnel.” This appeals to patriotic feelings about protecting the nation and its military.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language such as “Muslim Jihadi,” “Willfully Ignorant,” and “deep, deep corruption” to frame the narrative and evoke an emotional response rather than a rational one.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text makes a direct comparison to a hated enemy group, stating, “It’s as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier who crashed through the Ardennes Forest at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, to see if each one’s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler’s war aims.”

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular; in fact, it argues against the official narrative presented by the FBI and the media.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text assumes a single, simple cause for the event: “when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad.” This dismisses any other potential complex factors an investigation would explore.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s language is direct and not vague; their point is made very clearly and aggressively.

Appeal to authority – No – The text does not use an authority’s support as evidence. Instead, it quotes an authority (FBI agent Sean Ragan) in order to discredit and refute his statements.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two possibilities: either the incident is obviously an act of Islamic jihad (the author’s position), or the FBI is incompetent and corrupt for not seeing it. It doesn’t allow for the possibility of a thorough investigation that has not yet concluded.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “And that is that there is a war going on” is used to shut down further discussion or analysis. It’s presented as a fundamental truth that makes any investigation of motive by the FBI pointless.

Red herring – No – The text stays focused on its central argument about the FBI’s investigation and the motive for the attack; it does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the audience.

Straw men – Yes – The author creates a straw man of the FBI’s investigative process by sarcastically suggesting they are looking for an “ISIS membership card in his wallet, or lots of phone calls to Iraq or Syria.” This misrepresents the FBI’s actual position (a lack of evidence for a terror nexus) as a search for comically specific proof.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse the FBI of hypocrisy by pointing to other, unrelated actions.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, predetermined viewpoint by using a wide array of manipulative techniques.

The author begins by framing the entire event with a highly biased title using Name Calling (“Willfully Ignorant,” “Muslim Jihadi”) and Loaded Language. The central argument relies on Causal Oversimplification, asserting that the perpetrator's presumed religion is the only possible motive, thus dismissing the need for a standard investigation.

The text systematically employs techniques to undermine any opposing view. It casts Doubt on the FBI's credibility, calling them corrupt and deceptive. It creates a Straw Man of the investigation (the search for an "ISIS membership card") to make the official process seem ridiculous. It uses an Appeal to Fear by claiming the FBI's approach is "catastrophic" and a Black & White Fallacy by presenting only two options: the author's "obvious" truth or the FBI's "willful ignorance." The Reductio ad Hitlerum analogy comparing the FBI to an army failing to recognize the Nazis during WWII is a powerful emotional tool designed to shut down rational thought.

The inclusion of the factual Los Angeles Times article is itself a propagandistic device; it is used not as a source of information but as a foil to be mocked and discredited, reinforcing the author's narrative that the mainstream authorities are untrustworthy. The sheer density and combination of these techniques demonstrate a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions rather than engage in a reasoned, evidence-based argument.
