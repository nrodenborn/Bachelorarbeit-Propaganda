Name calling – Yes – The text labels clergy members it disapproves of as "perverts" and "fifth columnists," and describes the institutional Church as "lecherous and pathetic." Example: "McCarrick and his fellow perverts in the clergy are responsible, not only for their sexual abuses, but also for chasing good men away from the priesthood."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly blames the "spirit of Vatican II" and "aggiornamento" (modernization) for the Church's problems, linking it to the McCarrick scandal and other issues throughout the piece. Example: "I don’t know what it will take to exorcise the “spirit of Vatican II” – the spirit of aggiornamento – from the Church."

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan to rally support. Phrases like "spirit of Vatican II" are used as conceptual targets rather than standalone rallying cries.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text invokes supernatural threats and moral decay to create fear, suggesting the "Devil," "Satan," and "evil spirits" are at work, seeking the "ruin of souls." Example: "As Catholics, we ask St. Michael to “cast into Hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls.”"

Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on the legitimacy and wisdom of a major Church event. Example: "The idea that an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church would openly seek to “bring itself up to date” is ridiculous."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by claiming there is only one possible cause for the Church's problems. Example: "Why, there’s only one possible explanation: the Second Vatican Council."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the identity of devout Catholics by framing the argument as a duty for those who love the Church. Example: "Those who love our Holy Mother – those who want to protect her boys and men from all the McCarricks and their perverse appetites – mustn’t be deceived..."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to influence the reader's opinion. Example: "And how was such a depraved individual ordained in the first place, let alone promoted to Cardinal-Archbishop of Washington? The answer is, ultimately, demonic."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of modernizing movements within the Church by associating them with groups hated by the target audience, such as Marxists and French Revolutionaries. Example: "Perhaps the worst was Archbishop Marty of Paris, a leader of the “priest-worker movement” who defended Marxist and existentialist atheisms on the floor of the Council."

Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to popularity; in fact, it presents its own position as a brave stance against a popular, but misguided, trend ("aggiornamento").

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex, multi-faceted issue of clerical abuse and corruption down to a single cause. Example: "Where did those fifth columnists enter? Why, there’s only one possible explanation: the Second Vatican Council."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and its proposed cause, even if the reasoning is fallacious. It does not use vagueness to confuse the audience.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites figures like Pope Paul IV and Ross Douthat to lend credibility to its arguments. Example: "When he heard that the Council was being convened, then-Cardinal Montini is supposed to have sighed, 'This holy old boy doesn’t realise what a hornet’s nest he’s stirring up.'"

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between two extremes: a pre-Vatican II traditionalism versus a corrupt modernism, ignoring any middle ground or alternative views. Example: "Instead of serving as ambassadors from the City of God, far too many of our priests and prelates have become agents of the City of Man."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a supernatural explanation to shut down deeper, more complex analysis of the problem. Example: "The answer is, ultimately, demonic."

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the topic of the French *soixantehuitards* and Marxist movements to create a general sense of modernist decay, distracting from the need to draw a direct, evidence-based link between the Council's doctrines and McCarrick's specific crimes. Example: "During a homily at the Cathedral, he also praised the soixantehuitards: “the great outburst of the younger generation that suddenly wanted to take its place in life”..."

Straw men – Yes – The text sets up and refutes a weak or misrepresented argument—that Vatican II was *only* about updating the liturgy—to make its own argument seem more profound. Example: "It was not supposed (as some have claimed) to simply update the liturgy from its last redesign in 1570. The goal was to align the Church more with modern world..."

Whataboutism – No – The text focuses on a direct attack against its target (Vatican II) and does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly biased conclusion by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. The entire argument is built upon a foundation of logical fallacies, most notably a massive Causal Oversimplification that blames the complex crisis of clerical abuse entirely on the Second Vatican Council. This central fallacy is supported by numerous other techniques, including Loaded Language ("demonic," "perverts," "depraved"), Appeal to Fear (invoking Satan and the "ruin of souls"), Name Calling ("fifth columnists"), Black & White Fallacy (pitting the "City of God" against the "City of Man"), and Appeal to Authority. The piece systematically uses emotional manipulation and flawed reasoning to advance its agenda, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
