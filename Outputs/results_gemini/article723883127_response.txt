1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes a victim, Juan Carlos Cruz, describing the church officials as “truly crazy”.
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that the Pope is attacking victims and defending an accused bishop is repeated multiple times using different phrasing, such as “Openly Attacking Child Sexual Abuse Victims,” “attacking the credibility of child sex abuse victims,” and “accused victims of Chile’s most notorious pedophile of slander.”
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the single, impactful word “Shock!” as a headline to grab attention, and it highlights a victim’s powerful, memorable statement: “Nothing has changed, and his plea for forgiveness is empty.”
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses on generating outrage and criticism about a past event rather than instilling fear about a future consequence or alternative.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to cast doubt on the Pope’s sincerity and the Catholic Church’s credibility. It explicitly states the scandal has “cost the Catholic Church its credibility” and juxtaposes the Pope’s words with contradictory evidence to undermine his position.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The use of words like “Shock!”, “shocking move,” and “astonishing end” exaggerates the emotional impact of the event to frame it in the most dramatic terms possible.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to provoke an emotional response, such as “attacking,” “slander,” “notorious pedophile,” “disgust,” and “empty.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text reports that the Pope’s remarks “drew shock from Chileans and immediate rebuke from victims and their advocates,” encouraging the reader to align with this widespread negative reaction.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The final sentence simplifies a complex situation by concluding that the Church is “now apparently engaging in attacking the victims instead of actually going after the abusers,” attributing a single, malicious motive to the Pope’s actions.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and clear in its point of view and accusations; it does not use vague language to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text appeals to the authority of a “Chilean judge” and the Vatican’s own previous findings against Rev. Karadima to validate the victims' claims and discredit the Pope's current statements.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The final sentence presents only two possibilities: the Church is either “attacking the victims” or “actually going after the abusers,” ignoring any other potential nuances or explanations for the Pope’s comments.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The victim’s quote, “Nothing has changed, and his plea for forgiveness is empty,” serves as a powerful, definitive statement that discourages further critical thought on the matter.
16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on the central issue of the Pope’s comments and the abuse scandal without introducing irrelevant distractions.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text frames the primary purpose of the Pope's visit as to “‘heal’ the wounds,” and then presents his comments as a direct and deliberate attack on that mission, refuting a simplified version of his intentions to make his words seem more hypocritical.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text is making a direct accusation of hypocrisy; it is not deflecting criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it is based on a factual event (Pope Francis did make the reported comments), its presentation is heavily biased and employs a large number of propaganda techniques. The purpose is not to neutrally inform the reader but to persuade them to adopt a specific, outraged viewpoint. This is achieved primarily through the pervasive use of Loaded Language (“Shock!”, “attacking,” “notorious”) and Exaggeration to create an emotional, rather than a rational, response. The article systematically builds a case to cast Doubt on the Pope’s credibility by using Repetition, appealing to other Authorities (a judge, the Vatican’s past ruling), and employing a Black & White Fallacy to frame the situation in the starkest possible terms. The overall effect is a highly manipulative piece designed to solidify a negative opinion of the Pope and the Catholic Church, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
