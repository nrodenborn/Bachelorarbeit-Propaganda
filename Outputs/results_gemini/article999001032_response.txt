1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels attributed to a campaign staffer to attack the candidate, for example, “He is a part of the crazy, crazy, crazies,” and refers to Florida as a “cracker state.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that Gillum is making empty promises he cannot keep is repeated throughout the piece, starting from the headline (“Gillum Makes Promises He Can’t Keep”), a sub-headline (“Empty Promises Exposed”), and the body of the text (“Gillum campaign makes promises it knows it can’t keep”).
3. Slogans – Yes – The text highlights a brief, memorable phrase to encapsulate its message: “modern day fairy tales start with ‘once I am elected.’”
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text attempts to instill fear by revealing a supposed “Secret Gun Control Agenda,” suggesting Gillum intends to ban certain firearms, a common fear-based tactic in political messaging.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to create doubt about Andrew Gillum's credibility and honesty. The quote, “That’s not for [voters] to know,” is used to suggest a deliberate and conspiratorial deception.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggerated language to describe the campaign's strategy, such as the need to “whip them up into a frenzy,” which dramatizes standard get-out-the-vote efforts.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its position.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to evoke a negative response, such as “Deceiving Voters,” “crazy, crazy, crazies,” “frenzy,” and “white guilt.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by suggesting it is popular with a group like Nazis or a similarly hated group.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that people should oppose Gillum because he is becoming unpopular; rather, it argues that his existing popularity is based on lies.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex reasons why a political platform may not be fully achievable by attributing it to a single, simple cause: a deliberate plan to make “empty promises.” It states Gillum’s agenda cannot pass simply because of a “Democratic governor, Republican legislature,” ignoring the nuances of political negotiation.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is not vague; it makes very direct and specific accusations. It accuses the Gillum campaign of using obfuscation, but the article's own style is pointed and clear.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the president of Project Veritas Action, James O’Keefe, as an authority on uncovering campaign secrets. It also presents the campaign staffers as insider authorities revealing the “truth.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents Andrew Gillum in two mutually exclusive ways: the public, moderate-seeming candidate and the secret, “crazy” progressive. It leaves no room for political nuance or the possibility of having aspirational goals while facing political reality.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “modern day fairy tales start with ‘once I am elected’” is used as a cynical cliché to dismiss all of Gillum’s political promises without critical thought or engagement.
16. Red herring – No – The text remains consistently focused on its goal of discrediting Andrew Gillum and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the audience from its main point.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent and then refute Gillum's public arguments. Instead, it claims to be revealing a hidden agenda, which is a different persuasive tactic.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text is a direct attack on one subject and does not attempt to deflect criticism from another person or group by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its sole purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the audience to adopt an extremely negative view of a political candidate by employing a high concentration of propaganda techniques. The article is framed as an exposé, using selectively presented quotes from so-called insiders (Appeal to Authority) to create a narrative of widespread, intentional deception (Doubt). It heavily relies on emotionally Loaded Language (“crazy,” “frenzy,” “cracker state”) and Name Calling to discredit the candidate and his staff. It creates a sense of danger through an Appeal to Fear regarding a “secret” gun control agenda and simplifies complex political realities into a narrative of malicious intent (Causal Oversimplification). The use of a memorable Slogan (“modern day fairy tales...”) and the constant Repetition of the core message reinforce the propagandistic narrative. The piece makes no attempt at journalistic balance, context, or presenting an alternative viewpoint, confirming its function is purely persuasive and manipulative.
