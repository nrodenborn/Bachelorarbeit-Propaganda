Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **No** – No specific insulting labels are applied to the subject or opposing viewpoints.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The term "credible" is repeated three times in close succession ("credible evidence, credible information, regarding potential terrorist infiltration").
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – The text does not use a brief, memorable phrase designed for easy recall.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The core claim suggests "terrorist infiltration through the southern border" aided a horrific massacre, explicitly playing on fears of terrorism and border security.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The text implicitly questions the official narrative by presenting alternative claims ("secret intel", "more than one shooter", "ISIS connection") and referencing "alternative media reports" versus the mainstream.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – The claim of "conclusive fact that there was more than one shooter" based on eyewitnesses exaggerates the status of that evidence (contradicted by official investigations) and minimizes the complexity of the event and the reliability of eyewitness testimony under stress.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Words like "Credible Evidence", "Terrorist Infiltration", "horrific", "shockingly", "fateful night", and "secret intel" are emotionally charged and evoke strong negative feelings (fear, outrage) and assumptions.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No attempt is made to link the subject to a universally hated group like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – The text states this information "lines up with other alternative media reports" and relies on the claim "dozens of eyewitnesses" to support the multiple shooter theory, implying these sources lend credibility and popularity to the claims.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – The core argument simplifies the complex Las Vegas Massacre down to a single, unproven cause: "terrorist infiltration through the southern border" connected to ISIS, ignoring other factors and evidence.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – The "secret intel" is never described or sourced beyond Perry's claim. Terms like "some sort of terrorist infiltration," "potential terrorist infiltration," and "credible information" are vague and lack concrete details.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The entire premise relies on the authority of Congressman Scott Perry ("Congressman says", "Perry described evidence he had personally seen", "Perry shockingly claimed"). His position as a Congressman is used as evidence for the claim.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – The text doesn't explicitly present only two stark choices; it focuses on promoting one alternative narrative.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Phrases like "Let’s face it" and "We also know" are used to present controversial claims as settled facts, discouraging further questioning or critical examination.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The mention of Stephen Paddock’s girlfriend deleting her Facebook page is irrelevant to the core claim of terrorist infiltration/ISIS connection but is included, likely to distract or imply guilt by association.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument not actually made by opponents of its view.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not charge opponents with hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on **Appeal to Fear** (terrorist infiltration via border), **Loaded Language**, **Appeal to Authority** (Congressman Perry), **Causal Oversimplification**, **Obfuscation** ("secret intel"), **Bandwagon** (alternative media, eyewitnesses), **Repetition** ("credible"), **Doubt** (of official narrative), **Exaggeration** (multiple shooters as "conclusive fact"), **Thought-terminating clichés**, and a **Red Herring** (girlfriend's Facebook). The core claims are presented as shocking revelations based on unnamed "secret intel" and align with conspiracy theories (like multiple shooters and Infowars), while lacking verifiable evidence and using emotionally manipulative language. The primary function appears to be promoting a specific, fear-based narrative about border security and terrorism linked to a tragedy, rather than presenting objectively verifiable facts.
