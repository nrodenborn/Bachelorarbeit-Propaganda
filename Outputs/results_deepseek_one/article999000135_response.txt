Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "absolute hypocrite", "hypocritical, lying, fake news outlet", "useful idiot, propagandist snowflake".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated verbatim three times.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, memorable phrase is coined or prominently featured.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Describes migrants as having "busted through customs gates", "pushed at the Mexican border", "committing all sorts of crimes", and being "intent on violating the law". Portrays them as a threat needing military force.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions Don Lemon's credibility: "How can he contradict himself like that and not even bat an eyelid?", "Lemon said what is clearly not only racist but utterly insane."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – *Exaggeration:* Describes migrant actions as "busted through customs gates", "committing all sorts of crimes". Calls Lemon's statement "utterly insane". *Minimization:* Dismisses concerns about demonizing migrants ("No one is demonizing an ethnicity") while maximizing the focus on Lemon allegedly demonizing white men.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to national identity and law: "illegally enter the country against our immigration laws", "declaring that we will not allow such persons across our border is simply common sense".
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Uses highly charged, emotional words throughout: "hypocrite", "lying, fake news", "illegally", "busted through", "crimes", "racist", "utterly insane", "demonizing", "useful idiot", "propagandist snowflake", "violating the law".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis or Hitler is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – While implying CNN is wrong, it doesn't appeal to the idea's popularity as a reason to believe it.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The text doesn't assign a simple cause to a complex event.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and accusatory, not vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – No authority figure is cited to support the claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as either accepting all migrants (as Lemon allegedly wants) or using military force/border security (as common sense). Also frames Lemon's view as "He just doesn't want white men here."
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Uses "simply common sense" to shut down debate about border policy and dismiss opposing viewpoints ("you won't get common sense on CNN").
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Shifts focus from analyzing Lemon's specific statement about white men to attacking the migrants ("busted through customs gates... committing all sorts of crimes") and criticizing CNN broadly. The migrant caravan details distract from the core criticism of Lemon's alleged contradiction.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Misrepresents Lemon's position: "He just doesn't want white men here." Lemon did not say this; he identified a specific group (radicalized white men) as the biggest terror threat and argued against demonizing migrants.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Charges Lemon with hypocrisy: "No one is demonizing an ethnicity but Don Lemon. He is the one demonizing white men. How's that for hypocrisy?" This directly accuses him of doing the very thing he cautioned against.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of defined propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to aggressively attack Don Lemon and CNN using emotionally charged language (Name Calling, Loaded Language), distortions (Straw Men, Exaggeration), logical fallacies (Black & White, Whataboutism, Red Herring), and appeals to fear and national identity. The repetitive poll question acts as reinforcement (Repetition), and phrases like "simply common sense" shut down opposing views (Thought-terminating cliché). The overwhelming reliance on these manipulative techniques, coupled with the lack of substantive evidence or balanced argumentation, makes it highly likely this text functions as propaganda aimed at discrediting specific targets and promoting a specific, polarized viewpoint.
