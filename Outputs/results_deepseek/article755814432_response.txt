Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "neocons" is used repeatedly as an insulting label for Giuliani, Bolton, and others. "Bombastic Giuliani" is also a direct insult.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The concept of "blowback" is repeated multiple times (e.g., "concept of 'blowback'", "blowback is real", "worry about blowback"). "Neocons" is also repeated frequently.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable, slogan-like phrase is used to encapsulate the core message beyond potentially "blowback," but it's presented more as a defined concept than a slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text repeatedly warns of disastrous consequences ("Unmitigated disaster after disaster", "blowback is real", "the real threat!") if Trump/Giuliani's plan for Iran (unleashing terrorists/regime change) is followed, instilling fear against that alternative.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions the credibility/understanding of Giuliani and neocons: "Giuliani never really understood", "he either doesn’t get it or doesn’t want to get it", "refuse to understand it".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates the influence of lobbies: "foreign lobbies and special interest groups maintain an iron grip on our foreign policy". Minimizes Iran's potential threat: "Iran does not threaten the United States".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While it mentions US interests and threats, it doesn't overtly appeal to patriotism or national identity as a primary argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Uses emotionally charged or stereotype-evoking terms: "violent Islamist-Marxist cult", "terrorists", "bombastic", "incredibly stupid", "unmitigated disaster", "fully-neoconized".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No attempt to link the criticized idea (regime change via MEK) to groups specifically hated by the audience (like Nazis) to disapprove of it.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Does not appeal to the popularity of the author's position ("open up to Iran with massive amounts of trade") as a reason to adopt it.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes complex events (9/11, disasters in Iraq/Libya/Syria) primarily to a single cause: "US meddling and military occupation" or "unleashing terrorists"/regime change policies, ignoring other contributing factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The arguments are presented clearly and directly, not in an intentionally obscure or confusing way.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites the "US intelligence community and particularly by the CIA" to validate the concept of "blowback".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the options for Iran policy as either disastrous regime change/unleashing terrorists OR opening up with trade/travel ("Why not open up...?" "better to unleash terrorists... than to engage them in trade...?"), ignoring potential middle grounds or other approaches.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – While it uses strong language and repetition, it doesn't employ specific clichés designed to shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is", "don't rock the boat"). "Blowback" is explained and argued.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on criticizing US policy towards Iran, the MEK, and neocons, and the concept of blowback. The poll about "corrupt Democrat Politician" is a clear distraction, but it's presented as separate content (likely an ad), not part of the article's argument.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Characterizes the neocon position simplistically as wanting to "unleash terrorists on a population" and implies they believe this is better than trade/travel ("Does anyone (except for the neocons) really believe it is better...?"), which may not be an accurate or fair representation of their full argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The question "How did that work in Libya?" references past policy failure to criticize the current proposed policy, but it's not used to charge an opponent with hypocrisy on an unrelated issue. The focus remains on the validity of the policy itself.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a significant number of propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Straw Men). Its primary purpose is not simply to inform but to aggressively persuade the reader against a specific policy (Trump/Giuliani/neocon plans for Iran) and promote an alternative view (engagement via trade/travel). It uses emotionally charged language, attacks the motives and understanding of opponents, simplifies complex causality, presents false dilemmas, and leverages fear of consequences ("blowback," "disaster") to discredit the opposing viewpoint. While based on factual elements (MEK's history, Giuliani/Bolton's speeches, the policy paper), the presentation is heavily slanted and employs classic persuasive/propagandistic methods to advance a specific political agenda against neoconservative interventionism. The embedded poll, while a distraction, is separate from the article's core propagandistic message.
