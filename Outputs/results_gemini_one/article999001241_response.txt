5. Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the integrity of the US election system by stating, "...what appears to be voter fraud and election meddling and manipulation across the country..." without providing any evidence.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites "A report from RT" and quotes "President Donald Trump" to lend credibility to its narrative.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll about Jim Acosta presents a false dichotomy in its "No" option: "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass." This implies the only reason to deny his pass is his "childlike" behavior, ignoring any other potential arguments.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any common clichés to shut down debate.
16. Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of the poll, "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?", is a clear red herring, as it is completely irrelevant to the article's topic of the migrant caravan and serves only to distract the reader.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It goes far beyond objective reporting by employing a significant number of propaganda techniques to shape the reader's perception. The article frames the migrant caravan as a threat using loaded language ("enter our country illegally") and appeals to fear ("undeterred" by "troops"). It distracts from the main topic with a major red herring—the completely unrelated poll about Jim Acosta, which itself uses name-calling and repetition. Furthermore, it seeks to undermine faith in democratic institutions by inserting a vague, unsubstantiated, and exaggerated claim about "voter fraud and election meddling." The combination of these techniques indicates a clear intent to persuade and manipulate the audience toward a specific political viewpoint rather than to inform them impartially.
