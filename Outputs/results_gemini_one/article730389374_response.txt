Name calling – Yes – The text labels the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD) as a "charter member of the War Party," which is an insulting label used to attack the group's credibility and motives.

Repetition – No – The text develops a consistent argument but does not repeat the same specific words or phrases over and over in the manner of a rhetorical device.

Slogans – No – The text does not use or promote any brief, memorable phrases as slogans to rally support for its own position.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that deeper commitment in Syria could lead to a situation where the U.S. and Turkey, both NATO allies, "may soon be staring down each other's gun barrels," and that previous wars have left the U.S. "bleeding, bankrupt, divided and disillusioned."

Doubt – Yes – The author questions the official narrative about the Iranian drone, asking, "why would Iran, which, with Assad, Russia and Hezbollah, is among the victors in Syria's six-year civil war, wish to reignite the bloodletting...?" This casts doubt on the stated cause for the conflict.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses phrases like "endlessly enmeshed" to exaggerate the potential duration of U.S. involvement and describes a potential Iranian action as an "act of monumental stupidity," which is a form of exaggeration.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to American patriotism and national interest by contrasting it with the interests of other nations, asking, "But while Israel's interests are clear, what would be the U.S. vital interest?"

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "broken and bleeding country," "reignite the bloodletting," and describes the U.S. as potentially becoming "bleeding, bankrupt, divided and disillusioned" to evoke strong negative emotions about war.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person, group, or idea to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text argues against the position of what it calls the "War Party," rather than suggesting its own view is popular and should be followed for that reason.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text argues against a simple cause for the conflict, suggesting the situation is highly complex with multiple actors and motivations, rather than attributing it to a single, simple cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's language is direct and his argument is clear. He is not deliberately using unclear or obscure expressions to confuse the audience.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites authorities like "The Wall Street Journal op-ed page," "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson," and an Israeli intelligence chief to represent the pro-intervention argument it opposes. It also appeals to the authority of candidate Donald Trump's past statements to support its own argument: "When he was running , Donald Trump seemed to understand this."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the solution as a choice between two options: "active diplomacy, not military action," which presents a binary choice and ignores other potential strategies or combinations of approaches.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text actively encourages critical thought by asking a series of rhetorical questions designed to make the reader consider the consequences of military action.

Red herring – No – All the points raised in the text, such as the actions of Israel, Iran, and Turkey, are directly relevant to the central topic of U.S. policy in Syria.

Straw men – No – The text quotes its opponents (e.g., The Wall Street Journal op-ed, the FDD) directly to establish their position before arguing against it. It does not appear to misrepresent their arguments.

Whataboutism – No – The text critiques the motivations and goals of its opponents but does not accuse them of hypocrisy by pointing to their own past actions.

Verdict – 85% – The text is an opinion column, a format that is inherently persuasive, but it heavily employs numerous propaganda techniques to advance its non-interventionist argument, pushing it beyond simple opinion and into the realm of propaganda. The author uses Name-Calling ("War Party") to discredit opponents, Loaded Language ("broken and bleeding country") and Appeal to Fear ("staring down each other's gun barrels") to create a strong emotional aversion to war. It casts Doubt on the official narrative regarding Iran's actions to weaken the justification for conflict. Furthermore, it uses Flag-Waving to frame the issue as a matter of American self-interest versus the interests of other nations ("what would be the U.S. vital interest?") and presents a Black & White Fallacy ("diplomacy, not military action") to narrow the reader's perceived options. While it is structured as a reasoned argument, its heavy reliance on these emotional and manipulative techniques is intended to persuade the reader by bypassing purely logical consideration, making it a clear example of propaganda.
