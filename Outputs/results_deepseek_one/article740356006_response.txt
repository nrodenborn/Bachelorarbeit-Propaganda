### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda**. It employs at least 9 of the 18 techniques (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, straw men, whataboutism) to manipulate perception. The author selectively presents Rep. Davis’s contradictory statements about Farrakhan while omitting context (e.g., Davis’s disavowals of anti-Semitism). Emotionally charged language ("racist hate group," "satanic," "useful idiots") and false equivalences (KKK comparison) dominate over balanced analysis. The tone is sarcastic ("Progress!") and accusatory, framing Democrats as enablers of extremism without evidence beyond Davis’s individual actions. While based on real quotes, the text’s structure—repeated disavowal-retraction cycles, guilt-by-association with J Street, and reductionist labels—aims to delegitimize Davis and his party rather than inform. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges factual elements (e.g., Farrakhan’s history) but the persuasive intent and rhetorical tactics overwhelmingly align with propaganda.
