### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Muslim spies," "jihad spies," "treason." Insults targeting IT aides and Democrats.  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" repeated 3 times.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Congress must investigate and act" (brief, directive phrase).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "Bank account she controlled was drained," "treason and espionage," "threatened her" to instill fear.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Media has refused to cover it" questions credibility of news outlets.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "Biggest story of treason" (exaggeration); media focus on "titillating porn stories" (minimization of legitimate reporting).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "Treason," "espionage," and "foreign governments" imply threats to national security, appealing to patriotism.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Collusion," "nefarious purposes," "jihad spies," "squirrel these jihad spies" evoke emotion/stereotypes.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – "Retailing Soviet fictions" links media to a hated regime (USSR).  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Poll lists "most corrupt Democrat Politician," urging readers to join condemnation.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames cybersecurity breaches solely on "Muslim IT staffers," ignoring complexity.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Accusations are specific (e.g., "thousands of illegal logins").  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites "House investigators," "Capitol Police," and the *Daily Caller* as authoritative sources.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Portrays Democrats as "corrupt" traitors colluding with spies; implies no middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Congress must investigate and act" shuts down debate with a directive.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – "They’re hellbent on destroying President Trump... porn stories" distracts from the IT scandal.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Claims media focuses on "Soviet fictions and titillating porn stories" instead of the story (misrepresents media priorities).  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No direct accusation of hypocrisy against critics.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Use of Techniques**: 15/18 propaganda techniques are present, dominated by *name-calling*, *fear appeals*, *loaded language*, and *oversimplification*.  
2. **Dehumanizing Language**: Repeated use of religious/ethnic labels ("Muslim spies," "jihad spies") to stoke xenophobia and equate Islam with treason.  
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Fear-driven claims (drained bank accounts, death threats) and nationalistic rhetoric ("treason," "foreign actors") override evidence-based discourse.  
4. **Partisan Agenda**: Uncritically frames Democrats as complicit in espionage while dismissing media as conspiratorial ("Soviet fictions").  
5. **Omission of Context**: Fails to substantiate key allegations (e.g., "USB drive to Pakistani senator") with verified sources, relying on insinuation.  
6. **Call to Action**: The poll and directive ("Congress must investigate") aim to mobilize readers against a manufactured threat.  

**Why not 100%?**  
The core story references real investigations (Capitol Police, House IG), but these are weaponized via cherry-picked details and hyperbole. The overwhelming reliance on manipulative techniques overshadows any factual basis, rendering the text primarily propagandistic.
