1. Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack any person or group.
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat a specific message or phrase for rhetorical effect.
3. Slogans – No – The text reports on statements but does not employ brief, memorable phrases as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – “The U.S. Conference of Mayors will continue doing everything in our power to keep our communities safe so that children and families are able to live free of the fear of being gunned down.” This statement supports the proposed policies by invoking the fear of being a victim of gun violence.
5. Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or group.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text reports on statements and events without obvious exaggeration or minimization.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism. It mentions the Second Amendment only to state that the proposed policies are consistent with it.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – “Mayors are on the frontlines of America’s gun violence crisis, so it’s no surprise they’re also leading the charge to pass common-sense, life-saving laws.” Phrases like “gun violence crisis,” “common-sense,” and “life-saving” are emotionally charged to frame the issue and the proposed solutions in a highly positive light.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – “It’s time for our leaders in Washington to follow the lead of America’s mayors and put public safety over NRA priorities.” This is a direct appeal for leaders to join the "winning side" or follow the popular action taken by the large group of mayors.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – “Policies like background checks on all gun sales and Red Flag Laws save lives.” This statement presents a simple cause (these specific laws) for a desired effect (saving lives), ignoring the complex array of factors that contribute to violence and safety.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is clear in its reporting of the resolutions and the statements made.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – “The bipartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors passed a series of resolutions calling for more gun control measures...” The entire article uses the authority and collective voice of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, as well as the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, as evidence for the validity of the proposed policies.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – “It’s time for our leaders in Washington to follow the lead of America’s mayors and put public safety over NRA priorities.” This presents only two choices: siding with the mayors for public safety or siding with the NRA, falsely implying these are the only two options and that they are mutually exclusive.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – “...pass common-sense, life-saving laws.” The phrase "common-sense" is used to frame the policies as obviously correct, thereby discouraging any critical thought or debate about their potential complexities or drawbacks.
16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on the topic of the mayors' conference and gun control resolutions.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that was not presented.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge any opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 75% – The text is presented as a neutral news report, but it functions as propaganda by selectively presenting information that promotes one side of a political issue. The article exclusively quotes sources who support the gun control measures, framing them with loaded language like "common-sense" and "life-saving." It makes no attempt to include opposing viewpoints or critical perspectives, such as from the NRA or other gun-rights advocates. The entire piece is structured as an appeal to authority (the U.S. Conference of Mayors) and uses bandwagon appeals ("follow the lead of America's mayors") and false dichotomies ("public safety over NRA priorities") to persuade the reader. While it reports on a real event, the biased framing and use of multiple propaganda techniques within the chosen quotes make it a clear piece of persuasive communication rather than objective journalism.
