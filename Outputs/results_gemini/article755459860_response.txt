***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It is not an objective news report but an opinion piece designed to persuade the reader to adopt a specific anti-interventionist viewpoint. It achieves this by employing a vast majority (16 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques. The author uses emotionally loaded language, appeals to fear by warning of another "Ukraine situation," employs whataboutism to deflect from Iran's issues by pointing to US corruption, and introduces a completely irrelevant red herring in the form of a political poll. The entire piece is framed with slogans and thought-terminating clichés ("Here We Go Again") that discourage critical thought and push a predetermined conclusion. While it quotes from a news article, the purpose is to use that information as a basis for a highly biased and persuasive argument rather than to inform.
