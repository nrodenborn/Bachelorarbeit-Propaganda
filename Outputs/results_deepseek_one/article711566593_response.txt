Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "criminal illegal", "false-documented illegals", "privileged class" (used to label Garcia Zarate/immigrants negatively).
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – No single phrase or message is repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "no justice, no peace" (used at the end to encapsulate a feeling and call to action).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "a career criminal who is not even supposed to be in the country can literally get away with murder", "anybody can get away with violating U.S. immigration law" (instills fear about illegal immigration and sanctuary policies).
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution" (questions the credibility/efforts of the prosecution).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "the felony firearms charge, the only charge" (minimizes the significance of the guilty verdict); "literally get away with murder" (exaggerates the legal outcome, as he was found not guilty of murder charges).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While American rights/the legal system are mentioned, there isn't a strong explicit appeal to patriotism as the core persuasive device.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "preventable and heartbreaking death", "disgraceful verdict", "horrifying", "vindication for the rights of immigrants" (used sarcastically), "foment hate", "program of mass deportation", "philosophy of hate", "languishing in jail", "privileged class" (emotionally charged words and phrases throughout).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler or Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text doesn't primarily argue that an idea is popular to promote it.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames sanctuary city policy solely for Steinle's death: "San Francisco’s sanctuary city policy 'led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle'", ignoring other complex factors like the handling of the firearm, ballistics evidence, and the specific legal arguments at trial.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is generally direct and clear in its assertions, not deliberately obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Jeff Sessions ("According to the Attorney General’s statement..."), Ben Shapiro ("Conservative Ben Shapiro told Fox news the verdict was 'horrifying'"), and President Trump ("President Trump tweeted...") to support the negative view of the verdict and immigration policies.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents immigrants (specifically undocumented ones) as a "privileged class" getting away with murder vs. victims like Kate Steinle and her family. Ignores nuance in immigration status, individual circumstances, and the legal process.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Justice was rendered, but it was not served" (used by Kate's father to shut down further discussion of the verdict's validity); "Politics trumps evidence in California once again" (used by Shapiro to dismiss the jury's decision).
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Extensive focus on Garcia Zarate's immigration status, prior deportations ("seven-time felon and has been deported five times"), and San Francisco's sanctuary policy distracts from the core legal question of whether the prosecution proved murder/manslaughter *beyond a reasonable doubt* based on the evidence presented at trial.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Portrays the defense's argument about bias as "politically correct nonsense" and implies the defense wanted this outcome regardless of the tragedy ("prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted"), misrepresenting the defense's actual legal arguments and duty to their client.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – While Gonzalez mentions Trump/Sessions being under investigation, it's framed as a call for them to reflect on the presumption of innocence *before* criticizing *this* verdict, not primarily as an accusation of hypocrisy to deflect criticism. The core deflection technique here is the Red Herring (immigration status).

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs numerous techniques (Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating Clichés, Red Herring, Straw Men) to advance a specific, highly emotional narrative about illegal immigration, sanctuary cities, and the justice system. It consistently frames the event and its participants (Garcia Zarate as a privileged criminal alien, San Francisco authorities as enabling tragedy, the verdict as a horrific injustice) using inflammatory language and selectively presented facts. The primary goal appears to be persuading the audience of the dangers of illegal immigration and sanctuary policies by exploiting the emotional weight of a tragic death, rather than providing a balanced analysis of the complex legal case or its outcome. While it reports facts (the verdict, statements, Garcia Zarate's history), these facts are presented within a heavily biased framework designed to evoke anger and confirm a pre-existing viewpoint.
