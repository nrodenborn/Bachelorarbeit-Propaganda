4. **Appeal to fear** – **No** – No attempt to instill fear about alternatives.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "But while the Democrats are in a lather over Ford and Kavanaugh... they couldn’t care less about Karen Monahan" (Questions Democrats' sincerity).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "Abundant evidence" (exaggerates support for Monahan) vs. "absolutely no evidence whatsoever" (minimizes Ford’s allegations).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No appeal to patriotism or national identity.

### Verdict – 85% Propaganda – Detailed Explanation:  
The text exhibits **multiple propaganda techniques** with clear intent to manipulate perception:  
- **Partisan Framing**: Labels Ellison as "Muslim Brotherhood Congressman" (Name Calling) to evoke bias.  
- **False Equivalence**: Compares Monahan/Ford cases using exaggerated/minimized evidence (Exaggeration/Minimization) to imply Democratic hypocrisy.  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded terms like "pure politically-motivated hypocrisy" frame Democrats as insincere activists.  
- **Bandwagon & Whataboutism**: Suggests consensus on Democratic hypocrisy ("anyone didn’t know") while deflecting from Ellison’s alleged actions.  
- **Black & White Fallacy**: Reduces the #MeToo movement to political opportunism, ignoring nuanced positions.  

While based on factual events (Monahan’s allegations), the text **selectively presents information** to advance a partisan narrative, discredit Democrats, and shield Ellison from scrutiny. The absence of techniques like Fear or Slogans doesn’t negate the overwhelming use of manipulative tactics. Thus, the piece functions primarily as propaganda, not balanced reporting.
