Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "your addition 'in individual cases' is absolutely worthless". This insults the German bishops' proposal.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The phrase "there is only one Catholic answer: No!" is stated twice verbatim ("Dear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode, there is only one Catholic answer: No!").
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – While "No!" is emphatic and repeated, it lacks the crafted, memorable phrase quality of a slogan like "BUILD THE WALL!".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The quote from Isaiah ("Woe to you that call evil good...") and the warning that such actions draw "God's punishment, with thick cords!" instills fear of divine retribution.
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – The text expresses strong certainty ("there is only one Catholic answer", "absolutely worthless", "it is clear") rather than raising doubts about opponents' credibility.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** (Exaggeration) – Claiming that contradicting two popes "probably has never happened before in the Church's history" is likely an overstatement of the novelty and severity of the dissent.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Repeated appeals to Catholic identity, doctrine, and authority (e.g., "only one Catholic answer", citing scripture, popes, and theologians) serve as appeals to religious identity and loyalty.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Terms like "sinful conduct", "call evil good", "cultural revolution" (used pejoratively), "perish", and "God's punishment" carry strong negative emotional connotations and invoke stereotypes of sin and divine wrath.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – While concentration camps are mentioned ("one could not bless a concentration camp"), it's used as an example of something inherently un-blessable, not to directly compare the German bishops' idea to Nazis or label them Nazi collaborators.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Lists supporters (Archbishops Schick & Chaput, theologians Windisch & Büning) and claims "I am sure there are many many others" to imply his position is widely held and correct.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The arguments are based on theological reasoning about sin and blessings, not a simplistic cause for a complex event.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The language is direct and argumentative, aiming for clarity ("The answer is simple", "it is clear") rather than confusion. The mention of the Pope's "cultural revolution" being unexplained is criticized, not employed by the author.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites scripture (Isaiah, John the Baptist), Church authority (Archbishops, Theologians, Popes), and Church tradition ("one Catholic answer") as evidence for the position.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the issue as strictly binary: either bless sin (which is forbidden) or don't. The possibility of nuanced interpretations or pastoral considerations is dismissed ("absolutely worthless", "no argumentative force").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – The text uses reasoned theological arguments and scriptural references rather than simplistic phrases designed to shut down thought. "No!" is emphatic but argued for.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The lengthy discussion about Professor Chiodi's views on contraception and the Pope's "cultural revolution" comment distracts from the core issue of blessing same-sex unions.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The author directly addresses the German bishops' proposal ("blessing homosexual unions", "in individual cases") and argues against it based on his interpretation of blessing sin.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The author does not charge Marx/Bode with hypocrisy by pointing to their other actions or inconsistencies. He directly condemns their specific proposal.

**Verdict – 65% –** The text exhibits a significant number of propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Bandwagon, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Red Herring). Its primary purpose is to vehemently oppose the German bishops' proposal using emotionally charged language, appeals to religious identity and fear, simplification of the issue, and attempts to show popular support within the faith. While it presents theological arguments, the heavy reliance on persuasive and emotionally manipulative techniques moves it strongly towards propaganda. However, the presence of some theological reasoning prevents it from being purely propagandistic.
