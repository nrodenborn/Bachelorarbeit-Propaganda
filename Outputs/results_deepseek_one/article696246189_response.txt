### Verdict – 40% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text **contains elements of propaganda** but is primarily factual. Propaganda techniques appear in embedded social media posts (e.g., loaded language, doubt, bandwagon) and the red herring diversion to the "mystery woman." However, the core reporting clarifies misinformation (e.g., revealing the note’s true purpose via police testimony) and avoids emotional manipulation in its narrative. The sensationalism is largely confined to quoted tweets, while the body of the article focuses on investigative updates. This mix reduces its propagandistic weight, though selective emphasis on conspiracy theories (before debunking) shows mild bias. Thus, it is more **sensational journalism** than outright propaganda, but uses propagandistic tactics in ≈40% of its content.
