**Verdict – 80% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to persuade the audience of the severity of the situation and to call for specific actions, such as the resignation of Pope Francis and other Church leaders. The use of emotionally charged language and the presentation of a simplified narrative contribute to the likelihood that the text is propaganda. However, the detailed nature of the text and the lack of certain techniques, such as slogans or whataboutism, suggest that it is not entirely propagandistic.**
