4. **Appeal to fear** – No – Focuses on past injustice, not future threats.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions credibility of Obama administration: "politically motivated," "They interpreted the law in my case... but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton."

10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity.

13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Relies on personal experience, not external authorities.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents justice system as only two options: equal prosecution or "two-tier" bias, ignoring case nuances.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases halting debate (e.g., "correct the wrong" invites action, not ends discussion).

### Verdict – 80% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Selective Framing**: Focuses exclusively on Saucier’s perspective, painting him as a victim of political bias while downplaying the severity of his actions (e.g., destroying evidence, photographing classified reactor systems).  
2. **Propaganda Techniques**: Uses repetition, loaded language, whataboutism, and black/white fallacy to amplify the "two-tier justice" narrative and delegitimize the Obama administration.  
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Highlights Saucier’s hardships (job loss, foreclosure) to evoke sympathy, contrasting it with Clinton’s lack of prosecution.  
4. **Omission of Context**: Ignores key differences between cases (e.g., Saucier’s obstruction of justice vs. Clinton’s lack of intent proven). Trump’s endorsement and pardons are framed as heroic without scrutiny.  
5. **Source Bias**: Relies heavily on Saucier and his lawyer’s claims via Fox News—a platform known for partisan narratives.  

**Why not 100%?**  
The core event (Saucier’s pardon and lawsuit) is factual, but the presentation weaponizes the story to advance a political agenda (e.g., undermining trust in Democratic leadership). This aligns with pro-Trump/anti-Obama propaganda common in conservative media.
