Name calling – Yes – The Westerville Police Chief is quoted as saying there is “a special place in hell for those people” who were creating fake GoFundMe pages and making threatening calls.

Repetition – No – The text is a news report and does not repeat a specific message or phrase in a propagandistic manner.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as slogans.

Exaggeration/minimization – No – While the language is strong, it is used to describe a double murder and is not an obvious exaggeration or minimization of the event's severity.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The Police Chief calls the fallen officers "true American heroes," and the Ohio Governor ordered flags to be flown at half-staff, both of which are appeals to patriotism.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text and its quotes use emotionally charged words and phrases like "slaying," "gunned down," "horrible shooting," "terrible tragedy," and "ambushed & killed" to evoke a strong emotional response from the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.

Straw men – No – The text is a report, not an argument, and does not misrepresent or refute an argument that was not made.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 40% – The text is a news article, and its primary function is to report the facts of a crime. In this capacity, much of the text is informational and not propagandistic. However, the article's framing relies heavily on direct quotes from authority figures that employ clear propaganda techniques, including Loaded Language, Flag-Waving, Name Calling, and Appeal to Authority. By selecting and highlighting these emotionally charged and patriotic statements without any counter-narrative, the article amplifies a specific, pro-law enforcement viewpoint and is designed to shape the reader's emotional response. While not pure propaganda, its heavy use of quoted propaganda pushes it significantly in that direction.
