Verdict – 75% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and red herring. These techniques are used to create a narrative that questions the competence of the authorities and suggests a cover-up, while also appealing to emotions and national identity. The presence of these techniques indicates a high likelihood that the text is propaganda, aiming to influence the audience's perception of the investigation and the authorities involved.
