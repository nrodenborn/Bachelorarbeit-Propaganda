Name calling – Yes – The text quotes the statement which calls the Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith. It also quotes Bishop Schneider describing modern society as a “real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.”

Repetition – Yes – The phrase “sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage” is used multiple times to reinforce the core message of the profession.

Slogans – Yes – The subheading “Raising a Common Voice” is used as a brief, memorable phrase to rally support for the cause.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that the alternative interpretation of Amoris Laetitia is causing “rampant confusion” and will spread “a plague of divorce” in the Church.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to cast doubt on the validity of certain interpretations of Pope Francis's apostolic exhortation, stating that such a reading is “alien” to the Church’s faith and “contrary to Divine Revelation.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggerated language to describe the consequences of the Pope's perceived stance, such as causing “rampant confusion” and spreading “a plague of divorce.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to Catholic identity and tradition by quoting Bishop Schneider’s appeal to his conscience as one of the “Successors of the Apostles” and framing the issue as a defense of “the Church’s entire faith and Tradition.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “alien,” “plague of divorce,” “sexual depravity,” and “rampant confusion” to influence the reader's perception.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – Yes – The article emphasizes the growing number of signatories (“bringing the total number of signatories to eight bishops and one cardinal”) and explicitly notes the invitation for the world’s 5,000 bishops to sign, suggesting that this is a growing and popular movement to join.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests that certain pastoral norms for implementing *Amoris Laetitia* will directly cause a “plague of divorce,” which is a simple cause for a complex social and religious phenomenon.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is not intentionally vague. It accuses others of using vague language (“beautiful explanations” like “discernment” and “pastoral accompaniment”) but its own message is presented clearly.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The article’s primary method of persuasion is listing the names and titles of the high-ranking prelates who have signed the profession (cardinal, archbishops, bishops), using their ecclesiastical authority as evidence for the position’s validity.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between upholding the “Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage” on one side, and an “alien” interpretation that is “contrary to Divine Revelation” and allows sin on the other, ignoring any possibility of a valid, nuanced middle ground.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text quotes Bishop Schneider saying, “We were forced by our conscience... As Successors of the Apostles, Schneider said they ‘could not act in another way.’” This presents their actions as an absolute, non-debatable moral imperative, discouraging further critical thought on their reasoning.

Red herring – No – The text remains focused on the central topic of the profession and its signatories without introducing irrelevant material to distract.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the arguments for a different pastoral approach by simplifying and misrepresenting them. It claims that concepts like “discernment” and “pastoral accompaniment,” when translated into “common sense language,” are “tantamount to an allowance to sin,” which is a caricature of the opposing theological argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge opponents with hypocrisy by pointing out their own unrelated faults.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text, while presented in the format of a news article, is overwhelmingly a work of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to neutrally inform the reader but to persuade them of a specific viewpoint and rally support for a cause. This is evident in the sheer number and variety of propaganda techniques it employs. The article heavily relies on **Appeal to Authority** by meticulously listing the titles of the prelates who support the "Profession." It uses the **Bandwagon** technique by highlighting the growing number of signatories to create a sense of momentum. The language is saturated with emotionally **Loaded Language** and **Name Calling** ("alien," "plague," "neo-pagan") and stokes an **Appeal to Fear** by warning of "rampant confusion" and a "plague of divorce." It creates a **Straw Man** of the opposing argument by reducing complex theological concepts to "an allowance to sin" and presents a **Black & White Fallacy** by framing the issue as a choice between immutable truth and heresy. The consistent use of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than to facilitate a balanced understanding of the issue.
