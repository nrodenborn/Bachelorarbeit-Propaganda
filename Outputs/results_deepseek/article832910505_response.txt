Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Mueller Circus," "swamp," "inevitable lies, smears and assaults," "coup members." These are insulting labels.
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated use of "circus" (title, "Mueller circus," "proper Roman circus").
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrase is used as a slogan.
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "bringing us that much closer to a proper Roman circus" implies investigations will lead to chaos/persecution.
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "inevitable lies, smears and assaults" questions the credibility of the Mueller report and its authors.
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "made the media ten times that more," "fortunes... are priceless" (exaggeration). Minimizes the legitimacy of investigations as a "circus".
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "swamp," "spite," "malice," "tribal rage," "coup," "assaults," "conspiracy theories." Emotionally charged terms.
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association with universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes complex investigations solely to goals like keeping "media happy," "undermine Trump," or "spite," ignoring legal/process reasons.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – No deliberately unclear phrasing; claims are direct.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authoritative figures cited as evidence.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – "The more Trump is investigated, the less he can investigate" presents a false dichotomy (investigations vs. reforms).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Never underestimate the power of the swamp's spite" shuts down critical analysis of motives.
16. **Red herring** – No – All points relate to the central theme of attacking investigations.
17. **Straw men** – Yes – "Punish the voting public for electing Trump" refutes a motive not seriously presented by opponents.
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – "assaults from the Obama/Clinton team" deflects criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy/prior misconduct.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 11 distinct propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-Terminating Clichés, Straw Men, Whataboutism). The core arguments rely on emotionally charged language, conspiracy framing ("coup," "swamp"), unsubstantiated claims of malice/spite, and deliberate misrepresentation of opponents' motives. It offers no verifiable evidence, factual counterarguments, or balanced perspective. Its primary goal is to delegitimize investigations and manipulate readers through fear, anger, and tribal loyalty ("culture wars," "resistance"), not to inform or engage in reasoned discourse. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the existence of real investigations as a factual basis, but their portrayal is entirely distorted by propaganda techniques.
