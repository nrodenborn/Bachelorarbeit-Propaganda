### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Labels Omar as "hateful" and implies Tlaib is a "foe of Israel." Example: "The hijabed (and therefore pro-Sharia) Ilhan Omar, meanwhile, is even more hateful than Tlaib."  
2. **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: No single message is repeated persistently; criticisms vary.

5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Questions Omar’s integrity by highlighting allegations of fraud. Example: "Omar has faced allegations... of immigration fraud and student loan fraud."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggerates Omar’s actions as "even more hateful" and minimizes the legitimacy of Tlaib’s views. Example: "Omar is even more hateful than Tlaib."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to patriotism by praising "pro-America, pro-Israel candidates" and framing critics as "anti-American." Example: "Forthrightly pro-America, pro-Israel candidates would stand little to no chance."  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged terms like "vendetta," "genocidal incitement," and "hateful sad man." Example: "The House’s vendetta against the Middle East’s only democracy."

10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: Does not claim ideas are popular to persuade.

### Verdict – 95% – Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It systematically employs multiple techniques—including **name-calling**, **appeal to fear**, **loaded language**, **causal oversimplification**, and **straw men**—to vilify Tlaib and Omar while promoting a partisan narrative. It selectively omits context (e.g., Tlaib’s aid conditions), uses unverified allegations (Omar’s marriage), and frames dissent as inherently anti-American or anti-Israel. The tone is emotionally manipulative, relying on stereotypes (e.g., linking hijabs to "pro-Sharia" views) and apocalyptic predictions (e.g., "renewed jihad attacks"). While it cites sources like JTA or Daily Wire, these are cherry-picked to support bias, and the author’s self-citation substitutes for impartial evidence. The text’s goal is not balanced analysis but to delegitimize political opponents through fearmongering and identity-based attacks, hallmarks of propaganda. The 5% uncertainty stems from factual elements (e.g., election results), but these are weaponized to advance the agenda.
