1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses numerous insulting labels to attack Dina Habib Powell and her associates, such as “McMaster’s Huma Abedin,” “part of the swamp,” and “Islamic apologist H. R. McMaster.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the poll question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” three times in a row. It also repeatedly mentions Powell’s connections to Huma Abedin and the Clintons.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the well-known political slogan “part of the swamp” to concisely label Powell as part of a corrupt establishment.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states that the rumor of Powell’s nomination is “devastating” and warns that her appointment would be a return to the “failed incoherent foreign policy of the Obama era,” instilling fear about the potential consequences of her appointment.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text uses rhetorical questions to cast doubt on Powell’s loyalty and Trump’s judgment, such as, “Is it any wonder Habib Powell was a major White House source of the negative leaks to the enemedia?” and “Why would President Trump go back to there?”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by describing the rumor of Powell’s candidacy as “devastating.” It also states that “Longtime Geller Report readers have suffered Powell for well over a decade,” which is an exaggeration of the impact of a political figure on a readership.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a battle for America’s correct foreign policy, contrasting the “failed” globalist approach of Powell with the implied pro-American vision of President Trump. For example: “Flynn made the NSC into a tool that matched Trump’s vision. McMaster is remaking it to match Jeb Bush’s vision.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases designed to create a negative impression, such as “willfully ignorant,” “Islamic apologist,” and “enemedia.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler or Nazis, the technique’s definition is to disapprove of an idea by associating it with groups hated by the audience. The text does this by linking Powell to “Muslim Brotherhood front groups” and the “PLO’s Hanan Ashrawi.”

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text creates an appeal to join a group with a shared opinion by stating, “Longtime Geller Report readers have suffered Powell for well over a decade,” implying that a large group of people already holds this negative view.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies a complex personnel decision into a single cause: “It’s not hard to see why McMaster pushed out McFarland and elevated Habib-Powell,” reducing the event to a simple ideological clash.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text makes a major accusation using vague sourcing: “Two separate National Security Council sources have confirmed that National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster and Deputy National Security Advisor Dina Powell have been leaking negative material...”

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from sources that the intended audience would see as authoritative to support its claims. For example: “Daniel Greenfield said this about Dina Habib Powell:...” and it presents a long list of points from “Breitbart.”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two choices for foreign policy: the correct one that matches “Trump’s vision” or the “failed incoherent foreign policy of the Obama era” that Powell supposedly represents, ignoring any possibility of nuance or other options.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like “She is part of the swamp” and “Never Trumpers” to dismiss individuals and their arguments without substantive discussion, thereby discouraging critical thought.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a long, irrelevant story about a completely different person, “Ambassador Nancy Powell,” and her actions in Pakistan. This serves only to distract and create a negative association with the surname “Powell.”

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a misrepresentation of an opponent's argument by claiming H.R. McMaster “subscribed to the Obama view that Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam.” This creates a simplified, easily attackable caricature of a more nuanced position.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges Powell with hypocrisy by contrasting her past actions with the Trump administration's agenda: “While President Trump fights to restrict Muslim immigration, at his side is the woman who had once bragged on CNN, ‘Over 90% of student visas are now issued in under a week, and that is in the Middle East.’”

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt an extremely negative view of Dina Habib Powell and to actively oppose her potential nomination. The article forgoes reasoned argumentation and instead relies almost exclusively on a dense and layered application of propaganda techniques.

The text systematically employs nearly every technique from the provided list. It opens with **name-calling** (“McMaster’s Huma Abedin,” “swamp”) and **loaded language** (“devastating,” “enemedia”) to establish an immediate emotional bias. It builds its case not on verifiable facts but on **association fallacies**, repeatedly linking Powell to individuals and groups the target audience is conditioned to dislike (the Clintons, Huma Abedin, Valerie Jarrett, George Soros, the PLO).

It uses **appeals to fear** by warning of a return to “failed” policies and casts **doubt** on Powell’s loyalty with rhetorical questions. The argument is bolstered by **appeals to authority** (quoting Daniel Greenfield and Breitbart) and presents a **black & white fallacy** where the only options are Trump's "correct" vision versus a disastrous alternative. Perhaps most blatantly, it uses a **red herring** by including a long, irrelevant story about a different person named Powell to confuse the reader and create a negative association. The sheer volume and combination of these techniques, woven into every paragraph, confirm that the text is not a good-faith argument but a deliberate work of propaganda.
