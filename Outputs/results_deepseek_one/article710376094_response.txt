### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques:

1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation:* The term "potentially hazardous" is a scientific classification by the Minor Planet Center, not an insulting label.  

2. **Repetition** – No  
   *Explanation:* While "potentially hazardous" appears twice, it is contextually reiterated for clarity, not as a deliberate propaganda tactic.  

3. **Slogans** – No  
   *Explanation:* No brief, memorable phrases are used to rally support (e.g., no equivalents to "BUILD THE WALL").  

4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
   *Explanation:* Though "potentially hazardous" sounds alarming, the text neutrally explains the term and reassures readers the asteroid will "miss the Earth."  

5. **Doubt** – No  
   *Explanation:* No questioning of credibility; sources like NASA are presented factually.  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No  
   *Explanation:* "Skim by" is relative to astronomical scales, but the text clarifies the distance (6.5M miles) and compares it to the moon’s distance, avoiding distortion.  

7. **Flag-Waving** – No  
   *Explanation:* No appeals to patriotism or group identity.  

8. **Loaded Language** – No  
   *Explanation:* Language is descriptive (e.g., "spectacular show" for the meteor shower) but not emotionally manipulative.  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *Explanation:* No references to hated groups (e.g., Nazis) or comparisons.  

10. **Bandwagon** – No  
    *Explanation:* No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").  

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No  
    *Explanation:* Complex topics (e.g., asteroid composition) are explained without oversimplifying causes.  

12. **Obfuscation** – No  
    *Explanation:* Details (e.g., distance, size) are clearly stated, not obscured.  

13. **Appeal to authority** – No  
    *Explanation:* NASA and the Minor Planet Center are cited for factual context, not to overawe readers.  

14. **Black & white fallacy** – No  
    *Explanation:* No false dilemmas (e.g., "only two options") are presented.  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No  
    *Explanation:* Phrases like "the real question is" invite curiosity, not shut down thought.  

16. **Red herring** – No  
    *Explanation:* All details (e.g., meteor shower origins) directly relate to the asteroid.  

17. **Straw men** – No  
    *Explanation:* No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  

18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    *Explanation:* No accusations of hypocrisy or deflections.  

### Verdict – 0% –   
*Explanation:* The text is purely informational, citing scientific sources (NASA, Minor Planet Center) to explain astronomical phenomena. It uses neutral language, avoids emotional manipulation, and provides context (e.g., clarifying "potentially hazardous" as a technical classification). Reassurances about safety ("expected to miss the Earth") and educational details (e.g., asteroid vs. comet composition) further demonstrate its intent to inform, not persuade. No propaganda techniques are employed.
