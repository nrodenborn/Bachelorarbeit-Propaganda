### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "mainstream hack politician" (insulting label for Farage).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" repeated three times.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used for persuasion.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings about "global jihad threat," historical accounts of Muslim subjugation (e.g., "humiliate," "curse of Allah"), and claims the West will "lose" without action.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Farage’s credibility: "remarkable ignorance of history," and "No sane person is saying..." implying his argument is irrational.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes Farage’s stance as "denial and appeasement"; exaggerates historical Islamic texts as universally representative.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeals to patriotism or identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Terms like "sabotage," "jihad terror," "humiliate," "exterminate the infidels," and "hardline interpretations" evoke negative emotions.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No linkage to hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified causes; historical context is provided.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct; quotes are specific.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites the author’s own book ("I document this abundantly in my new book") as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents a false dilemma: either confront Islamic texts or "appease" jihadis (e.g., "if we don’t speak about such facts, how will we ever convince Muslims...?").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All content relates to the core argument.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents Farage’s warning as opposing *any* discussion of Quranic justification ("he is saying that we must not speak about how jihadis find justification..."), which Farage never stated.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy.

### Verdict – 80% –   
The text is highly likely propaganda due to:  
1. **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language (e.g., "jihad terror," "humiliate") and fear appeals dominate.  
2. **Ad Hominem Attacks**: Dismisses Farage as a "mainstream hack politician" instead of engaging his argument.  
3. **Misrepresentation**: Uses a straw man to distort Farage’s position and historical quotes selectively to imply Islam is inherently warlike.  
4. **Repetition & Bias**: The triplicate poll question amplifies anti-Democrat sentiment, distracting from the article’s focus.  
5. **False Dilemma**: Frames resistance to jihad as binary—either reject Islamic texts entirely or surrender to extremism—ignoring nuanced approaches.  
6. **Self-Authority**: Cites the author’s book as definitive proof, bypassing critical evaluation.  
However, it avoids some techniques (e.g., obfuscation, whataboutism) and includes verifiable quotes, reducing the score marginally. Its primary goal is to delegitimize Farage and stoke fear about Islam, not foster balanced discourse.
