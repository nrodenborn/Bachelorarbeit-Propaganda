Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels for groups, such as calling Muslims in France "Muslim settlers" and European authorities "insane".

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly presents a pattern: a violent attack is committed by a Muslim shouting "Allahu Akbar," and the authorities then blame "mental illness." This narrative structure is repeated with examples from France, Germany, Russia, and Amsterdam to reinforce the central message.

Slogans – No – The text quotes slogans used by attackers ("Allahu Akbar", "Long live Hitler, to death the Jews") but does not use its own slogans to promote its message.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text describes multiple violent, unprovoked attacks (stabbings, beatings, a beheading) to instill fear in the reader, suggesting that official inaction is allowing these dangers to persist and grow.

Doubt – Yes – The entire piece is constructed to cast doubt on the credibility and competence of European authorities. The final lines, "Maybe it's not the terrorists who are nuts. Maybe it's the authorities who are insane," directly question their judgment.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text accuses authorities of minimizing the threat of terrorism by labeling it "mental illness." It also uses exaggeration with the sweeping statement, "They're all crazy in Europe."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to group identity by highlighting the Jewish identity of victims (e.g., "69-year-old Jewish man (wearing a kippah on his head)") and framing the events as a conflict between "Muslim settlers" and the native European/Jewish population, thereby appealing to the reader's sense of in-group identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language, such as "Muslim settlers," and sarcastically describes official statements as "bafflingly inscrutable" to evoke an emotional response rather than a rational one.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text explicitly links an attacker to a group hated by the audience by quoting him as shouting, "Long live Hitler, to death the Jews."

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is good because it is popular. In fact, it argues against what it portrays as the popular or official consensus.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue. It argues that the sole reason for the authorities' conclusions is a deliberate effort to cover up Islamic terrorism, ignoring other potential factors like actual mental illness, legal standards for criminal responsibility, or political caution.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s writing is direct and clear in its message and accusations. It accuses the authorities of obfuscation but does not use the technique itself.

Appeal to authority – No – The text does not use an authority's support as evidence. On the contrary, it consistently attacks and undermines the conclusions of authorities like the police, doctors, and judges.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two possibilities for the attackers' motives: either they are driven by Islamic terrorism (the author's position) or they are simply "mentally ill" (the position the author attributes to the authorities). It dismisses any nuance or possibility that both could be factors.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text presents the official diagnosis of "mental illness" as a kind of thought-terminating cliché used by authorities to shut down further discussion. The author's own line, "They're all crazy in Europe," is also a sweeping cliché that discourages nuanced thought.

Red herring – No – The text remains highly focused on its central argument. All the examples provided are used to directly support the claim that authorities are mislabeling terrorism as mental illness.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified and uncharitable version of the authorities' position. It presents the "mental illness" diagnosis as a simple, absurd excuse, rather than the potential outcome of complex legal and psychiatric evaluations, making it easier to attack and ridicule. For example, the parenthetical "(That would be Islamophobic.)" creates a straw man of the motive for the official conclusion.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect blame or criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy on an unrelated issue. It stays focused on its critique of European authorities' handling of specific attacks.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It employs a dense and varied combination of propaganda techniques to advance a specific, highly biased narrative. Rather than presenting a balanced report, its primary goal is to persuade the reader by stoking fear, anger, and distrust. It achieves this through the use of loaded language and name-calling ("Muslim settlers") to dehumanize one group while systematically discrediting official institutions ("insane" authorities) through techniques like doubt, straw man arguments, and presenting a black-and-white fallacy. The repetitive structure, which hammers home the same point with a series of emotionally charged examples, is designed to bypass critical analysis and create a strong, negative emotional consensus in the reader. The text is not an attempt to inform, but a deliberate effort to shape opinion and incite a specific emotional and ideological response.
