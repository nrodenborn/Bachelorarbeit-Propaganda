1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to describe opposing societal trends, such as calling modern society a “real neo-pagan society” and describing divorce as a “plague” and sexual behavior as “sexual depravity.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The phrase “Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage” is repeated multiple times throughout the text to reinforce its importance.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase “Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage” is used as a brief and memorable rallying cry for the position being advocated.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns of a “real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading,” instilling fear about the consequences of not upholding the "immutable truths."
5. Doubt – No – The text does not explicitly question the credibility of a specific person or group; it focuses on affirming its own position.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text describes divorce as a “plague,” which is an exaggeration to emphasize its negative impact. The significance of ten bishops (out of over 5,000 in the world) signing the document is also arguably exaggerated by the dedicated article.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a shared Catholic identity by referencing “the Church’s received teaching,” “the constant truths of the Church,” and the need to defend “the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases such as “Immutable Truths,” “sanctity,” “plague,” and “sexual depravity” to evoke strong emotional responses.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with hated groups like Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The article’s core purpose is to show a growing list of signatories (“Tenth bishop signs,” “brings the number of signatories to nine bishops and one cardinal”), implying that the movement is gaining momentum and that others should join.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text implies that societal problems like divorce and “sexual depravity” stem from a simple cause: a failure to adhere to the Church’s traditional teaching on marriage, ignoring other complex societal factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear about its position, who supports it, and what document they signed. It is not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The entire article is built on this technique, listing the names and titles of bishops, an archbishop, and a cardinal (“His Excellency Elmar Fischer,” “Cardinal Janis Pujats,” etc.) to lend credibility to the “Profession.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a choice between defending the “sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage” and succumbing to a “real neo-pagan society,” ignoring any nuanced theological positions or alternative viewpoints.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like “Profession of Immutable Truths” and “the constant truths of the Church” are used to frame the position as absolute and not open to critical thought or discussion.
16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on the central topic of the bishops signing the profession and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not present and then refute a specific, distorted argument from an opponent; it primarily asserts its own position.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly propagandistic. While it reports on a factual event (a number of bishops signing a document), its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the reader to support a specific viewpoint. This is achieved by heavily employing a wide range of propaganda techniques. The article is framed as an "us vs. them" narrative, pitting the "defenders" of marriage against a "neo-pagan" society. The core of the article is a combination of Appeal to Authority (listing the credentials of the signatories) and Bandwagon (emphasizing that the list of signatories is growing). This is reinforced with Loaded Language ("sanctity," "plague," "depravity"), Appeal to Fear (warning of societal collapse), and Flag-Waving (appealing to a specific Catholic identity). A neutral news report would likely provide more context on the wider debate within the Church, include perspectives from those with differing theological views, and report the number of signatories in the context of the total number of bishops worldwide. This text exclusively presents one side in the most favorable and urgent light possible, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
