   *Explanation:* The report describes events neutrally (e.g., "killing 58 people") without exaggerating threats to manipulate emotions.

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No  
   *Explanation:* Statistics (e.g., "58 killed, 422 injured") are reported factually; no understatement/overstatement detected.

   *Explanation:* No appeals to patriotism or group identity (e.g., no "protect our nation" rhetoric).  

8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes**

    *Explanation:* Authorities (FBI, police) are cited for facts, not to imply unquestionable truth.

---

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is a factual news report from CNN, detailing Douglas Haig's arrest, his connection to the Las Vegas shooter, and legal proceedings. It cites evidence (e.g., fingerprints, complaint details), includes balanced perspectives (Haig’s attorney, law enforcement), and avoids overt persuasion. The term "massacre" in photo captions is emotionally charged but contextually accurate for an event with 58 deaths. No systematic use of propaganda techniques is observed; the piece prioritizes information over manipulation. The 5% reflects minor emotional language, not propagandistic intent.
