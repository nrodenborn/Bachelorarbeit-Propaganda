Verdict – 40% – The text contains elements of propaganda, such as doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, and appeal to authority. These techniques suggest a bias against the Obama Administration's actions regarding the Iran nuclear deal. However, the text also includes responses from former Obama officials, providing a counter-narrative and some balance. The presence of these propaganda techniques indicates a moderate likelihood of the text being propaganda, but the inclusion of multiple perspectives reduces the overall percentage.
