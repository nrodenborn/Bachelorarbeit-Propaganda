Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Cop Killer Supporter Keith Ellison", "epitome of an effeminate man", "follows a demonic religion, Islam", "minions", "Hakim Muhammad". These are insulting labels.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "BUILD THE WALL!" is not used, but the text quotes Loomer's tweet: “We don’t get no justice, you don’t get no peace.” as a chant Ellison led.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Portrays Ellison as a dangerous figure: supporting "cop killers", following a "demonic religion", abusing women, and being unfit for office, implying his election poses a threat (e.g., "Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Repeatedly questions Ellison's credibility regarding the abuse allegations ("claimed the women were lying"), his legal credentials ("he possesses no attorney's license that is valid"), and his past statements ("Ellison has baldly dissembled about this history").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: Describing Loomer as "a woman armed with a mic and camera phone" to imply she was a threat, calling Islam a "demonic religion". Minimization: Downplaying the seriousness of the crimes of individuals Ellison allegedly supported (e.g., describing Kathleen Soliah as a "social justice warrior").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Implicitly appeals to patriotism/law-and-order identity by strongly siding with police victims ("cop killers", "murder of police officers in cold blood") and portraying Ellison as an enemy of law enforcement.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Pervasive emotionally charged language: "demonic religion", "effeminate man", "Cop Killer Supporter", "abusing women", "fled the scene", "minions", "sordid history", "baldly dissembled", "dupes", "terrorist career", "Shame on you".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – While Islam is negatively labelled ("demonic religion") and the National Lawyers Guild is called an "old Communist front group", no direct comparison to Hitler or Nazis is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text does not primarily argue that Ellison's views are wrong because they are unpopular or that opposing views are right because they are popular. It focuses on attacking him.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Simplifies complex events to imply direct guilt by association: Ellison's appearance with Sharif Willis shortly after Haaf's murder and his support for other controversial figures is used to imply direct support for the *specific act* of killing Officer Haaf ("support for cop killers", "taking the side of their murderers").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – While biased and inflammatory, the text makes specific (though contested and interpreted) claims. It doesn't rely on deliberately vague phrasing to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites police ("An Officer in Minnesota informed me"), Loomer's tweet/video, Scott Johnson's reporting, and historical documents (Weekly Standard, St. Paul Pioneer Press) to lend credibility to its claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents Ellison as unequivocally guilty, dangerous, and hypocritical ("supports cop killers" but seeks police protection), with no nuance or consideration of alternative explanations. Portrays supporters like Willis or Soliah as purely evil ("cop killers", "terrorist") while dismissing any context.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Uses phrases like "Shame on you, Hakim Muhammad!" and definitive labels like "Cop Killer Supporter", "demonic religion", and "effeminate man" to shut down critical examination.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The entire embedded poll about Nikki Haley's replacement ("Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?") is completely irrelevant to the story about Keith Ellison and serves as a distraction/sign-up incentive.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Reframes Ellison's defense against abuse allegations as simply claiming "the women were lying" without engaging with any specific arguments he might have made. Portrays his past associations and statements in the most extreme negative light possible ("support for cop killers").
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text focuses exclusively on attacking Keith Ellison. It does not primarily defend others by charging Ellison (or his supporters) with hypocrisy *relative to someone else's actions*; the hypocrisy charge ("irony") is self-contained to Ellison's actions (seeking police protection vs. alleged support for cop killers).

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a significant majority of the defined propaganda techniques (14 out of 18). Its primary purpose is not to inform objectively but to aggressively discredit and vilify Keith Ellison using highly inflammatory language (Name Calling, Loaded Language), emotional manipulation (Appeal to Fear, Flag-Waving), logical fallacies (Black & White, Causal Oversimplification, Straw Men), selective and interpreted facts presented as absolute truth (Doubt, Appeal to Authority), repetition, and distractions (Red Herring). The extreme negativity, reliance on guilt-by-association, demonization of Islam, and lack of balanced perspective or credible counter-argument presentation are hallmarks of propaganda aimed at shaping a deeply negative perception of the subject.
