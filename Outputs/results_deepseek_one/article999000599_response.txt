Here's the analysis of the text using the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "queen of virtue-signaling opportunism", "apparently mind-numbed audience". These are insulting labels.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: No specific phrase or message is repeated insistently throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrase is used as a rallying cry within the text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – Explanation: The text mocks and criticizes but does not instill fear about the consequences of alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Hillary Clinton appears to benefit from her progressive privilege" questions the fairness/credibility of her treatment and media coverage. The question "what would have happened if Trump said it?" explicitly casts doubt on double standards.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: The headline labels the joke a "Racist Joke". Describing the audience reaction as "howls of laughter from the apparently mind-numbed audience" exaggerates the scene and minimizes their response as unintelligent.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: "paragon of political-correctness", "queen of virtue-signaling opportunism", "evil and awful conservative opponents", "hypocritically", "howls of laughter", "apparently mind-numbed audience", "progressive privilege", "dismissed in disgrace". These terms carry strong negative connotations and appeal to emotions/stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No association with Nazis or other universally hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: No appeal is made to the popularity of an idea or action.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text recounts an event and criticizes hypocrisy/double standards but doesn't attribute a complex situation to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The author's criticism and recounting of the event are clear, not deliberately obscure or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: The conclusion cites Kyle Olsen ("As The American Mirror’s Kyle Olsen concludes so eloquently") to support the author's point about Clinton's "progressive privilege".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: While critical, the text doesn't present only two starkly opposed options as the sole possibilities.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: No phrases are used that explicitly shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is").
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: The question "what would have happened if Trump said it?" introduces the hypothetical reaction to Trump saying something similar, which is irrelevant to the core issue of whether Clinton's comment was inappropriate. It distracts from evaluating her comment on its own merits.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The author quotes Clinton directly and criticizes her based on those quotes; they don't misrepresent or refute an argument she didn't make.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: While the Trump hypothetical (Red Herring) is related, it's not strictly used to charge Clinton *herself* with hypocrisy *on this specific issue* (e.g., "But what about when Clinton did X?"). It's used to highlight perceived media/system hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits strong characteristics of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not neutral reporting but to aggressively discredit Hillary Clinton using multiple persuasive and manipulative techniques. Key indicators include:
*   **Heavy Use of Loaded Language & Name-Calling:** Terms like "queen of virtue-signaling opportunism," "evil and awful," "mind-numbed audience," and "progressive privilege" are emotionally charged and derogatory, framing Clinton negatively from the outset.
*   **Exaggeration:** Labeling the joke definitively as "racist" in the headline and describing the audience reaction hyperbolically frames the event in the most damaging light possible.
*   **Creating Doubt:** Explicitly questioning the fairness of her treatment ("progressive privilege," the Trump hypothetical) seeks to undermine trust in media/institutions protecting her.
*   **Appeal to Authority & Red Herring:** Citing Olsen bolsters the "privilege" claim, while the Trump comparison distracts from the core incident.
*   **Clear Bias & Persuasive Intent:** The overall tone is highly sarcastic ("Childish, indeed. Insulting, indeed.") and relentlessly critical. The framing (headline, source - ZeroHedge, concluding rhetorical question) is designed to provoke outrage against Clinton and promote a specific narrative of liberal hypocrisy and double standards. While based on a real event (her comment), the presentation and language choices are overwhelmingly geared towards persuasion and condemnation rather than objective analysis. The 15% reservation acknowledges the factual basis of the incident being reported.
