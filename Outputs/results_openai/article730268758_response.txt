Verdict – 75% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, such as name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques suggest a strong likelihood of the text being propaganda, as they are used to shape the reader's perception of Pope Francis and the Church's handling of abuse cases. However, the text also provides detailed information and specific accusations, which could indicate an attempt at investigative reporting rather than pure propaganda.
