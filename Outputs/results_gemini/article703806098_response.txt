1. Name calling – Yes – The text attacks the official story by labeling it "complete nonsense."
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message of "multiple active shooters" and a "cover-up" that "contradicts the official story" is repeated multiple times throughout the text to reinforce the main point.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases that could be considered slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting a "widespread cover-up" by powerful, unnamed "authorities" and "government officials," and by highlighting the death of an eyewitness, implying danger for those who contradict the official story.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire purpose of the text is to question the credibility of the "official story" and "authorities," stating that they are "actively covering up what really happened."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the certainty of its claims, presenting a short audio clip as definitive "proof" and calling it a "bombshell" and "stunning," which overstates its evidentiary value.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text makes an appeal to national identity by stating, "the American people are clearly not being told the truth," framing the issue as a deception against the entire country.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "bombshell," "widespread cover-up," "stunning," "complete nonsense," and "shockingly" to manipulate the reader's emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparison to Hitler or other groups widely hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that its viewpoint is becoming popular by citing "dozens of eyewitness reports," a "now viral article," and "multiple investigative reports conducted by other alternative media outlets."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for its conclusion, suggesting that a confusing quote from an air traffic controller during a crisis is direct and simple proof of a complex, multi-shooter conspiracy.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text is intentionally vague about who is behind the alleged conspiracy, referring only to "authorities" and unnamed "government officials and private companies."
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses "political strategist" Mike Tokes and journalist Shepard Ambellas as authorities to lend credibility to its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either the official "lone gunman" story is true, or there was a massive, multi-shooter conspiracy. It ignores the possibility of simple confusion and miscommunication during a chaotic event.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like "complete nonsense" and "the American people are clearly not being told the truth" are used to end discussion and assert a conclusion as obvious without providing full evidence.
16. Red herring – Yes – The introduction of Kymberley Suchomel's death from "natural causes" is a red herring. It is an irrelevant detail used to introduce a sinister element and distract from the lack of direct evidence connecting her death to a cover-up.
17. Straw men – No – The text attacks the actual official narrative (a lone gunman) rather than a distorted version of it.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect from its subject by accusing its opponents of hypocrisy on an unrelated matter.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and definitive example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, conspiratorial viewpoint by employing a dense and varied arsenal of propaganda techniques. The piece systematically uses emotional manipulation (Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear), logical fallacies (Black & White Fallacy, Causal Oversimplification, Red Herring), and techniques to discredit its target (Name Calling, Doubt, Repetition). It simultaneously attempts to build its own credibility through false consensus and questionable sources (Bandwagon, Appeal to Authority). The language is intentionally vague and exaggerated to create suspicion and distrust in official institutions. Rather than presenting evidence objectively and considering alternative interpretations, the text constructs a narrative designed to lead the reader to a single, predetermined conclusion, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
