1. Name calling – Yes – The author directly attacks the cleric with an insulting label at the beginning of the text: “When he says that Muslims never killed Jews just for being Jews, he is lying”.

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question is repeated three times in a row to reinforce the message: “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?”

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses a brief and memorable phrase as a call to action that encapsulates the author's viewpoint: “Don’t allow yourself to be deceived by the likes of Jihad Al-‘Ayesh.”

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear of being misled by a dangerous ideology by warning the reader not to be fooled: “Don’t allow yourself to be deceived by the likes of Jihad Al-‘Ayesh.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire premise of the author's argument is to cast doubt on the credibility of the Muslim cleric’s statement: “When he says that Muslims never killed Jews just for being Jews, he is lying, and relying on the historical ignorance of his audience.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text quotes the cleric minimizing the Holocaust: “First of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The embedded poll appeals to a specific American political identity by focusing on Democratic politicians, thereby invoking partisan loyalties: “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to create a strong negative impression: “massacring Jews”, “wholesale slaughter”, “rioting Muslims, enraged”, “murdered four thousand Jews”.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The quoted cleric attempts to discredit Zionism by equating it with Nazism: “When we say ‘Final Solution,’ we realize that many of the terms used by the Zionist state constitute Nazi terms, ideas, and notions. It is as if they are two faces of the same coin.”

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The quoted cleric frames sympathy for Jews as a negative trend or "fashion" that people are following, implying one should not join in: “Some people have shown up with a new fashion... the vogue today is to sympathize with the Jews”.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The quoted cleric reduces the complex historical reasons for the persecution of Jews to a single, simple cause: “The Jews were banished, tortured, and annihilated because of their deeds. They were not banished for being Jews.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The quoted cleric uses a confusing and logically flawed analogy about a bakery to obscure the facts about the Holocaust and confuse the audience: “How many ovens would you need to burn six million human beings?”

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites a historian to support his claim and also presents himself as an authority by promoting his book on the subject: “The twelfth-century Muslim historian Ibn Baydhaq detailed…” and “In my new book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS…”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a binary choice: either the cleric is telling the truth (that Muslims *never* killed Jews for being Jews) or the author is (that Muslims did, and their history is one of violence). This ignores any historical nuance or periods of relative peace.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The quoted cleric uses the phrase “two faces of the same coin” to equate Zionism and Nazism, a simplistic cliché designed to end nuanced discussion.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a political poll that is completely irrelevant to the topic of Islamic history and the Holocaust in order to distract the reader: “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?”

17. Straw men – Yes – The quoted cleric refutes an oversimplified argument by claiming, “The Jews claim that it happened to them alone,” which misrepresents the historical understanding that Nazis targeted many groups, even if Jews were the primary target of the genocide.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The quoted cleric deflects from the discussion of the Holocaust by bringing up crimes committed by others: “When the Americans occupied the republics of the Indians, they annihilated millions of human beings.”

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to engage in a balanced, academic discussion, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint towards Islam and to discredit a specific opponent. It achieves this by employing a vast and comprehensive array of propaganda techniques.

The piece immediately sets a confrontational tone with name-calling (“lying”) and establishes the author as the sole authority on the “truth.” It uses emotionally loaded language (“massacring,” “slaughter”) and appeals to fear (“Don’t allow yourself to be deceived”) to manipulate the reader's emotions.

Crucially, the text includes a blatant red herring—the poll about Democratic politicians—which has no relevance to the article's subject matter and serves only to distract and appeal to a specific political identity. Furthermore, the text is a multi-layered piece of propaganda, as it uses the propagandistic statements of the cleric (Holocaust minimization, whataboutism, straw men) as a springboard for the author's own propaganda, creating a powerful "us vs. them" narrative. The combination of direct attacks, logical fallacies, emotional manipulation, and self-promotion of the author's own material confirms that the text's intent is persuasive and ideological, not educational or objective.
