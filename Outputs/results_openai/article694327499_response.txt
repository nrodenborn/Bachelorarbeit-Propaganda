**Verdict – 85% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and others. These techniques are used to undermine the credibility of Pope Francis and the interpretation of Amoris Laetitia, while promoting a particular viewpoint. The presence of these techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is propaganda, as it aims to persuade the audience by appealing to emotions and biases rather than presenting a balanced and objective analysis.**
