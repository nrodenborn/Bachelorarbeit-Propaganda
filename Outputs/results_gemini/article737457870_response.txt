1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses the mocking label ‘Calypso Louie’ to refer to Louis Farrakhan. It also uses the title "civil rights hero" sarcastically by adding "(TM)" to attack Rep. Clyburn.
2. Repetition – Yes – The central message that prominent Democrats have ties to Louis Farrakhan is repeated throughout the text by citing different individuals (Rep. Davis, Obama, Rep. Clyburn).
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in a slogan-like manner to encapsulate its message.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – By repeatedly linking Democratic politicians to Louis Farrakhan, a figure known for racist and antisemitic views, the text implicitly stokes fear that these politicians condone or share these dangerous ideologies.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on the sincerity of politicians' statements, for example, regarding Rep. Davis's condemnation of Farrakhan: ‘But we've seen that before. So it likely doesn't represent his views.’
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of the connections by framing them as a collapsing "embargo" and a major breakthrough, while minimizing the condemnations from the politicians as insincere or meaningless.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its case.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like ‘infamous Obama-Farrakhan photo,’ ‘harmful and divisive views,’ and the sarcastic ‘civil rights hero (TM)’ to shape the reader's perception.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The entire premise of the article is to discredit Democratic politicians by associating them with Louis Farrakhan, a figure widely condemned for antisemitism and racism, thus suggesting the politicians are tainted by this association.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests a growing trend of media outlets and journalists covering the story (‘The media's Farrakhan embargo is collapsing,’ mentioning CNN, WaPo, NYT), encouraging the reader to see this as an increasingly accepted and important issue.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the story gaining traction solely to ‘the hard work of committed conservative journalists,’ which is a simplified explanation for a complex media cycle.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is fairly direct in its accusations and points, rather than being deliberately unclear or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites journalists like Jake Tapper and Glenn Kessler, as well as outlets like the Daily Caller, as authorities to lend credibility to the importance of the story.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a binary choice: politicians must either completely condemn and disavow Farrakhan, or they are complicit. It dismisses any nuance or alternative explanation for their associations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase ‘But we've seen that before’ is used to dismiss a politician's statement without engaging with its content, discouraging any deeper consideration of its sincerity.
16. Red herring – Yes – The reference to Obama’s ‘Wright speech’ and the fabricated quote about his ‘dead white grandmother’ brings up a past controversy to further cast aspersions, distracting from the specific issue of the Farrakhan meeting.
17. Straw men – Yes – In response to an Obama spokeswoman stating he denounces Farrakhan’s views, the text retorts, ‘That fails to explain why he met with him.’ The spokeswoman was addressing his stance on the ideology, not defending the meeting, so the text refutes a point she wasn't making.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The final line, ‘We're starting to have that "national dialogue" about racism that the left keeps wanting us to have,’ is a form of whataboutism, accusing the ‘left’ of hypocrisy by turning the issue of racism back on them.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of specific Democratic politicians and the party as a whole. It achieves this by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. The piece selectively presents facts (like attending an event) but strips them of potential context, instead framing them in the most negative light possible using loaded language ("infamous"), name-calling ("Calypso Louie"), and sarcasm ("civil rights hero (TM)"). It heavily relies on casting doubt on any statement or action that contradicts its narrative, such as dismissing official condemnations as insincere. The entire argument is a form of Reduction ad Hitlerum, where association with a reviled figure (Farrakhan) is used to condemn the politicians. The use of logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy, whataboutism, and straw man arguments further demonstrates that the author's intent is to manipulate opinion rather than engage in honest debate. The combination of these techniques creates a one-sided, emotionally charged narrative designed to solidify a particular political viewpoint.
