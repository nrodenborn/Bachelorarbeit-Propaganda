1. Name calling – Yes – The headline labels the subjects as "New Mexico Jihadis," which is a loaded and insulting label intended to frame them negatively from the outset.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear by describing the group's alleged plan "to prepare for violent attacks on government, military, educational and financial institutions" and that children were being prepared "to engage in jihad and … to die as martyrs."
5. Doubt – Yes – The defense attorney's entire argument is built on creating doubt about the prosecution's motives, suggesting they "were motivated by a degree of racial and religious prejudice against his Muslim client."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The defense attorney's claim that if the suspects were white Christians, “No one would bat an eye” is an exaggeration, as the alleged crimes (planning attacks, malnourished children) would likely cause a reaction regardless of race or religion.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The defense attorney appeals to patriotism and American rights by stating, "there’s a Second Amendment right to own firearms in this country" and "we have freedom of religion in this country."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like "Jihadis," "violent attacks," "malnourished children living in squalid conditions," and "die as martyrs" to evoke a strong emotional response from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular or that "everyone" is doing it.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The defense attorney simplifies the complex reasons for the federal charges (conspiracy, firearms violations, discovery of malnourished children) down to a single alleged cause: racial and religious prejudice.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text, while biased, is direct in its claims and quotes. It does not use deliberately unclear language to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The line "Article posted with permission from Robert Spencer" is an appeal to the authority and credibility of Robert Spencer, a figure known for his specific views on Islam, to an audience that would recognize him.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The Editor's Note presents a false dichotomy: "If they were white, devout Christians, we wouldn't hear about this cause it would have never taken place because it would have gone against the teachings of Christ." This presents only two options (they are Muslims and did this / they are Christians and would never do this), ignoring all other possibilities.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any common clichés to shut down debate or critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll, "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?", is completely irrelevant to the article's topic and serves to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – Yes – The Editor's Note refutes an argument that wasn't made. The defense attorney's point is about how the justice system would *treat* white Christians in this situation. The Editor's Note refutes the different idea that white Christians would *commit* these acts in the first place, misrepresenting the original argument to easily knock it down.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The defense attorney deflects from the specific charges against his clients by changing the subject to a hypothetical situation: "What about if these were white Christians?" This is an attempt to charge the system with hypocrisy rather than address the evidence presented.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a neutral report of an event but a heavily framed opinion piece designed to manipulate the reader's perception. The piece begins with loaded **Name calling** ("Jihadis") and an "Editor's Note" that immediately employs a **Straw man** argument and a **Black & white fallacy** to dismiss the counter-argument before the reader even encounters it in the story. The article then uses **Appeal to fear** by detailing the group's alleged violent plans. The defense attorney's argument, which forms the core of the reported text, is itself a collection of propaganda techniques, including **Whataboutism**, **Causal Oversimplification**, and **Flag-Waving**. Furthermore, the inclusion of a completely unrelated and **Repetitive** poll serves as a blatant **Red herring** to distract the reader. The sheer density and variety of these techniques demonstrate a clear intent to push a specific narrative and emotional response rather than to inform objectively.
