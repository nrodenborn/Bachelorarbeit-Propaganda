Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Infidels" is used repeatedly as an insulting label for non-Muslims.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrase is used as a central rallying cry.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text repeatedly warns that ignoring Ramadan's "true nature" as a month of jihad leads to death for "Infidels" ("Meanwhile, it would be dangerous, suicidal folly...", "And as our Ramadan willful blindness continues, more Infidels will die.").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The text questions the credibility of President Trump's statement ("Trump was... severely misleading the American people") and Shadi Hamid's perspective ("What is actually offensive is that Hamid would try in this way...").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: Portraying Ramadan *universally* as "the month of jihad" and a "month of calamity everywhere for nonbelievers," implying all devout Muslims become "more severe against the unbelievers" during Ramadan. Minimization: Downplaying the diversity of Muslim practice and interpretations of Ramadan, reducing it solely to its potential connection to violence.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While the text defends "Infidels" and criticizes US leadership, it doesn't explicitly appeal to American patriotism or identity as a core technique.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Numerous emotionally charged words/phrases: "murdered," "plunderers," "calamity," "severe against disbelievers," "dangerous, suicidal folly," "willful blindness," "absolve... any responsibility," "root out jihad terrorist".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis or Hitler is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "Islam’s core beliefs make it clear that the latter statement is closer to the truth." implies a consensus among core Islamic beliefs supporting the author's view.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes the phenomenon of jihad attacks during Ramadan primarily and simplistically to the religious imperative of Ramadan itself ("Murdering infidels thus doesn’t contradict the spirit of Ramadan; it embodies it."), ignoring complex socio-political, economic, and individual factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The author's position and arguments are stated clearly, not obscured.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites the Quran (48:29) and the Kavkaz Center (a Chechen jihadist site) as authoritative sources supporting the claim that Ramadan is inherently linked to severity against disbelievers and jihad.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents only two starkly opposed interpretations of Ramadan: "a month of calamity everywhere for nonbelievers" (true) vs. a reminder of "the richness Muslims add" (misleading/false). Ignores other possible interpretations or nuances.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – The text engages in argument and citation, rather than shutting down thought with clichés.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The lengthy section critiquing Shadi Hamid's reaction to Trump's statement distracts from the core argument about Ramadan being the "month of jihad" and shifts focus to Muslim community responsibility and perceived offense.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Misrepresents Trump's (and Obama's/Bush's) statements about Ramadan recognizing Muslim contributions as *denying* or whitewashing the connection to jihad violence ("Trump was... severely misleading the American people" by claiming it adds richness, implying his statement contradicts the "truth" of Ramadan as jihad month).
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – When discussing Shadi Hamid's criticism of Trump's statement focusing on terrorism, the text deflects by charging Hamid/the Muslim community with hypocrisy regarding responsibility for rooting out terrorism ("What is actually offensive is that Hamid would try in this way to absolve the Muslim community of any responsibility...").

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It employs a wide array of propaganda techniques (Name-calling, Repetition, Appeal to fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Bandwagon, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to authority, Black & white fallacy, Red herring, Straw men, Whataboutism) to advance a specific, highly biased narrative: that Ramadan is inherently and primarily a month of divinely sanctioned violence against non-Muslims ("Infidels"), that Western leaders are deliberately misleading their populations about this, and that Muslims who disagree are evading responsibility. It selectively cites sources (Quran verse, jihadist site) to support this view while ignoring mainstream Islamic interpretations and the diversity of Muslim practice. Its primary purpose is not balanced information but to instill fear, promote a specific ideological viewpoint (Radical Islam as the "true" Islam), and discredit opposing perspectives through manipulative techniques rather than objective analysis. The inclusion of the poll repetition further underscores its intent to engage and potentially manipulate its audience. While it contains factual elements (reports of attacks, quotes), these are presented within a heavily distorted and manipulative framework designed to provoke a specific emotional and ideological response.
