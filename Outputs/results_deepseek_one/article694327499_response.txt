Below is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique, followed by a verdict on whether the text constitutes propaganda.  

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:  
1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Insults like "the Factory" (mocking Vatican communications), "What the Pope Really Means®" (mocking theologians), and "Bergoglian Mercy Train" (derogatory label for Pope Francis's agenda).  
2. **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: No deliberate repetition of a specific phrase to entrench an idea.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: Memorable phrases like "Bergoglian Mercy Train" and "What the Pope Really Means®" are used mockingly.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Warnings of "grave harm upon the Church," "ecclesial auto-demolition," and a "train wreck" instill fear about Pope Francis’s actions.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Questions credibility of Fastiggi, Goldstein ("linguistic tinkering"), Vatican translators ("ignorant"), and Pope Francis ("cunning ecclesiastical politician").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggerates implications of Latin text ("graver implications") and minimizes theologians' arguments ("worsen the problem").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to defend "Holy Mother Church," tradition, and "authentic Magisterium" against perceived threats.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Emotional terms like "outrageous proposition," "perniciousness," "train wreck," "false notion of mercy," and "shameful defense of the indefensible."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparison to Nazis/hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Explanation: References "rising opposition among the faithful" and signers of the "Correctio Filialis" to imply growing consensus against Pope Francis.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: No oversimplified cause-effect claims; arguments are detailed.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: Text is direct and critical, not vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Cites Church tradition, natural law, historical figures (Honorius I), and documents (e.g., *Familiaris consortio*) to legitimize criticism.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents Pope Francis as either orthodox or heretical ("worse than explicit heresy"), ignoring nuance.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Phrases like "No problem here!" and "Give. Me. A. Break." dismiss opposing views.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: Diverts to Cardinal Burke’s appointment, unrelated to the core theological debate.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: Misrepresents Fastiggi/Goldstein’s argument (e.g., claiming they endorse "objectively immoral behavior").  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: No false equivalences or hypocrisy charges.  

### Verdict:  
**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda due to its systematic use of persuasive techniques to delegitimize Pope Francis and his defenders. It employs **name-calling**, **loaded language**, and **fear appeals** to evoke outrage, while **misrepresenting opponents** (straw men), **oversimplifying moral arguments** (black & white fallacy), and **appealing to tradition** to rally readers against perceived threats to the Church. Though it presents theological arguments, its primary goal is persuasion through emotional manipulation, selective evidence, and ad hominem attacks—aligning with propaganda’s aim to influence rather than inform objectively. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges substantive critiques of *Amoris Laetitia*, but the tone and techniques dominate.
