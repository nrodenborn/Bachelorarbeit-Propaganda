Certainly! Here is the analysis of the text according to each propaganda technique, with examples and explanations as requested:

---

1. **Name calling** – No – There are no explicit insulting labels used against any person or group in the text.
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times in succession.
3. **Slogans** – No – There is no use of a brief and memorable phrase as a slogan in the text.
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear against any alternative or group.
5. **Doubt** – Yes – The text casts doubt on Acosta’s version of events: "Acosta has disputed the accusation claiming he never put his hands on the young woman." This is followed by a counter-narrative that suggests otherwise.
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The text exaggerates Acosta’s actions: "he used his hand to forcefully push the female interns arm away from the mic." The word "forcefully" is a strong exaggeration of what is widely considered a minor contact.
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Phrases like "forcefully push," "vicious attacks," and "rightfully losing his patients" are emotionally charged and intended to provoke a reaction.
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There is no comparison to Nazis or similarly reviled groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no explicit appeal to popularity or suggestion that "everyone" thinks a certain way.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text does not present a complex event as having a single simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is relatively clear about the events and claims.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites constitutional lawyer Floyd Mayweather (though likely a confusion with the boxer Floyd Mayweather, but presented as an authority) and Sam Donaldson, a respected journalist, to support claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The poll presents only a few options, with the "No" option phrased as "you can't act like a child and keep your pass," which frames the issue as a binary choice with loaded language.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – The poll option "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass" is a cliché that discourages further discussion or nuance.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main issue.
17. **Straw men** – Yes – The text misrepresents Acosta’s defense by stating "Acosta has disputed the accusation claiming he never put his hands on the young woman," then counters with an exaggerated version of events, rather than addressing his actual defense.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge an opponent with hypocrisy or deflect criticism by pointing to others' faults.

### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 80% –** The text exhibits several classic propaganda techniques, including repetition, loaded language, exaggeration, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, thought-terminating clichés, doubt, and straw man arguments. The narrative is constructed to frame Acosta negatively and justify the revocation of his press pass, with little room for nuance or alternative perspectives. The use of emotionally charged language, repetition of the poll question, and framing of choices in a biased manner all point to a high likelihood that the text is propagandistic in nature. However, it does not use every possible technique, and some factual reporting is present, so it is not pure propaganda, but the likelihood is high.
