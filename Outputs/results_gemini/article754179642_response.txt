1. Name calling – No – The text does not use any insulting labels to attack a person, group, or object.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief or memorable phrases to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – No – While the subject matter (Ebola) is frightening, the text reports facts about the disease's lethality and past outbreaks to inform, not to instill fear in support of a specific idea against an alternative.
5. Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or organization; on the contrary, it relies on official sources.

7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to describe the disease, such as in the phrase: "Ebola is one of the world's most notorious diseases, being both highly infectious and extremely lethal."

Verdict – 5% – The text is a factual news report, not a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the public about a public health emergency, not to promote a specific ideology or manipulate the audience's beliefs. While it technically uses two techniques, their application is consistent with standard journalistic practices rather than propagandistic intent. The 'Appeal to authority' is simply the journalistic standard of citing credible sources (the WHO, the DRC health ministry). The 'Loaded Language' ("notorious," "extremely lethal") can be seen as an accurate and descriptive, rather than manipulative, way to convey the severity of the Ebola virus. The overwhelming absence of the other 16 propaganda techniques confirms that this is an informational news article.
