**Verdict – 80% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, reduction ad Hitlerum, causal oversimplification, black & white fallacy, and red herring. These techniques are used to shape the reader's perception of the events and to promote a specific narrative that questions the competence of authorities and paints a negative picture of Muslims. The frequent use of emotionally charged language and repetition of specific phrases further suggests a high likelihood of the text being propaganda.**
