Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the given text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "illegals" is used repeatedly as an insulting label for undocumented immigrants. Example: "Often, by putting **illegals** into the system...", "That system would require more judges to handle more **illegals**..."
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "We want strong borders and we want no crime" and "We want a system where when people come in illegally, they have to go out" serve as brief, memorable phrases promoting Trump's position.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Links Democrats to "open borders" and claims they "don’t care about crime," instilling fear about crime and border security. Also, framing the judicial process as costing "the American people lots of money" and being "worthless" uses fear of financial waste.
5.  **Doubt – No** – No direct questioning of the credibility of a specific person or institution beyond the generalized criticism of Democrats and the judicial process.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Minimizes the complexity of immigration enforcement by calling the current system "horrible," "obsolete," and a "worthless judicial process." Exaggerates the simplicity and effectiveness of simply walking people back ("make sure they keep walking").
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Appeals to patriotism and national interest by mentioning costs to "the American people," "America's tax dollars," and the need for border "security."
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Uses emotionally charged terms like "illegals," "worthless judicial process," "more amnesty," "don’t care about crime," "begs the question if any of them take the law seriously," and "open borders" to evoke negative emotions and stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparison to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – No appeal to the popularity of the idea ("everyone agrees," "most people want").
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Attributes the complex issue of immigration delays and costs primarily or solely to "obsolete" and "horrible" laws, suggesting fixing these laws is the simple solution ("sure up things").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is relatively direct in its criticism and proposals, though terms like "sure up things" and "the system" are somewhat vague but not deliberately obscure enough to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – Trump is stating his own views and proposals; no external authority figure is cited to bolster the claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents only two starkly opposed options: Trump's plan ("strong borders," "no crime") vs. the Democrats' alleged position ("open borders," "don’t care about crime"). Example: "“We want strong borders and we want no crime,” Trump said. “The Democrats want open borders and they don’t care about crime.”"
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" or "that's just common sense" used explicitly to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – The poll asking "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" and listing Democratic politicians is irrelevant to the article's main topic of Trump's immigration plan, serving as a distraction.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Misrepresents the Democratic position on immigration as "want[ing] open borders" and "don’t care about crime," which is an extreme characterization not representative of mainstream Democratic policy proposals.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – Does not charge opponents with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions or inconsistencies on this specific issue within the text.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on **Name Calling** ("illegals"), **Loaded Language**, **Appeal to Fear**, **Flag-Waving**, **Black & White Fallacy**, and **Straw Men** to promote President Trump's immigration stance and attack opponents. The inclusion of a **Red Herring** poll further distracts and fuels partisan sentiment. While it reports on Trump's statements and contains some factual elements (e.g., describing his proposal and criticism of the judicial process), the overall presentation is designed to persuade through emotional manipulation, oversimplification, demonization of the opposition ("open borders," "don't care about crime"), and dehumanization of undocumented immigrants ("illegals," "make sure they keep walking"). The source ("Sons Of Liberty Media") and the framing strongly indicate an intent to promote a specific partisan agenda rather than provide neutral information. The consistent use of multiple definitive propaganda techniques makes it highly likely to be propaganda.
