Here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "disgrace" (referring to Kavanaugh hearings), "Open Borders Bill" (implies extremism).
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan..." is repeated verbatim three times.
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, standalone memorable phrases beyond Trump's quotes.
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "If you don’t want to be saying the words ‘Speaker Pelosi’... you gotta go out and vote" uses fear of Democratic control to motivate voting.
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "The people of Indiana do not have a one-week memory" questions Donnelly's credibility/sincerity.
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – No clear instances of inflating or downplaying facts beyond typical rhetoric.
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No explicit appeals to patriotism or national identity.
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "disgrace," "attacks on conservatives," "outrage," "sponsored... 'Open Borders Bill'" use emotionally charged or stereotyping terms.
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No linkage to hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No explicit appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone is doing this").
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Implies voting Republican is the *only* way to avoid "Speaker Pelosi," ignoring other factors influencing House control.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are direct, not deliberately confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Relies on Trump's statements as evidence (e.g., praising Braun, criticizing Donnelly).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents voting Republican as the *only* alternative to Democratic control ("If you don’t want Pelosi... vote [Republican]").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" used to shut down debate.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The migrant caravan poll distracts from the main topic (election outcomes) with an unrelated issue.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Criticisms of Donnelly (tax cuts, Kavanaugh vote) reference actual votes, not misrepresented positions.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy against opponents.

**Verdict – 95% –**  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It leverages **fear** ("Speaker Pelosi"), **doubt** (Donnelly's memory), **loaded language** ("disgrace," "outrage"), and **causal oversimplification** (voting Republican as the sole solution). The **repeated poll** and **red herring** (migrant caravan) distract from policy discussions, while **black-and-white framing** eliminates nuance. Though not *every* technique is used, the core message relies on emotional manipulation, distortion of stakes, and diversionary tactics to promote a partisan agenda. The author’s explicit endorsement ("everyone should [vote against Democrats]") and inflammatory framing confirm its intent to persuade, not inform. The 5% uncertainty accounts for factual elements (e.g., Donnelly’s voting record), but these are embedded in a manipulative narrative.
