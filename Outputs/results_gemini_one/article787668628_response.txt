1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Christine Ford as a "far-left Democrat operative" to attack her character and motives rather than addressing the substance of her claim on its own terms.
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat a specific phrase or message in the style of a mantra.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as a rallying cry.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states that Democrats have "nefarious goals of stopping the President from strengthening America and protecting Americans," which instills fear about the consequences of the Democrats succeeding.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire piece is constructed to cast doubt on the accuser's credibility. An example is: "An unprovable accusation from decades ago that the accuser said nothing about until years later, and that is uncorroborated by any other testimony..."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by stating, "This is clearly a set-up," presenting a complex situation as a simple, definitive conspiracy. It also minimizes the allegation by framing it as merely an "unprovable accusation."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the opposition to Kavanaugh as an attempt at "...stopping the President from strengthening America and protecting Americans."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "nefarious goals" to characterize the opposition and influence the reader's emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex event by stating, "This is clearly a set-up (Christine Ford is also a far-left Democrat operative) designed to derail the nomination of a good man."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its arguments, not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses David French, the *National Review*, and his status as a "former trial lawyer" as authorities to lend credibility to its argument. Example: "As a former trial lawyer, I can tell you that while neither notes nor memories are infallible..."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The headline presents a false dichotomy: "Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros." This suggests the only two options are to believe all women or to be a hypocrite, ignoring nuances.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; it actively makes an argument.
16. Red herring – Yes – The headline and its focus on Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken, and George Soros is a red herring. It distracts from the specific allegations against Brett Kavanaugh by shifting the focus to the alleged hypocrisy of Democrats.
17. Straw men – Yes – The headline, "Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women," misrepresents the argument of Kavanaugh's opponents. The argument was generally for a thorough investigation of a serious claim, not for automatic belief without evidence, which is an easier position to attack.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The headline is a clear example of whataboutism. In response to a claim against a Republican nominee, it immediately deflects by asking, "what about" the alleged actions of various Democrats.

***

Verdict – 90% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. The introductory section, before the quoted article, employs a high concentration of propaganda techniques. It uses a straw man argument ("Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women"), whataboutism and red herrings (by bringing up Clinton, Ellison, etc.), name-calling ("far-left Democrat operative"), loaded language ("nefarious goals"), and appeals to fear and patriotism. This initial framing is designed to emotionally prime the reader and discredit the opposition before any evidence is presented.

The text then uses an appeal to authority by presenting a long excerpt from a *National Review* article by a "former trial lawyer." While this quoted section is more analytical in tone, its function within the larger text is to provide a veneer of reasoned, legalistic legitimacy to the highly partisan and emotional claims made in the introduction. The overall goal is not to foster a nuanced understanding but to solidify a particular viewpoint by attacking the motives and character of the opposition while selectively analyzing evidence to support a predetermined conclusion.
