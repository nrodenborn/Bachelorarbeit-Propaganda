Verdict – 40% – The text exhibits some characteristics of propaganda, such as repetition, exaggeration, loaded language, and appeal to authority. However, it lacks many other propaganda techniques that would make it more likely to be classified as propaganda. The use of emotionally charged language and repeated phrases suggests an attempt to influence the audience's perception of the situation, but the presence of factual reporting and references to authoritative sources provides a balanced view. Therefore, while there are elements of propaganda, the likelihood of the text being propaganda is moderate.
