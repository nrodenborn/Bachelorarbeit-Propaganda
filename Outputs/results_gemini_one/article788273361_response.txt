1. Name calling – No – The text criticizes the Democratic Party for hypocrisy but does not attack them with a specific insulting label.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – No – The text references the slogan "believe women" but attributes it to Democrats to highlight their alleged hypocrisy, rather than using a slogan to promote its own message.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The article aims to generate anger and outrage at perceived hypocrisy, not to instill fear in the audience.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text is constructed to cast doubt on the credibility and sincerity of the Democratic Party. The line, "Democrats, they do pick their “victims” well, don’t they?" directly questions their motives.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – While the framing is biased, the text does not contain a clear and overt example of exaggerating or minimizing a specific fact or figure.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The article's conflict is framed around political parties (Democrats vs. Republicans/conservatives), not an appeal to national pride or patriotism.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged language to influence the reader. For example: "I’ve been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party." and the sarcastic, leading question, "Democrats, they do pick their “victims” well, don’t they?"
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text makes no comparisons to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is good because it is popular. In fact, it highlights a case where someone is allegedly being ignored by a popular movement.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The article does not attempt to explain a complex event with a single simple cause.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article's point is direct and clear: to accuse the Democratic Party of hypocrisy.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article heavily relies on the testimony of Karen Monahan, presenting her as the primary authority and evidence for its claims. It also cites Fox News and Peter Daou, a "Democratic strategist," to build its case.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present the reader with a false dichotomy or only two choices.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The article does not use clichés to shut down debate; it seeks to provoke a particular line of thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll, "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?", is inserted into the middle of the article and is completely irrelevant to the story about Keith Ellison and Karen Monahan, serving as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The article frames the Democratic position as an absolute, unconditional "believe women." It then attacks this simplified position (the straw man) by showing an instance where they allegedly don't, ignoring any potential nuance in the actual stance (e.g., "all claims should be taken seriously").
18. Whataboutism – Yes – This is the central technique of the article. The entire piece is structured to counter the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh by changing the subject to the accusations against Keith Ellison, thereby charging the Democratic Party with hypocrisy. The core message is, "You are upset about Kavanaugh, but what about Ellison?"

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to objectively inform the reader but to persuade them of a political viewpoint by attacking the credibility of an opposing group. The article is built around a textbook "Whataboutism" framework, deflecting from the issue of Brett Kavanaugh by accusing the Democratic Party of hypocrisy regarding Keith Ellison. It employs several other techniques to achieve this goal, including creating a "Straw Man" of the "believe women" movement to make it easier to attack, using "Loaded Language" and rhetorical questions to "Doubt" the motives of Democrats, and inserting a "Red Herring" poll to distract the reader. The selective use of sources and quotes serves a one-sided narrative, confirming its nature as persuasive propaganda rather than balanced journalism.
