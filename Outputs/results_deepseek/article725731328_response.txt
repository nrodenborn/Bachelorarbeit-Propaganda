### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Use of Techniques**: 12/18 propaganda methods are deployed, including inflammatory name-calling, fear appeals, and oversimplification.  
2. **Decontextualized Aggregation**: Farrakhan’s extreme quotes (spanning decades) are presented without context to imply Obama’s guilt by association.  
3. **Conspiracy Framing**: Alleges a 10-year media/Islamist cover-up without verifiable evidence, relying on insinuation (e.g., "conspired with the terror group").  
4. **Source Bias**: Pamela Geller (noted anti-Islam activist) amplifies unproven claims, while dismissing mainstream media as dishonest "enemedia."  
5. **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded terms ("jihad," "war on America") stoke fear, while Reduction ad Hitlerum exploits historical trauma.  
6. **Political Agenda**: Aims to delegitimize Obama’s presidency by linking him to extremists, implying he is anti-American.  

**Why not 100%?**  
The photo’s existence is factual (per TPM reporting), but its significance is exaggerated. The text uses this fact to construct a false narrative of conspiracy and imminent threat, hallmarks of propaganda. The overwhelming use of manipulative techniques confirms its propagandistic intent.
