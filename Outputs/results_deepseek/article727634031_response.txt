Based on the definitions provided and the text analysis, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation:* The text uses neutral or factual labels ("ammo seller," "aerospace engineer," "person of interest"). No insulting labels are applied to Haig or Paddock (e.g., "monster," "terrorist").  

2. **Repetition** – No  
   *Explanation:* Key facts (e.g., the shooting’s death toll, Haig’s arrest) are stated once or contextually revisited, but not repetitively hammered to manipulate perception.  

3. **Slogans** – No  
   *Explanation:* No brief, memorable phrases are used to simplify or rally support (e.g., "Justice now!" or "Ban armor-piercing bullets!").  

4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
   *Explanation:* The horrific details of the shooting (e.g., "killing 58 people") are reported factually, not used to instill fear against alternatives (e.g., gun ownership).  

5. **Doubt** – No  
   *Explanation:* The text presents evidence (e.g., fingerprints, Haig’s admission) neutrally. It does not rhetorically question Haig’s credibility beyond citing official allegations.  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No  
   *Explanation:* Statistics (e.g., death toll) and claims (e.g., Haig’s role) are reported without embellishment or downplaying. Haig minimizes his involvement ("no contribution"), but this is attributed to him, not the author.  

7. **Flag-Waving** – No  
   *Explanation:* No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty (e.g., "True Americans support gun control").  

8. **Loaded Language** – No  
   *Explanation:* Language is largely neutral and descriptive. Emotional terms like "massacre" or "horror" are contextual and attributed to sources (e.g., Haig’s reaction: "Revulsion. Sickness. Horror").  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *Explanation:* No attempts to discredit ideas or actions by linking them to hated groups (e.g., "This is what Nazis do!").  

10. **Bandwagon** – No  
    *Explanation:* No appeals to popularity (e.g., "Everyone agrees Haig is guilty").  

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No  
    *Explanation:* The text avoids attributing the shooting to a single cause. It notes Haig’s ammunition sales but emphasizes investigators found "no evidence" tracer rounds were used and that Haig was unaware of Paddock’s plans.  

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No  
    *Explanation:* Details are specific (e.g., bullet types, timelines). Ambiguities (e.g., whether incendiary rounds were fired) are acknowledged as unresolved, not obscured.  

13. **Appeal to authority** – No  
    *Explanation:* Authorities (FBI, police) are cited as sources of facts, but their statements are not used as unquestionable proof to endorse a broader agenda.  

14. **Black & white fallacy** – No  
    *Explanation:* No false dichotomies (e.g., "Either ban all ammo sales or accept more massacres"). Complexities (e.g., Haig’s ignorance of Paddock’s intent) are included.  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No  
    *Explanation:* No phrases that shut down debate (e.g., "It’s common sense that Haig is complicit"). Critical details (e.g., legal processes) are explored.  

16. **Red herring** – No  
    *Explanation:* The text stays focused on Haig’s case and the shooting. Captions under photos describe the event but do not introduce irrelevant material.  

17. **Straw men** – No  
    *Explanation:* No misrepresented arguments are refuted. Haig’s defense is presented directly ("no contribution to what Paddock did").  

18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    *Explanation:* No accusations of hypocrisy to deflect criticism (e.g., "What about other ammo sellers?").  

---

**Verdict – 5% –**  
The text is a factual news report, not propaganda. It neutrally presents:  
- **Evidence-based allegations** against Haig (e.g., fingerprints, lack of license).  
- **Haig’s defense** (e.g., unaware of Paddock’s plans, "no contribution" to the attack).  
- **Contextual details** (e.g., shooting timeline, legal procedures) without manipulative framing.  
While the subject is emotionally charged, the language avoids loaded rhetoric, exaggeration, or persuasive techniques. The 5% allowance reflects inherent subjectivity in reporting traumatic events but does not indicate systematic propaganda.
