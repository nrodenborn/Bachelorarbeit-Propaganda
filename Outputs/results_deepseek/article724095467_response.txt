Based on the definitions provided and the text "PROOF: The LVMPD And FBI Failed To Catalog At Least One Deceased Las Vegas Massacre Victim As Death Toll Rises", here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "gross negligence", "massive cover-up", "completely botched investigation and cover-up". These are insulting labels applied to the LVMPD and FBI investigation.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The question "Who was this victim?" is repeated twice. The core claim of an uncatalogued victim is repeated throughout.
3.  **Slogans** – No – The text uses a headline and descriptive phrases ("gross negligence", "massive cover-up"), but no distinct, brief, memorable slogan is used.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text implies a sinister cover-up by authorities ("massive cover-up of the truth", "completely botched investigation and cover-up"), instilling fear that the government is hiding crucial information about a tragedy.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The text consistently questions the credibility of the LVMPD and FBI investigation ("failed to catalogue", "gross negligence or a massive cover-up", "FBI never asked for tape", "How was this victim overlooked?", "Will the F.B.I. and LVMPD please explain what in the Hell is going on here?").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes (Exaggeration) – Using terms like "gross negligence", "massive cover-up", "completely botched", and "astonishingly" amplifies the perceived failures. The implication that a hovering helicopter is definitively linked to the debris (without conclusive proof it caused it or was sinister) is also exaggerated.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national/group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Numerous emotionally charged words and phrases are used: "gross negligence", "massive cover-up", "completely botched", "lifeless body", "drug across", "astonishingly", "what in the Hell", "ignored by investigators". These appeal to outrage and suspicion.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – The text does not attempt to link the authorities' actions to groups hated by the audience (e.g., Nazis).
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of the idea that there was a cover-up.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text strongly implies that the observed debris movement is definitively caused by a hovering helicopter ("downdraft, prop wash, possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer") and uses this as key evidence of something suspicious or part of a cover-up, without adequately considering other potential causes or providing conclusive proof for this specific cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – While the text raises questions, its accusations and descriptions are relatively direct and specific, not deliberately obscure or vague. It points to specific times, locations, and evidence (even if interpreted tendentiously).
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites Tucker Carlson and his reporting on the footage ("Tucker Carlson said", "Carlson claims") to bolster its claims about the victim and the helicopter.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text frames the situation as either "gross negligence or a massive cover-up", presenting only these two extreme negative options for why the victim might not be catalogued, ignoring potential other explanations (e.g., complex investigation errors, miscommunication, definitional issues).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – While the text uses loaded language, it doesn't employ simplistic phrases specifically designed to shut down critical thought (e.g., "It is what it is", "Just common sense").
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The detail about "several men, one of which presumably was Fox News anchor Sean Hannity... received mobile haircuts in the very same parking lot" is irrelevant to the core claim of an uncatalogued victim or the helicopter debris. It serves to distract and imply further strange or suspicious behavior at the scene.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text criticizes the LVMPD/FBI based on their reported actions (failing to catalogue the victim, not requesting the tape) and the evidence presented. It doesn't refute an argument they didn't make.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge the LVMPD/FBI with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated wrongs they or others committed.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is to persuade the reader that the LVMPD and FBI are engaged in a deliberate cover-up ("gross negligence or a massive cover-up") regarding the Las Vegas shooting, specifically the death toll. This is achieved through:
*   **Heavy Use of Loaded Language & Name-Calling:** Terms like "gross negligence," "massive cover-up," "completely botched," and "astonishingly" frame the narrative negatively from the start and throughout.
*   **Appeal to Fear & Doubt:** It directly aims to instill fear and deep suspicion about the official investigation and authorities' motives.
*   **Repetition:** Key claims (uncatalogued victim) and questions ("Who was this victim?") are repeated for emphasis.
*   **Causal Oversimplification & Exaggeration:** It strongly implies a sinister cause for debris (a hovering helicopter) connected to the cover-up, without sufficient proof, and exaggerates the significance and certainty of this observation.
*   **Black & White Fallacy:** It presents only extreme negative explanations for the missing victim record.
*   **Red Herring:** It includes irrelevant, distracting details (haircuts) to foster a sense of strangeness and impropriety.
*   **Appeal to Authority:** It leverages Tucker Carlson's reporting to lend credibility.
While the text references specific evidence (the footage, the report map, flight records), the interpretation of this evidence is presented in a highly biased, emotionally charged manner designed to support the predetermined conclusion of a cover-up. The overwhelming use of persuasive techniques over balanced, objective reporting strongly indicates propaganda. The 15% margin acknowledges the presence of cited factual elements (times, locations, report excerpts) even if their interpretation and framing are propagandistic.
