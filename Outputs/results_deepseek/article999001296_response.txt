Below is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "pro-jihad Marxist Democrat" (insulting label), "insane in their lust for power" (attack on Democrats).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used to summarize the message.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "will destroy even our democratic system to get [power]" instills fear about Democrats' actions.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Republicans have pointed to embattled Broward Elections chief Brenda Snipes’ record... perhaps fraudulently so" questions election credibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "massive scale" (exaggeration of voter fraud), "already over" (minimizes Arizona election complexity).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "insane," "lust for power," "destroy," "fraudulently," "embattled" (emotionally charged words).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis or hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeals to popularity or peer pressure.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes election issues solely to Democratic fraud, ignoring other factors (e.g., administrative errors).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text cites specific events/counties (e.g., Broward, dates) without deliberate vagueness.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites "federal prosecutors," "Department of State," and officials (e.g., McVay) to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Frames Democrats as universally corrupt ("working feverishly to overturn the will of the people") versus Republicans as defenders of democracy.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "end of discussion" or simplistic slogans halting debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – The poll about Jim Acosta is unrelated but presented as a separate element; it does not distract from the election narrative.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy against critics.  

---

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely propaganda due to multiple techniques distorting the narrative. The opening commentary uses inflammatory language (name-calling, loaded terms), exaggeration ("massive scale"), fear-mongering ("destroy our democratic system"), and oversimplification (blaming Democrats alone). While the article section cites factual details (e.g., altered documents), it selectively emphasizes Democratic ties and downplays counter-evidence (e.g., state monitors seeing "no fraud"). The repetitive poll and framing of Democrats as universally malicious further signal intent to manipulate opinion rather than inform neutrally. However, the inclusion of sourced reporting (e.g., Politico) and specific allegations prevents a 100% rating.
