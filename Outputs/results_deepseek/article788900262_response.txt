Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "political lynch mob" (Labels those opposing Kavanaugh as an irrational, violent mob out for blood).
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans – No** – No brief, memorable phrase is used repeatedly as a slogan for the core argument.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – The headline "If Kavanaugh Is Not Confirmed By Senate, Then We Are All Just One Accusation Away From Ruin" and the overall framing suggest that failure to confirm Kavanaugh based on Ford's accusation sets a dangerous precedent where anyone can be destroyed by an unsubstantiated claim.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – Repeatedly questions Ford's credibility and memory: "If this had been such a pivotal moment for her, how could she have forgotten any those facts?", "Most victims of sexual assault remember every detail", "possibly because she doesn’t want to perjure herself", "36 years can distort memories".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Minimization: Downplays the alleged assault by suggesting it might only have been "Kavanaugh may have made a pass at her", "a much milder version", "Ford said no and that was it", "they did not have sex, nor was this a hostage situation". Exaggeration: The headline's "We Are All Just One Accusation Away From Ruin" exaggerates the potential consequence.
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – While concepts like "due process" and "equal justice under the law" are mentioned, there is no explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity as a core argument technique.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Uses emotionally charged or prejudicial terms: "smeared", "political lynch mob", "destroy a man's life", "zealous to the point where they've lost their common sense", "scatter like mice", "call all the shots", "highly partisan, activist attorney".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No attempt is made to link support for Ford or Democrats to groups hated by the audience (e.g., Nazis).
10. **Bandwagon – No** – While citing commentators (Shapiro, Pirro, Jarrett, Limbaugh) is an appeal to authority, the text does not primarily argue that the *position itself* is popular and therefore should be adopted.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Attributes the accusation and timing solely to a Democratic political strategy: "Democrats want to delay this vote until after the midterms because they believe they have a chance to retake the Senate as well as the House", "Dianne Feinstein chose to sit on it until the moment it could inflict maximum political damage". This ignores other potential complexities or motivations.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The arguments are presented clearly, even if biased. No deliberate obscurity is evident.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Cites Ben Shapiro ("you have to have some evidence before you destroy a man's life"), Jeanine Pirro (on believing women based on party), Gregg Jarrett ("zealous to the point where they've lost their common sense"), and Rush Limbaugh (on Senate accommodating accuser) to support the argument.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents Ford's testimony as either completely fabricated/insignificant ("Either this did not happen at all or a much milder version") or sufficient to destroy Kavanaugh, ignoring nuances of memory, trauma, or degrees of misconduct. Also presents the political reaction as purely partisan belief/disbelief ("you believe any woman who goes against a Republican and you don't believe any woman who goes against a Democrat").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Uses phrases like "political lynch mob" and "destroy a man's life" to evoke strong emotion and shut down critical analysis of the allegations or process.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – Introduces the irrelevant poll question about Nikki Haley's UN replacement multiple times. Also, the focus on Dianne Feinstein's timing ("Dianne Feinstein chose to sit on it") distracts from the substance of the allegation itself.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Attributes positions to opponents that are not fairly represented: Implies Democrats/opponents automatically believe Ford solely because she accused a Republican and would disregard due process ("you believe any woman who goes against a Republican", "Why are people willing to throw out due process, equal justice under the law and the presumption of innocence?"). This misrepresents the arguments for a thorough investigation.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The text does not charge opponents with hypocrisy by pointing to similar behavior on their side in different situations.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a significant number of recognized propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating clichés, Red Herring, Straw Men) to advance a highly partisan narrative. Its primary purpose is not balanced analysis but to discredit Christine Blasey Ford and her allegations, attack Democrats and their motives, portray Brett Kavanaugh as an unquestionably qualified victim of a political smear, and instill fear about the consequences of his non-confirmation. While it contains some factual elements (e.g., Grassley's actions, Ford's attorney's requests), these are heavily framed and surrounded by manipulative techniques designed to persuade the reader to a specific conclusion and evoke strong emotional reactions against the opposing side. The pervasive use of loaded language, minimization of the accusation, casting of doubt on the accuser, and oversimplified attribution of motive are hallmarks of propaganda.
