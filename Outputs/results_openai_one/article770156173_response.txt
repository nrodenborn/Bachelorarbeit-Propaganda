**Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, black & white fallacy, red herring, and whataboutism. These elements suggest a strong likelihood that the text is intended to influence the reader's perception of the North Korea situation and the involved political figures. However, it does not employ all the listed propaganda techniques, and some arguments are presented with supporting details, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood of it being pure propaganda.**
