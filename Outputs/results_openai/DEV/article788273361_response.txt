Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including repetition, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, black & white fallacy, and whataboutism. These techniques suggest a significant likelihood of the text being propaganda, as they aim to influence the audience’s perception of the Democratic Party’s handling of the allegations against Keith Ellison compared to Brett Kavanaugh. The use of emotionally charged language and the emphasis on perceived hypocrisy are indicative of an attempt to sway opinion rather than present a balanced account.
