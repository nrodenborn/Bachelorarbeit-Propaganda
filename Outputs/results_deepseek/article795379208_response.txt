### Verdict – 15% –   
The text is **not propaganda** but **documentation of propaganda techniques** used by U.S. officials. The article reports statements by Pompeo and Trump that employ minimization, obfuscation, red herrings, and appeals to fear/authority to deflect Saudi accountability. However, the article itself maintains journalistic balance:  
- It cites Turkish evidence of torture/murder.  
- Notes Saudi denials shifted from ignorance to "rogue killers."  
- Quotes critics questioning Saudi credibility.  
- Highlights contradictions (e.g., Trump’s "severe punishment" vs. "guilty until proven innocent").  
The *Los Angeles Times* frames these events critically, exposing administration tactics without endorsing them. Propaganda techniques are present in the *quoted statements* (Pompeo/Trump), but the article functions as investigative reporting, not advocacy. The 15% likelihood reflects embedded propaganda in official quotes, not the article’s intent.
