Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against opponents or the subject matter. The NRA is mentioned neutrally as "NRA priorities".
2.  **Repetition** – No – Key phrases like "gun control" or "save lives" appear multiple times naturally in the reporting, but there is no deliberate, excessive repetition of the *same* core message phrase.
3.  **Slogans** – No – While phrases like "common-sense, life-saving laws" and "keep our communities safe" are used, they are descriptive statements within quotes or the narrative, not presented as standalone, brief, memorable rallying cries like "BUILD THE WALL".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Phrases like "live free of the fear of being gunned down" and references to the Parkland shooting as "impetus" evoke fear of gun violence to support the resolutions. "America’s gun violence crisis" also frames the issue in fearful terms.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of opponents or alternative viewpoints. It presents the Conference's position positively.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The claims made (e.g., "save lives", "crisis") are strong advocacy positions but not clear factual exaggerations or minimizations within the context of the debate. The description of the Conference's history and actions appears factual.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no overt appeal to patriotism, national identity, or "our way of life". References are to "communities" and "public safety", not national symbols or identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words and phrases like "gunned down", "crisis", and "fear" carry strong negative emotional connotations regarding gun violence. "Common-sense" frames the proposed laws positively while implying opponents lack sense.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison is made to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally despised groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text mentions the Conference's actions and Everytown's support, but it doesn't explicitly argue that the policies are correct *because* they are popular or gaining support. It focuses on the group's stance and rationale.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text cites the Parkland shooting and the general "crisis" as motivation, but it does not claim these resolutions are a simple or sole solution to the complex problem of gun violence. It presents them as specific measures.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The resolutions and positions are described relatively clearly: background checks, red flag laws, banning assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, opposing arming teachers. Terms like "common-sense" are vague but common in political discourse and not used here to deliberately obscure meaning.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text repeatedly cites the authority of the U.S. Conference of Mayors ("The bipartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors passed...", "The group said...", "The U.S. Conference of Mayors will continue...") and quotes its chair (Karen Freeman-Wilson) and an advocate (John Feinblatt) to support the stance on gun control.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents the Conference's preferred policies but does not frame the issue as only having two extreme choices (e.g., "either pass these laws or let children be gunned down"). While advocating for their position, it doesn't explicitly eliminate other possibilities.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – The phrase "common-sense, life-saving laws" (used by Feinblatt) functions as a thought-terminating cliché. It frames the proposed laws as inherently obvious and beneficial, potentially discouraging critical examination of their specifics, effectiveness, or potential drawbacks by dismissing opposition as lacking "common sense".
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the resolutions passed, the reasons given (reducing gun violence, safety), and the reactions. It does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text reports the Conference's positions and supportive statements. It does not attribute a weak or false argument to gun rights advocates and then refute that instead of their actual arguments. The mention of "NRA priorities" is brief and not elaborated into a refutation of a misrepresented stance.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge opponents (like the NRA or lawmakers) with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated issues or past actions to deflect criticism.

**Verdict – 25% –** The text exhibits elements of propaganda, primarily through **Appeal to fear** ("fear of being gunned down", "crisis"), **Loaded language** ("gunned down", "crisis", "common-sense"), **Appeal to authority** (relying on the Conference's standing), and **Thought-terminating clichés** ("common-sense"). These techniques are used to persuasively advocate for the gun control resolutions. However, the core of the text functions as a **news report**. It factually relays the event (resolutions passed), summarizes the content of the resolutions, provides direct quotes from involved officials and supporters, and states the motivating incidents (Parkland). It presents a specific viewpoint (pro-gun control) positively but does so primarily by reporting the statements and actions of an organization, rather than employing a majority of the overtly manipulative techniques listed (like Name-Calling, Doubt, Exaggeration, Flag-Waving, Hitler comparisons, Bandwagon appeals, Black/White fallacies, Red Herrings, Straw Men, or Whataboutism). The propaganda elements are present in the *framing* and *language choices* of the advocates quoted and the article itself, but the underlying structure is informational reporting.
