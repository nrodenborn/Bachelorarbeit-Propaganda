### Verdict – 95% –  
**Explanation:**  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs **11 of 18 techniques** (e.g., name-calling, fear appeals, loaded language, reduction ad Hitlerum) to manipulate emotion and polarize readers. Core strategies include:  
- **Demonization:** Labels opponents (Trump, Democrats) as "extremists," "Stalinist," or "Naziesque."  
- **Fearmongering:** Predicts violence, tyranny, and divine judgment to oppose gun laws.  
- **Moral absolutism:** Frames gun ownership as a biblical duty and compliance as "sinful."  
- **Selective evidence:** Cites Kobach’s legal analysis while ignoring counterarguments about public safety.  
- **Emotional language:** Uses terms like "tyrannical," "OUTRAGED," and "war" to incite anger.  
Though it references factual events (e.g., Trump’s quotes, state laws), these are embedded in a narrative designed to provoke visceral opposition rather than encourage critical discussion. The call to action ("NO Christian should ever comply") and religious/moral framing further cement its role as persuasive propaganda advancing a specific ideological agenda.
