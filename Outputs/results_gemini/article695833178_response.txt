1. Name calling – Yes – The text directly attacks authorities by labeling them as liars. The explanation is in the example: "proves that authorities have directly lied to the American people".

2. Repetition – Yes – The central message that authorities are lying and hiding information is repeated throughout the text. For example, it starts with "Authorities LIED," states the "FBI specifically lied," and concludes that their "entire narrative" is questionable and one must wonder "what else is being hidden."

3. Slogans – Yes – The question in the headline, "What Else Are They Hiding?", serves as a brief, memorable phrase that encapsulates the article's entire premise and encourages a specific mindset.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear and distrust in official institutions by suggesting a massive, deliberate cover-up related to a national tragedy, implying a hidden and potentially dangerous truth. The question "What Else Are They Hiding?" is a direct appeal to this fear.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire purpose of the article is to cast doubt on the official investigation and the credibility of law enforcement. The line, "This throws their entire narrative into question," is a clear example.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of a discrepancy in a check-in date, presenting it as definitive proof that the entire official story is a lie. For example: "This throws their entire narrative into question".

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text makes a subtle appeal to patriotism by framing the issue as a betrayal of the nation as a whole. The example is: "authorities have directly lied to the American people".

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to sway the reader's opinion. Examples include "LIED," "Hiding," "Shockingly," "horrific shooting," and "disinformation."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text implies that a large and growing movement is questioning the official story by stating, "the alternative media has spent countless hours conducting their own investigations" and that "many different theories have been put forth."

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex conclusion: a discrepancy in a check-in date is presented as the sole proof of a massive, intentional government conspiracy, ignoring other possibilities like a simple error in a fluid investigation.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text vaguely alludes to other evidence to create suspicion without providing concrete details for the reader to scrutinize. For example: "From reports of multiple shooters to officials seemingly covering up the ISIS connection, many different theories have been put forth".

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses an "investigative reporter" (Laura Loomer) and the "alternative media" as counter-authorities to lend credibility to its claims against official sources.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either you accept the official narrative, which it frames as a complete lie, or you believe the alternative theories. It states, "every piece of so-called evidence put forth by authorities... cannot be trusted and should be considered as disinformation until proven otherwise."

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The headline question, "What Else Are They Hiding?", is designed not to be answered thoughtfully but to end discussion and reinforce the idea that authorities are untrustworthy.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces topics like "the ISIS connection" and the "bizarre interviews" with the shooter's brother. These are not directly related to the central claim about the check-in date but serve to distract and increase the overall sense of conspiracy.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a straw man argument that the official narrative was presented as perfect and infallible from the very beginning. It attacks a minor discrepancy as if it unravels the entire case, ignoring the fact that initial details in complex investigations are often corrected over time.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text accuses authorities of lying and deception, but it does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing them of hypocrisy on an unrelated issue.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. It employs a vast majority (16 out of 18) of the listed techniques to achieve a specific goal: to erode trust in official institutions (the FBI, police, "mainstream media") and persuade the reader to accept a conspiratorial narrative. Rather than presenting information neutrally, it uses emotionally loaded language, logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy and causal oversimplification, and rhetorical devices like repetition and red herrings. The entire piece is structured not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, pre-determined conclusion—that authorities are engaged in a massive cover-up—by manufacturing doubt and appealing to fear and suspicion.
