Here's the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "radical leftist boss," "illegal criminals," "collaborate with illegal alien gang members" (insulting labels applied to the mayor and immigrants).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "#Resistance" is used multiple times to label the mayor and her supporters.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "#Resistance" is used as a brief, memorable label to categorize and dismiss the mayor and her actions.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "Her actions were quite clearly illegal," "making clear that this reckless decision was based on her political agenda," "864 'criminal aliens and public safety threats remain at large'", "that community's a lot less safe," "those who collaborate... should face the consequences" (instills fear of crime, danger, and legal repercussions).
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – While credibility is attacked via name-calling, the text doesn't explicitly *question* her credibility using doubt-based phrasing like "Can we trust her?" It makes direct negative assertions instead.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: Comparing the mayor's public warning to a "gang lookout yelling 'police'" is an extreme analogy. Minimization: The mayor's stated reason ("credible sources," consulting lawyers) is dismissed without serious consideration.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Implicit appeal to patriotism/identity by framing ICE as upholding the law ("obstructed justice," "violating federal immigration laws") and the mayor as undermining it, endangering officers, and protecting criminals.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "radical leftist boss," "illegal criminals," "reckless decision," "irresponsible decision," "endangered," "public safety threats," "criminal aliens," "collaborate," "face the consequences" (emotionally charged words with strong negative connotations).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – "And Dems have become honorary members of MS-13." (Associates Democrats with a universally despised violent criminal gang to disapprove of them and the mayor's actions).
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Popularity of the viewpoint (supporting ICE/opposing the mayor) isn't cited as a reason to agree.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – "864 'criminal aliens and public safety threats remain at large in the community, and I have to believe that some of them were able to elude us thanks to the mayor’s irresponsible decision.'" (Assumes the *sole* or primary cause for criminals remaining at large is the mayor's warning, ignoring other potential complexities like operational challenges, intelligence failures, or the inherent difficulty of locating targets).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and uses inflammatory but clear language. Terms like "criminal aliens" are loaded but not vague in intent.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Reliance on quotes from Thomas Homan (Acting ICE Director) and mentioning the DOJ investigation are used to validate the criticism and legal threat against the mayor.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Implied throughout: You are either supporting ICE/law enforcement/safety or you are aiding criminals/endangering the community/collaborating with gangs (like MS-13). The mayor's warning is framed solely as political agenda vs. public safety.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "That's exactly it." (Used to shut down discussion after the gang lookout analogy, implying the matter is settled and no further thought is needed). Also, "#Resistance" functions as a dismissive label.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Introducing the comparison to MS-13 and the statement about Democrats being "honorary members" diverts attention from the specific legal/ethical debate about the mayor's warning to a broader, inflammatory attack on a political group.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks the mayor's actual stated actions and their consequences as presented by her critics. It doesn't misrepresent her main argument (that she warned based on credible sources and legal advice to protect residents).
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text doesn't charge the mayor or her supporters with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated wrongs committed by others.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a dense concentration of propaganda techniques:
*   It heavily relies on **Name Calling** ("radical leftist boss," "illegal criminals," associating Dems with MS-13) and **Loaded Language** ("reckless," "irresponsible," "endangered," "criminal aliens," "collaborate") to demonize the mayor and immigrants.
*   It uses **Appeal to Fear** extensively, emphasizing danger to ICE officers and the community from "criminal aliens" remaining at large due to the mayor's actions.
*   It employs **Reduction ad Hitlerum** by explicitly linking Democrats to the violent gang MS-13 to discredit them.
*   It creates a **Black & White Fallacy**, framing the situation as a binary choice between supporting law enforcement/safety or aiding criminals/gangs.
*   It uses **Causal Oversimplification** by blaming the mayor solely for criminals evading capture.
*   It utilizes **Appeal to Authority** (ICE Director, DOJ) to legitimize its claims.
*   It employs **Slogans** ("#Resistance") and **Thought-terminating clichés** ("That's exactly it.") to dismiss opposing views.
*   It uses a **Red Herring** (the MS-13/Democrat association) to divert attention.
*   **Exaggeration** (the gang lookout analogy) and **Repetition** ("#Resistance") further reinforce the negative message.
*   **Flag-Waving** is present in the underlying appeal to support federal law enforcement against a local official portrayed as undermining it.

While the text reports on a real event (the mayor's warning and the subsequent DOJ review/ICE criticism), the language, framing, selective emphasis, and inclusion of inflammatory, unsupported claims (like the MS-13 association) are designed not to inform objectively, but to aggressively persuade the audience to adopt a specific, highly negative view of the mayor, her actions, immigrants, and Democrats, making it a clear example of propaganda. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the factual core of the DOJ review and ICE criticism, though these are presented within the overwhelming propaganda framework.
