1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Christine Blasey Ford as “the loon she is” and “obviously unbalanced,” and her lawyer as “even loonier.” It also labels some lawyers as “social justice warrior-lawyers.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly pushes the idea that the Democrats and Ford are intentionally delaying the process for political gain, using phrases like “delaying a confirmation vote,” “drag the confirmation process,” “trying to game the system,” and “clearly a desire to delay proceedings.”

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable, and repeated phrases that function as a slogan.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear and urgency by stating that if the confirmation is delayed, “the Supreme Court will begin hearing cases in its new term shorthanded,” implying a crisis or negative outcome for the justice system.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built around casting doubt on Christine Blasey Ford’s credibility, calling her accusations “never-credible” and quoting someone who says she “really doesn’t want to testify.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the Democrats' motives, claiming they wanted to “hurl the wild claims like a grenade at the last minute to blow up the process,” while minimizing the allegations against Kavanaugh by calling them “weak and ridiculous.”

7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use patriotic appeals or symbols to persuade the audience. Its appeal is partisan rather than nationalistic.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words such as “malicious agenda,” “wild claims,” “torpedo President Trump’s agenda,” and “utter nonsense” to frame one side negatively.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or other universally hated groups.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the entire complex political and personal situation to a single cause: the Democrats' “malicious agenda to block the nominee.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; its point of view and accusations are direct and clear.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from “former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova” as an expert voice to lend credibility to the claim that Ford’s allegations are baseless and that an FBI probe is “utter nonsense.”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a simple choice between supporting Kavanaugh's confirmation or being part of the “Left’s malicious agenda,” ignoring any possibility for a nuanced position, such as wanting a thorough investigation for the good of the institution.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “utter nonsense,” used to describe the demand for an FBI probe, is a dismissive cliché intended to shut down any serious consideration of the idea.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the fact that Judge Kavanaugh's wife received threats. While a serious issue, it is irrelevant to the validity of the allegations against Kavanaugh and serves to distract the reader and build sympathy for him.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text argues that Democrats “didn’t want to have a rational discussion” and only wanted to “blow up the process.” This misrepresents their stated argument (a desire for an FBI investigation before testifying) as an irrational attack.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses its attacks on the opponents in this specific situation and does not deflect criticism by pointing out hypocrisy on an unrelated matter.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint by employing a wide array of manipulative techniques.

The article systematically uses a combination of Name Calling (“loon”), Loaded Language (“malicious agenda”), and casting Doubt (“never-credible accusations”) to delegitimize Judge Kavanaugh’s accuser and the Democratic party. It relies on Causal Oversimplification, reducing the entire complex event to a simple political plot. The narrative is framed as a Black & White Fallacy, where one is either with the reasonable nominee or part of a malicious conspiracy.

Furthermore, it uses an Appeal to Authority (Joseph diGenova) to validate its claims and a Red Herring (threats to Kavanaugh's wife) to distract from the core issue and generate sympathy. The sheer number and blatant application of these techniques, woven around a few factual data points (like dates and the Senate's party composition) to give it a veneer of journalistic credibility, confirm its nature as a piece of propaganda designed to manipulate opinion rather than report objectively.
