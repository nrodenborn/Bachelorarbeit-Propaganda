Here is the analysis of the text based on the provided propaganda techniques:

Name calling – Yes – The text labels the American Medical Association (AMA) as "anti-American" and "Non-American" and associates its supporters with being "Socialist and Communist."

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times consecutively.

Slogans – No – The text does not employ its own brief, memorable phrases to be repeated. It references a phrase ("take the guns first") but attributes it to Donald Trump to criticize the AMA.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that the AMA's proposals will leave law-abiding citizens vulnerable: "It's going to infringe on the rights of those who don't commit crimes and need a gun to protect themselves..."

Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the credibility, knowledge, and motives of the AMA. For example: "Now, the majority of people at the AMA probably couldn't tell you any of these devices or items if they saw them, but they are advancing an agenda."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the AMA's proposals by framing them as "guns and ammunition confiscation." It also minimizes the issue of gun violence by pivoting to a different cause of death: "people are dying by the hundreds of thousands at the hands of drugs approved by the FDA".

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text constantly appeals to patriotism by framing the AMA's position as "anti-American" and "anti-constitutional," while presenting its own argument as a defense of "God-given rights" and the "constitutional militia."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to frame the AMA's proposals, such as calling their blog post a "diatribe" and their recommendations "government overreach and unconstitutional legislation."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of an idea by associating it with groups hated by the intended audience: "she fails, like every other Socialist and Communist, to tell us exactly how these measures keep people safe..."

Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of its idea. It frames itself as standing against a large, powerful organization (the AMA), not as part of a popular movement.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text provides a simplistic reason for the AMA's alleged hypocrisy regarding pharmaceutical companies: "I'll tell you why they aren't speaking out on that... they don't want to bite the hand that feeds them, plain and simple."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's writing is aggressive and direct, not deliberately unclear. While it accuses the AMA of vagueness ("Who knows exactly what they mean by high-capacity magazines"), the text itself is not obscure.

Appeal to authority – No – The text does not cite any authorities to support its own claims. It exclusively attacks the authority of the AMA and its representatives.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: one either supports the author's interpretation of the Second Amendment or is "anti-American." It offers no room for a nuanced or middle-ground position on gun control.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "...plain and simple" is used to end an argument, discouraging any further inquiry into the complex relationship between the AMA and pharmaceutical companies.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll, "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?", which is entirely irrelevant to the article's topic of the AMA and gun control. It serves only to distract and inject partisan bias.

Straw men – Yes – The author refutes a distorted version of the AMA's argument. By labeling the AMA's proposals as "gun confiscation," the author attacks an extreme position that misrepresents the more specific policies listed, such as red flag laws and expanding background checks.

Whataboutism – Yes – When addressing the AMA's concern for gun violence victims, the author deflects by charging the AMA with hypocrisy on a different issue: "Yeah, and people are dying by the hundreds of thousands at the hands of drugs approved by the FDA, but I don't hear you guys calling to shut down the unconstitutional FDA...?"

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. It employs a vast majority (14 out of 18) of the propaganda techniques listed. The entire piece is structured not to inform or foster a balanced discussion, but to persuade the reader through emotional manipulation and logical fallacies. It consistently uses techniques like Name-calling ("anti-American"), Flag-waving (appealing to the Constitution and "God-given rights"), and Loaded Language ("diatribe," "carnage") to create a strong emotional bias against the American Medical Association. Furthermore, it relies heavily on logical fallacies such as Whataboutism (deflecting to FDA-approved drugs), Red Herring (the irrelevant political poll), and Straw Men (misrepresenting the AMA's proposals as "confiscation") to attack its opponent rather than engaging with the substance of their arguments in good faith. The goal is not to debate policy but to discredit an entire organization and rally support for a single, unyielding viewpoint.
