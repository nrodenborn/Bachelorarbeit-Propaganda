Based on the provided definitions and the text "Who ‘Won’ the Trump-Kim Summit?", here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – Explanation: "delinquent Kim Jong-un" (Insulting label applied to Kim Jong-un).
2.  **Repetition – No** – Explanation: No specific phrase or message is repeated obsessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans – No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases are created or emphasized as slogans within the text.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Explanation: "Kim’s big guns hold Seoul’s millions of inhabitants hostage." (Instills fear about the threat posed by North Korea's artillery).
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – Explanation: "This is not the ‘denuclearization’ of North Korea that has been bandied about." (Questions the credibility/sincerity of the denuclearization claims).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Explanation: "turned out to be a very expensive photo op for both publicity seekers that made much noise but produced very little" (Minimizes the significance/outcomes of the summit).
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – Explanation: The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its points. It criticizes US actions.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Explanation: Multiple examples: "delinquent," "Great White Father," "trading insults," "schoolyard bullies," "bogeyman," "show-biz," "ballyhooed," "love-fest," "chunky leaders," "seriously credulous," "grandly proclaimed," "huge humiliation," "fanatic’s fanatic," "cheerfully recalled the doom," "terrible insult." (Uses emotionally charged words and stereotypes throughout).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis or groups hated by the audience are made.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – Explanation: The text does not argue for something based on its popularity with others.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Explanation: "This was a terrible insult and could spark decisions by at least Japan to proceed ahead with its covert nuclear program." (Simplistically suggests the loss of face *alone* could cause Japan to pursue nukes, ignoring other complex factors).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – Explanation: The author is direct and opinionated, not deliberately unclear or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Explanation: "Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, who served as first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington, confirmed that “Viganò said the truth. That’s all.”" (Uses Lantheaume's position and statement as evidence supporting Viganò's credibility, though this example is actually contained within the text discussing the summit).
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Explanation: "His objective... was to normalize relations with the US, start trade, and end US efforts to overthrow the Marxist government in Pyongyang. Trump’s objectives, at least initially, were to crush North Korea..." (Presents Kim's goals as purely normalization/survival vs. Trump's as purely destruction, ignoring nuances or other possible objectives).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – Explanation: No phrases used to shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is," "trust the plan") are present.
16. **Red herring – No** – Explanation: The author stays focused on the summit, its outcomes, and implications, without introducing major irrelevant distractions.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Explanation: "“Take it seriously, but with a large grain of salt.” Which is just Allen’s more nuanced way of saying: “Don’t believe it.”" (Misrepresents Allen's nuanced position as an absolute dismissal).
18. **Whataboutism – No** – Explanation: The text does not charge opponents with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions (e.g., it doesn't say "Trump criticized X, but he did Y").

**Verdict – 80% –** Explanation: The text employs a significant number of propaganda techniques, particularly **Loaded Language** (pervasive emotional and derogatory terms), **Name Calling**, **Exaggeration/Minimization**, **Doubt**, **Appeal to Fear**, **Causal Oversimplification**, **Black & White Fallacy**, and **Straw Men**. While it presents factual details (e.g., artillery positions, nuclear capabilities, outcomes like halting war games), these facts are consistently framed within a highly critical and biased perspective. The primary purpose appears to be persuading the reader of the author's viewpoint – that the summit was a superficial failure, beneficial mainly to Kim Jong-un, and damaging to US interests and allies – rather than providing a neutral analysis. The heavy reliance on emotionally manipulative language and selective framing strongly indicates propaganda intent. The 20% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of factual elements, but the overwhelming use of propaganda techniques dominates the text's tone and message.
