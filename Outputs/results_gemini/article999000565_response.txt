1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels like “Campus Commie” and “leftist loon” to attack the subject.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases intended for repeated use as a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses on ridicule and mockery rather than instilling fear in the audience about the consequences of the "leftist" actions.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The phrase “hysterical profanity-laden melodramatic hissy fit” is an exaggeration used to describe the student's emotional reaction.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like “Commie,” “hissy fit,” “hysterical,” “melodramatic,” and “loon” to evoke negative feelings and reinforce stereotypes.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text reports on the student using this technique (by calling Republicans “Nazis”), but the text itself does not use it to make its own point.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is correct because it is popular.

14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present a false dichotomy of only two choices.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “It doesn’t take much to trigger these people” is a cliché used to dismiss the subject's motivations and discourage any deeper analysis of the situation.
16. Red herring – Yes – The final question, “By the way…where are her pants?” is an irrelevant distraction intended to mock the student's appearance rather than address the substance of the event.
17. Straw men – No – The text focuses on attacking a person's character and actions rather than misrepresenting and refuting an argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the audience to adopt a negative view of "leftists." It achieves this by employing a multitude of propaganda techniques. Instead of presenting a neutral account of the event, it uses name-calling (“Campus Commie,” “loon”) and loaded language (“hissy fit,” “hysterical”) to dehumanize and ridicule the subject. It uses exaggeration to frame her actions as extreme and irrational. It distracts from the political substance of the conflict with a red herring about her clothing. Finally, it uses causal oversimplification and thought-terminating clichés (“It doesn’t take much to trigger these people”) to dismiss an entire group's political motivations as simple, irrational reactivity. The combination of these techniques creates a biased narrative designed to manipulate the audience's emotions and reinforce a specific political viewpoint, which is the essence of propaganda.
