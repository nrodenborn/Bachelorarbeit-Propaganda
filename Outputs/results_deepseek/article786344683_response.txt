### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:
1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Voto Latino is a sham."  
   *Explanation: "Sham" is an insulting label attacking Voto Latino's non-partisan claims.*  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on Google’s efforts to elect Clinton (e.g., "Google Was ‘Working To Get Hillary Clinton Elected’," "Google executives have been caught red-handed").  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "ALL Hispanics are in President Trump’s 'crosshairs'" implies a threat to mobilize voters against Trump.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Maybe that’s why they refused to appear before Congress last week?" questions Google’s credibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "blew the cover off" exaggerates Carlson’s role; "silent donation" minimizes Google’s involvement.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No overt appeals to patriotism or identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "caught red-handed," "sham," "vocally partisan" evoke negative emotions.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler or hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No explicit appeal to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames Google’s actions as the primary cause for Clinton’s support (e.g., linking Google’s "silent donation" to Latino turnout).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text cites specific emails and sources; no deliberate vagueness.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Tucker Carlson, WikiLeaks, and Breitbart as authoritative sources.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – No false dichotomy presented.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "case closed" that halt discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The unrelated comparison of Google/DuckDuckGo search results for "idiot" distracts from the election narrative.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting opponents.

### Verdict – 90% – Propaganda  
**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques to advance a one-sided narrative accusing Google of conspiring to elect Hillary Clinton. Key indicators include:  
- **Selective Evidence**: Uses cherry-picked emails (e.g., Eric Schmidt’s communications) and partisan sources (Breitbart, Tucker Carlson) while ignoring counter-evidence.  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language ("sham," "caught red-handed") and fear appeals (Latinos in Trump’s "crosshairs") stoke outrage.  
- **Exaggeration & Distortion**: Inflates Google’s influence (e.g., citing a study claiming search results shift voter opinions by 43.4%) and frames routine political outreach as nefarious.  
- **Omission of Context**: Fails to address Google’s stated policies or bipartisan activities, presenting actions as uniquely corrupt.  
- **Partisan Framing**: Labels Voto Latino’s efforts as "in-kind contribution[s] to Hillary Clinton" while dismissing its non-partisan status.  
- **Distraction**: The DuckDuckGo comparison diverts from core allegations.  

While the text references factual documents (e.g., emails), their interpretation is skewed to vilify Google and Clinton. The overwhelming reliance on biased sources, emotional rhetoric, and oversimplified causality confirms a propagandistic intent to persuade, not inform. The 10% uncertainty stems solely from the inclusion of verifiable emails, though their framing remains manipulative.
