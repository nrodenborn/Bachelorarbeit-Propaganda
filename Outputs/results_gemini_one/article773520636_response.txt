1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents and their ideas with insulting terms, such as in the title "Biblical Illiterates" and within the text, "confused, biblically illiterate friend," "Tyrant King George," and "perverse, modern-day, professing Christians."

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh is repeated three times in a row: "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?"

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses and promotes brief, memorable phrases as mottos, such as, "Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God!" and “No King but King Jesus.”

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests negative consequences for disagreeing with its position, implying that those who teach submission to corrupt authorities are leading people to "find yourselves to be fighting against God."

5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and knowledge of the person who wrote the opposing article. Example: "Apparently, this individual who wrote the article knows nothing of the Black Robed Regiment that the tyrant King George feared the most."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the scope of its own argument to make it seem more powerful. Example: "Furthermore, it would contradict what Scripture teaches us from Genesis all the way to Revelation every step of the way."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to American patriotism by repeatedly referencing the founding fathers and foundational U.S. documents. Example: "Maybe he should have taken the time to look to the founding forefathers and that document which they drew up called “The Declaration of Independence.”"

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses words with strong emotional connotations to influence the audience. Example: "Yet, this is what the perverse, modern-day, professing Christians are teaching the sheep in the American Church today."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of the opposing idea (submitting to government) by associating it with a group hated by the target audience (the Pharisees who crucified Jesus). Example: "If you remember, it was those same people who called for the crucifixion of Christ while crying out “We have no King but Caesar”"

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular or that "everyone is doing it." It argues for its position based on appeals to authority and identity, not popularity.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex situation. Example: "The sins of the fathers were the reason the Midianites had power to oppress them."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and its language is not deliberately unclear. The author's position is stated very explicitly.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from historical figures and the Bible as evidence for its claims. Example: "John Hancock, the first signer of the Declaration of Independence, said, “Resistance to tyranny becomes the Christian duty of each individual…""

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two choices: either resist corrupt government (which is obedience to God) or submit to it (which is fighting God), ignoring any other possibilities. Example: "I ask, are Christians to submit to those who have sanctioned the murder of the innocent in the womb (Exodus 20:13; Proverbs 6:17)? Absolutely not!"

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a phrase to discourage critical thought and dismiss counter-arguments. Example: "Common sense does come into play here."

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a completely irrelevant topic to distract the reader. Example: "take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?"

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes a simplified and distorted version of the opposing argument. Example: The author characterizes the opposing view as "submit to the tyrants and resist God, His Church and His Word," which is an easily defeated caricature of the complex theological position on obeying governing authorities.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text attacks its opponent's argument and knowledge directly, but does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing the opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It employs a vast majority (14 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques to persuade the reader. The author's goal is not to engage in a balanced theological or historical discussion, but to aggressively push a specific viewpoint. This is achieved by using emotionally charged and loaded language, attacking the character and intelligence of the opposition (name-calling, doubt), simplifying a complex biblical passage into a black-and-white choice, and wrapping the entire argument in patriotic appeals (flag-waving). The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Kavanaugh poll) further demonstrates that the piece is not a serious argument but a work of persuasion designed to manipulate the reader's emotions and allegiances.
