Verdict – 40% – The text exhibits some characteristics of propaganda, particularly through the use of appeal to fear, doubt, and loaded language. These elements suggest an intention to provoke skepticism and concern about the official narrative of the Las Vegas shooting. However, the text does not employ a wide range of propaganda techniques, and it primarily focuses on highlighting discrepancies in the timeline of events. Therefore, while there are elements of propaganda present, it is not overwhelmingly propagandistic.
