Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack a person or group. The term "illegally" is a legal and descriptive term for the status of the homes built without permits, not an ad hominem attack.

Repetition – No – The text does not repeat the same message or phrase over and over to reinforce it. It presents a variety of facts and figures from different sources.

Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases intended to be used as a rallying cry or for political persuasion.

Appeal to fear – No – While the text describes a frightening situation (the aftermath of a hurricane), it does not use fear to advocate for a particular idea or to discredit an alternative. It reports on the reality of the situation.

Doubt – No – The text does not attempt to question the credibility of any person or source. In fact, it relies on the credibility of its sources to inform the reader.

Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text uses specific figures and data attributed to official sources (e.g., "70,000 so far," "250,000 across the island," "winds up to 155 mph"). There is no evidence of intentional exaggeration or minimization.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use appeals to patriotism or national identity to make its case.

Loaded Language – No – The language used, such as "crisis," "destroyed," and "devastation," is strong but appropriate for describing the scale of the disaster. It is descriptive rather than being emotionally manipulative.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text makes no comparisons to Nazis or any other hated group.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is correct because it is popular or that the reader should adopt a certain viewpoint to be part of a group.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text avoids this by presenting a complex situation. While the headline points to illegal construction as a key factor, the article also mentions the hurricane's strength, outdated building codes, and poverty, showing that the problem has multiple causes.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is specific, using clear language, numbers, and named sources to convey information.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The article cites several authorities to support its claims. Example: "Puerto Rico's housing secretary, Fernando Gil, says the number of homes destroyed by the hurricane totals about 70,000 so far..." and "According to the National Weather Service, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico with winds up to 155 mph."

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present the situation as having only two possible outcomes or solutions. It describes a multifaceted problem.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any clichés to shut down critical thought. It is an informational piece.

Red herring – No – All the information presented, such as aid amounts, building codes, and evacuee numbers, is directly relevant to the topic of Puerto Rico's hurricane recovery.

Straw men – No – The text is a report, not an argument. It does not set up and refute a false version of an opposing viewpoint.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing others of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 5% – The text is overwhelmingly characteristic of a standard news report, not propaganda. Its primary function is to inform the public by presenting facts, figures, and quotes from relevant and named sources. It lacks the manipulative, emotional, and deceptive qualities that define propaganda. The vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques are absent. The one technique that is present, "Appeal to authority," is used in a standard journalistic manner to attribute information and lend credibility to the report, rather than as a logical fallacy to force a conclusion. The headline's framing ("Worsened By...") does direct the reader's attention to a specific aspect of the crisis, which is a mild form of agenda-setting, but the body of the article provides a more nuanced and factual account. Therefore, the likelihood of it being propaganda is extremely low.
