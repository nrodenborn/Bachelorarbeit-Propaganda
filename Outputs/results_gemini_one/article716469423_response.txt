1. Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack a person or group.
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea of the sun dimming is repeated throughout the text. Example: "the star our globe revolves around is dimming," "the sun is going dark," "it is also dimming," "measure the dimming of the sun’s irradiance," "decline in total solar irradiance (TSI)."
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief, memorable phrase as a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text is built around creating fear of an impending "ice age" and its consequences. Example: "A 15-YEAR long mini ice age could be due to hit the Northern hemisphere in just four years as the sun prepares for “hibernation” – triggering a barrage of cataclysmic events."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the mainstream scientific consensus on climate change by presenting this alternative theory. Example: "This warning will infuriate environmental campaigners who argue by 2030 the world faces increased sea levels and flooding due to glacial melt at the poles and a warming of the globe."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to create a sense of crisis. Example: "The Sun Is Going DARK" is an exaggeration of a cyclical decrease in solar activity.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader. Example: "triggering a barrage of cataclysmic events," "plunging global temperatures," "destabilization of the Earth’s crust," and "infuriate environmental campaigners."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to Nazis or other hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that the idea is true because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a highly complex phenomenon. Example: It directly links a decrease in sunspots to an impending "ice age," ignoring numerous other factors that influence Earth's climate.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague sourcing to create an illusion of broad consensus. Example: "But other sources say it’s more than possible that we will see a mini ice age," and "A team of experts have warned."
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites various sources, mixing credible ones with less credible ones, to support its claim. Example: "According to data from NASA’s Spaceweather," and "Research by the The Space and Science Research Center in Florida revealed a strong link..."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the climate issue as a choice between two extremes: a coming ice age or the global warming predicted by "environmental campaigners." Example: The final paragraph frames the issue as its "ice age" warning versus the "warming of the globe" argument.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion.
16. Red herring – No – While the text has many flaws, it does not introduce a significant, irrelevant topic to distract from its main argument.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the argument of "environmental campaigners" as a simple "warming of the globe" narrative, which it then attempts to refute with its "cooling" narrative, ignoring the complexity and nuances of climate science. Example: "This warning will infuriate environmental campaigners who argue by 2030 the world faces increased sea levels and flooding due to glacial melt at the poles and a warming of the globe."
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse its opponents of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the reader of a specific, alarming viewpoint by employing numerous propaganda techniques. The article is built on a foundation of **Appeal to Fear**, using **Loaded Language** ("cataclysmic," "barrage," "plunging") and **Exaggeration** ("The Sun Is Going DARK") to create a sense of immediate crisis. It uses **Appeal to Authority** by selectively citing sources, mixing data from a credible source like NASA with interpretations from less credible websites to lend its claims unearned legitimacy. The argument itself relies on **Causal Oversimplification** (low sunspots = ice age) and creates a **Straw Man** of mainstream climate science, which it frames as a simple "global warming" story. This is then presented as a **Black & White Fallacy**, forcing a choice between two extreme outcomes. The combination of emotional manipulation and logical fallacies, all aimed at pushing a specific agenda and discrediting an opposing view, is a clear hallmark of propaganda.
