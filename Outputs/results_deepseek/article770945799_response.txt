Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis of the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "corruption and criminal activity of Hillary Clinton". This is an insulting label applied to Clinton.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The core message of unequal treatment/prosecution compared to Clinton is repeated throughout the text: "unequal protection of the law", "unfair and unequal", "overzealous in prosecuting him... while going easy on... Clinton", "double standard", "minor military infraction compared to the treatment of politically connected individuals", "violation of the rights of all Americans to have equal protection under the law", "politically motivated".
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, brief, memorable phrase is used repeatedly as a slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – The text does not primarily try to instill fear about alternatives. It focuses on past injustice and unfairness.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Repeatedly questions the credibility and motives of Obama officials: "scapegoated by Obama officials", "politically motivated", "prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton’s emails", "accuse New York officials of trying to hinder his court fight".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – **Minimization**: Saucier calls his offense a "minor military infraction". This minimizes the seriousness of taking classified photos on a submarine. **Exaggeration**: Describing Clinton's actions as "corruption and criminal activity" and "more serious violations" while implying Saucier's prosecution was uniquely severe ("overzealous", "hard time", "glaring example") exaggerates the contrast.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to patriotism/constitutional rights: "The U.S. Constitution clearly states that all citizens are born with inalienable rights...", "...violation of the rights of all Americans to have equal protection under the law."
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Uses emotionally charged or stereotyping language: "let Hillary off the hook", "get off scot-free", "scapegoated", "overzealous", "double standard", "corruption and criminal activity", "politically motivated", "hinder his court fight", "lashed out".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No association with universally hated groups is made to disapprove an idea.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – While implying public dissatisfaction ("found themselves under fire"), the text doesn't explicitly appeal to the popularity of Saucier's viewpoint or lawsuit as a reason to agree.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes Saucier's prosecution solely to political motivations ("scapegoated by Obama officials", "politically motivated", "prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton’s emails"), ignoring other potential factors (like the nature of the evidence, military justice procedures, or differing circumstances between the cases).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is relatively clear about its accusations and claims, even if biased. No deliberate obscurity is evident.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites the U.S. Constitution as an authority: "The U.S. Constitution clearly states that all citizens are born with inalienable rights...". Also, relies heavily on Saucier's statements (the subject) as the primary source of information and framing.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as a stark binary: Saucier (non-politically connected, harshly punished for minor infraction) vs. Clinton (politically connected, let off scot-free for serious crimes). Ignores nuances, complexities, or other individuals/contexts.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Phrases like "equal protection under the law," "double standard," and "politically motivated" are used to frame the issue and potentially shut down deeper examination of the specific legal nuances, evidence differences, or procedural details between the two cases.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The core focus remains on the comparison between Saucier's and Clinton's treatment. While the barring of his lawyer is mentioned, it's presented as part of the overall narrative of hindrance, not an irrelevant distraction from the main point.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks the actual positions and actions of Obama officials regarding prosecutorial decisions, not misrepresented ones.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – The central argument of the text *is* Whataboutism. Saucier's lawsuit and the article's framing consistently charge the Obama officials with hypocrisy: "Why was I prosecuted harshly when Hillary Clinton wasn't prosecuted at all for something worse?" ("Comey and Obama’s willingness to not prosecute Hillary Clinton" vs. his prosecution; "overzealous in prosecuting him... while going easy on... Clinton"; "double standard that let Clinton get off scot-free"; "minor military infraction compared to the treatment of politically connected individuals").

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core argument relies heavily on Whataboutism, Black & White fallacy, and Causal Oversimplification, framing a complex legal situation as a simple, politically motivated double standard. It uses Loaded Language ("corruption," "criminal activity," "scapegoated," "double standard," "get off scot-free"), Name Calling against Clinton, and Flag-Waving (Constitution) to evoke strong emotional reactions (indignation, unfairness). Repetition reinforces the "unequal treatment" message. While based on a real lawsuit and events, the presentation is overwhelmingly one-sided, sourced almost exclusively from Saucier and framed to support his grievance using these techniques. The minimization of Saucier's offense and exaggeration of the Clinton contrast further manipulate the narrative. The use of Thought-terminating clichés discourages critical analysis of the differing legal contexts. While not every technique is present, the density and nature of those used strongly indicate a propagandistic intent to persuade the audience of a specific, politically charged narrative of injustice and bias.
