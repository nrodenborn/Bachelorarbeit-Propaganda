1. Name calling – No – The text is highly critical of the coroner's actions but does not use insulting labels to attack him personally. The criticism is focused on his defiance and delay, not on his character.
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that the coroner is unjustifiably withholding the autopsy report is repeated throughout the text, both in the author's narration and in the quotes used. For example, "Fudenberg...seems determined to not release the autopsy report," "They (the coroner’s office) have delayed this for too long," and "The coroner’s office has fought to keep autopsy reports confidential."
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases to crystallize its point. Examples include: "No more games." and "Release the records."
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text primarily appeals to suspicion and outrage about a potential cover-up, rather than instilling fear in the audience about a specific threat or alternative.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built around casting doubt on the credibility and motives of the coroner's office. Examples include: "Seriously, it's been four months already!", "How can the autopsy report not be ‘finalized’ when the body was cremated more than five weeks ago?", and "we have questions as to whether the body was even that of Stephen Paddock".
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the situation by comparing it to a famous conspiracy theory: "Wait, were the same guys in the autopsy room that were there when the doctors and coroners examined John F Kennedy ?" This implies a conspiracy of a similar scale.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the American value of government transparency. For example: "The law is squarely on the side of the public’s right to open government.” The source, "Sons Of Liberty Media," itself evokes patriotic sentiment.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses words with strong emotional connotations to influence the reader's perception. Examples include "defies," "games," and the phrase "Something is rotten in Denmark!" which implies deep corruption.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that the idea is correct because it is popular. It uses quotes from news organizations, which is an appeal to authority, not bandwagon.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text implies a simple cause (a deliberate cover-up) for the delay in releasing the report, ignoring potentially complex legal and investigative reasons. The simple explanation offered is, "Something is rotten in Denmark!"
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is not vague; it is accusing the coroner's office of being vague and secretive. The author's position is very clear.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on the authority of the lawyer Maggie McLetchie, the editor Keith Moyer, and the news organizations they represent (*Las Vegas Review-Journal*, *The Associated Press*) to validate its argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either the coroner releases the report immediately (the correct action) or he is engaged in a malicious cover-up ("games," "rotten"). It does not allow for any middle ground, such as legitimate procedural delays.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a classic cliché to discourage further thought and cement a conclusion: "Something is rotten in Denmark!" This phrase serves to end analysis by asserting corruption is the obvious cause.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces an irrelevant and highly distracting piece of information to fuel suspicion: "Wait, were the same guys in the autopsy room that were there when the doctors and coroners examined John F Kennedy ?" The JFK assassination has no bearing on this case but serves to introduce the idea of a high-level conspiracy.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not invent a false argument for the coroner and then refute it. It directly attacks the coroner's stated reason for the delay ("not finalized"), questioning its validity.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy. It maintains a direct focus on the actions of the coroner.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it is based on a real news event (a lawsuit to release public records) and uses factual quotes, its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly suspicious, and conspiratorial viewpoint. The article moves beyond reporting by employing numerous propaganda techniques. It uses loaded language ("defies," "games") and repetition to frame the coroner as a villain. It heavily relies on casting doubt through rhetorical questions and introduces a red herring (the JFK comparison) and a thought-terminating cliché ("Something is rotten in Denmark!") to suggest a cover-up without providing direct evidence. The presentation is a black & white fallacy, where the only alternative to immediate release is a sinister conspiracy. The combination of these techniques, along with the one-sided framing and the suggestive name of the source ("Sons Of Liberty Media"), indicates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions rather than to provide a balanced and objective account of the event.
