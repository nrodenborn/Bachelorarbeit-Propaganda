### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation:* No insulting labels are used against any subject. The text neutrally describes space missions.

2. **Repetition** – No  
   *Explanation:* Key terms (e.g., "moon," "mission") appear contextually, not repetitively for persuasive effect.

3. **Slogans** – No  
   *Explanation:* No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Build the Wall") are used. Descriptions are factual.

4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
   *Explanation:* No attempts to instill fear about alternatives. The tone is informative, not alarmist.

5. **Doubt** – No  
   *Explanation:* No questioning of credibility (e.g., "Can the same be said for...?"). Statements are matter-of-fact.

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No  
   *Explanation:* Achievements (e.g., "first evidence of water ice") and limitations ("could be over in two weeks") are stated objectively.

7. **Flag-Waving** – No  
   *Explanation:* No appeals to patriotism (e.g., "We the People"). India’s ambitions are noted without nationalist rhetoric.

8. **Loaded Language** – No  
   *Explanation:* Language is neutral (e.g., "shadowy poles," "souvenir rock" are descriptive, not emotionally charged).

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *Explanation:* No comparisons to hated groups (e.g., Nazis/Vichy). The text avoids historical or ideological analogies.

10. **Bandwagon** – No  
    *Explanation:* No emphasis on popularity (e.g., "Time for US to do same"). Focuses on India’s goals, not peer pressure.

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No  
    *Explanation:* No simplistic causes (e.g., "If France hadn’t declared war..."). Complexities (delays, technical challenges) are acknowledged.

12. **Obfuscation** – No  
    *Explanation:* No vague or confusing language. Details (e.g., mission timeline, location) are specific and clear.

13. **Appeal to authority** – No  
    *Explanation:* No use of authoritative figures to validate claims. References to NASA/scientists are contextual, not persuasive.

14. **Black & white fallacy** – No  
    *Explanation:* No false dilemmas (e.g., "oppose evil or feed it"). Multiple perspectives (NASA’s plans, challenges) coexist.

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No  
    *Explanation:* No phrases halting debate (e.g., "I do not see any problems"). The text invites inquiry (e.g., "scientists think").

16. **Red herring** – No  
    *Explanation:* No irrelevant distractions. All details (e.g., Russia’s withdrawal, solar limitations) directly relate to the mission.

17. **Straw men** – No  
    *Explanation:* No misrepresentation of opposing arguments. The text reports facts without reframing debates.

18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    *Explanation:* No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., "Trump avoided military service"). Focus remains on India’s mission.

### Final Verdict:
**Verdict – 5% –** The text is a factual, informative report about India’s lunar mission (Chandrayaan-2), detailing technical aspects, historical context, and scientific goals without employing persuasive language, emotional appeals, or partisan framing. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges that highlighting national achievements (e.g., India’s self-reliance after Russia’s withdrawal) could subtly evoke pride, but this is incidental rather than manipulative. The absence of loaded terminology, fear tactics, or rhetorical fallacies confirms its journalistic intent.
