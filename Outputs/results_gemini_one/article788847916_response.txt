Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Amber Guyger as a “killer cop” and describes the act as a “cold-blooded killing.”
Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is repeated three times in a row.
Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as a rallying cry.
Appeal to fear – No – The text aims to generate outrage and a sense of injustice rather than instilling fear of a future negative outcome.
Doubt – Yes – The article directly questions the credibility of Police Chief Renee Hall’s statement that she cannot fire Guyger, quoting an expert who said, “It seemed like Chief Hall might not have been well informed on the law.”
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The phrase “cold-blooded killing” is an exaggeration used to frame the event in the most negative light possible. The department's explanation is minimized with the line, "Exactly what “investigative process” needs to happen before they can fire her remains unclear".
Flag-Waving – No – The article does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases such as “cold-blooded killing,” “innocent Botham Jean,” “killer cop,” and “unarmed, innocent, pillar of society.”
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or group to the Nazis or other universally hated groups.
Bandwagon – No – The article does not suggest readers should agree with an idea simply because it is popular.
Causal Oversimplification – No – The article argues against a simple cause offered by the Police Chief, suggesting the situation is more complex than presented.
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article accuses the Dallas Police Department of using vague explanations, but the author’s own language is direct and clear in its accusations.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites “experts,” civil rights attorney Justin Moore, and the news outlet WFAA as authorities to contradict the Police Chief’s claims.
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a binary choice: either Guyger is subject to the same rules as “common citizens” or she is part of a corrupt system with a “different set of rules,” ignoring potential nuances in civil service law.
Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text encourages critical thought about the official statements rather than using phrases to shut it down.
Red herring – Yes – The poll embedded in the middle of the article, asking “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?”, is completely irrelevant to the topic of the Dallas Police Department and serves as a distraction.
Straw men – No – The article directly addresses and attempts to refute the specific argument made by the Police Chief, rather than misrepresenting it.
Whataboutism – Yes – The article charges the Dallas Police Department with hypocrisy by asking why Guyger hasn’t been fired when other officers in similar situations, like Amy Wilburn and Cardan Spencer, were.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. While it reports on a real event and contains factual elements (such as direct quotes from the police chief), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint of the Dallas Police Department. It achieves this by employing a multitude of propaganda techniques. The most prominent are Loaded Language ("cold-blooded killing," "killer cop") and Name Calling to evoke an emotional response of outrage. It heavily uses Doubt and Appeal to Authority to systematically dismantle the credibility of the official police statement while bolstering its own argument. It employs Whataboutism by citing past firings to paint the department as hypocritical and a Black & White Fallacy to frame the situation as a simple case of police corruption versus justice for "common citizens." The inclusion of a completely irrelevant Red Herring poll further reveals its nature as a piece of content designed to manipulate and engage readers for purposes beyond the scope of the story itself. The combination of these techniques creates a one-sided narrative that discourages nuance in favor of a simple, emotionally charged conclusion.
