**Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, black & white fallacy, and whataboutism. These elements suggest a strong likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it aims to persuade the audience by emphasizing negative aspects of Pope Benedict XVI's resignation and the current state of the Catholic Church, while using emotionally charged language and oversimplified arguments. However, it lacks some techniques like slogans, flag-waving, and reduction ad Hitlerum, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood.**
