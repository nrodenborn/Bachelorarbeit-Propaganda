Based on the definitions provided and the text "3-D-printed guns put carnage a click away," here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "avowed anarchist" (used to label Cody Wilson negatively), "foolhardy move" (used to label the State Department's action).
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – While dangers are emphasized, the exact same phrase or message is not repeated verbatim multiple times.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, catchy, memorable phrase designed for easy recall is used (e.g., "Make America Great Again"). "Ghost guns" is descriptive, not a slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Repeatedly emphasizes dangers: "carnage a click away," "alarmed... law enforcement," "terrorists and gunmen," "loss of more innocent lives," "used... as part of criminal enterprises," "dangerous scenario," "troubling and dangerous settlement." This instills fear about the consequences of 3D-printed guns.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions the administration's motives/decision: "inexplicable decision," "senseless decision," "find out... whether groups such as the National Rifle Association were involved."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes (Exaggeration)** – "carnage a click away" exaggerates the immediacy and scale of the threat. Minimization is less prominent, but focusing solely on the dangers while briefly acknowledging the free speech claim could be seen as minimizing the opposing argument.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Uses highly charged, emotional, or negatively connotative words: "carnage," "alarmed," "dangerous scenario," "inexplicable," "stunning," "worship at the altar," "senseless," "troubling," "terrorists," "gunmen," "foolhardy," "loopholes," "loss of more innocent lives."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No attempt to link the idea or its supporters to universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – While it mentions groups that are alarmed ("leading gun safety groups and law enforcement officials"), it doesn't explicitly argue that the reader should agree *because* it's popular or widely accepted. It presents their concern as evidence of danger, not popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes the potential for increased violence and loss of life almost solely to the release of the blueprints ("Releasing instructions... will lead directly to the loss of more innocent lives"), oversimplifying the complex causes of gun violence.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is relatively clear and direct about its claims and arguments. It does not rely on deliberately obscure language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites "leading gun safety groups and law enforcement officials" being alarmed, Senator Menendez questioning the policy, and the Brady Center/Giffords/Everytown filing suit as authorities whose concern validates the danger.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the settlement as unequivocally bad and dangerous ("troubling," "dangerous," "senseless," "foolhardy") without acknowledging any potential counter-arguments (like free speech principles) as valid considerations in the decision. The problem is presented as clear-cut.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is," "common sense," or "America First" are used to shut down discussion. The text actually invites more inquiry (FOIA request) and action.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The discussion stays focused on the topic of 3D-printed guns, the settlement, and their perceived dangers. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text summarizes the opposing side's actions (Wilson's lawsuit, free speech claim, administration's settlement) and criticizes them directly, not a misrepresented or weaker version.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not accuse proponents of 3D-printed gun blueprints of hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated issues.

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits several hallmarks of propaganda: strong use of **Appeal to Fear**, **Loaded Language**, **Name Calling**, **Appeal to Authority**, **Causal Oversimplification**, and the **Black & White Fallacy**. It presents a highly one-sided, emotionally charged argument against the release of 3D-printed gun blueprints and the Trump administration's settlement, emphasizing danger while minimizing counterarguments. While it reports facts (the lawsuit, settlement, groups involved), the selection of facts, framing, and language are heavily biased towards persuasion and alarm. However, it stops short of being pure propaganda because it doesn't rely heavily on techniques like Repetition, Slogans, or Obfuscation, and it references specific events and actors (the lawsuit, Wilson, specific organizations). It functions more as a strongly opinionated editorial or advocacy piece using propagandistic techniques rather than disinformation. The 70% reflects the significant use of persuasive/propaganda techniques within a factual framework.
