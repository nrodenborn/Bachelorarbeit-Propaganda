Based on the definitions provided and the text analysis:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "radical leftist gun grabbing anti-liberty California General Xavier Becerra" (Insulting labels applied to Becerra).
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – No significant repetition of the same core message throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans (e.g., BUILD THE WALL).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – While Becerra's quoted statement *uses* fear ("endangered our children..."), BL is *dismissing* that fear claim as "preposterous... argle-bargle", not using fear to support his own point.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "California General Xavier Becerra is lying when he says..." (Directly questioning Becerra's credibility/truthfulness).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Calling Becerra's statement "preposterous left-wing political argle-bargle" minimizes the seriousness of the concern expressed.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No overt appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "radical leftist", "gun grabbing", "anti-liberty", "Department of Just(Us)", "preposterous", "argle-bargle" (Emotionally charged words and stereotypes).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Hitler or Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to the popularity of the idea.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – "It was a case the government was about to lose." (Oversimplifies the legal situation and reasons for the settlement as solely based on imminent defeat).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – "Department of Just(Us)" (Intentional misspelling to imply bias/corruption without evidence, obscuring the actual department name).
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – "The settlement was approved by a federal judge." (Using the judge's approval as evidence supporting the legitimacy of the settlement/BL's point).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – "The federal government has no standing to restrict speech in this manner." (Presents the complex legal issue of regulating potentially dangerous technical data as a simple, absolute free speech issue with no middle ground or nuance).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" or "trust the plan" used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – While the settlement details are used to counter Becerra, they are directly relevant to the core dispute (why the blueprints were going to be released). Not clearly *irrelevant*.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – BL dismisses Becerra's concern as "preposterous left-wing political argle-bargle" and implies Becerra is lying about the administration's action being inexplicable/dangerous. This misrepresents Becerra's stated position (which focuses on the *consequences* of the action) and refutes an exaggerated, simplistic version of his argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – BL does not charge Becerra or the states with hypocrisy on a related issue.

**Verdict – 80% –** The core Los Angeles Times article excerpt is standard news reporting, presenting facts, quotes, and a legal ruling neutrally. However, the significant portion of the text attributed to "-BL" (the rebuttal) employs numerous propaganda techniques very heavily. These include **Name Calling**, **Doubt**, **Exaggeration/Minimization**, **Loaded Language**, **Causal Oversimplification**, **Obfuscation**, **Appeal to Authority**, **Black & White Fallacy**, and **Straw Men**. The purpose of the BL text is not just to refute the article but to aggressively discredit the opposing side (Becerra, the states, the judge) using emotionally charged language, oversimplification, and attacks, rather than solely presenting reasoned counter-arguments. The density and nature of these techniques within the BL section strongly indicate a propagandistic intent to persuade through manipulation rather than balanced discourse. While the news article itself isn't propaganda, the dominating presence and techniques used in the rebuttal make the overall text highly likely to be propaganda.
