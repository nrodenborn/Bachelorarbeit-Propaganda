3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "release of 50-year-old records are going to result in the United States falling into the ocean" (exaggerated fear to dismiss "national security" claims).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "What is amazing... is the extreme nonchalance of the mainstream media" (questions media credibility).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes "national security" as "the two most important and meaningless words"; exaggerates CIA motives ("cover-up of its assassination").

16. **Red herring** – Yes – References unrelated CIA operations (Iran, Guatemala) to distract from JFK records specifics.

### Verdict – 85% –   
The text is highly likely propaganda due to its heavy reliance on emotionally loaded language (e.g., "cover-up," "frame-up"), oversimplification of complex events (CIA as sole orchestrator), and multiple persuasive techniques (e.g., fear appeals, straw men, repetition). It presents a one-sided narrative that dismisses opposing views (e.g., mocking "national security" concerns) while lacking concrete evidence for its claims about CIA guilt. Though it raises valid questions about transparency, its tone is accusatory and manipulative, aiming to persuade rather than inform. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges its basis in real events (JFK records release) but underscores its biased execution.
