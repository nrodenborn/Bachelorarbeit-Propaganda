14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomies (e.g., "only two choices").

### Verdict – 3% –  
**Explanation**: The text is **not propaganda**. It is a factual, informational piece about NASA’s New Horizons mission, emphasizing scientific achievement with minimal persuasive intent. The tone is celebratory but objective, using specific data (e.g., "3.79 billion miles") and expert quotes (Appeal to Authority) for credibility, not manipulation. Words like "remarkable" and "crazy" reflect genuine enthusiasm for space exploration without exaggeration. The 3% likelihood accounts for the minor use of awe-inspiring language, which could subtly promote NASA’s public image, but this is incidental to the article’s educational purpose. No political, ideological, or deceptive framing is detected.
