Name calling – Yes – The text attacks opponents with insulting labels, for example, calling those who oppose Kavanaugh a "political lynch mob out for blood."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the exact same poll question three times in a row: "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?"

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases that function as a standalone slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear in the reader with its title: "If Kavanaugh Is Not Confirmed By Senate, Then We Are All Just One Accusation Away From Ruin".

Doubt – Yes – The text is built around questioning Christine Ford's credibility, for example by asking: "If this had been such a pivotal moment for her, how could she have forgotten any those facts?"

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the alleged assault by reframing it as a common teenage interaction: "Kavanaugh may have made a pass at her as 17-year-old boys (and even some 17-year-old girls) are known to do. Ford said no and that was it."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the reader's identity as an American and their patriotism, stating: "What is happening in the Brett Kavanaugh nomination process should concern every American."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as describing Kavanaugh as being "smeared on the national stage by a political lynch mob out for blood."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other groups hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that even potential dissenters are joining the author's side to create an impression of growing consensus: "Even Senators Jeff Flake, Bob Corker and Lindsey Graham, who have all said Ford needs to be heard, have indicated that if she does not show up for Monday's hearing, they will schedule a vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation."

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a single, simple cause for the timing of the accusation, ignoring other complex factors: "Dianne Feinstein chose to sit on it until the moment it could inflict maximum political damage."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its assertions and arguments and does not use deliberately unclear or obscure expressions.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the quotes of public figures as evidence for its claims: "Ben Shapiro spoke to Fox News' Martha MacCallum and said 'you have to have some evidence before you destroy a man's life.'"

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two possible scenarios for the event in question: "Either this did not happen at all or a much milder version of the situation she alleges occurred."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a quote to dismiss the opposition's reasoning and discourage further thought: "Gregg Jarrett says it's 'because they're zealous to the point where they've lost their common sense.'"

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a completely irrelevant poll to distract the reader from the main topic: "take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?"

Straw men – Yes – The text constructs and then refutes a weakened, hypothetical version of Christine Ford's testimony in the form of a mock cross-examination: "Defense Attorney : When did this occur Ms. Ford? Ms. Ford : I'm not exactly sure."

Whataboutism – Yes – The text includes a quote that charges the opposition with hypocrisy and double standards: "You believe any woman who goes against a Republican and you don't believe any woman who goes against a Democrat."

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast array of the listed techniques (15 out of 18) to construct a one-sided narrative designed to persuade the reader through emotional manipulation and logical fallacies rather than a balanced presentation of facts. The article systematically uses techniques like Doubt, Name-calling, and Straw Men to discredit Christine Ford, while simultaneously using Appeal to Authority, Bandwagon, and Flag-Waving to legitimize its own position. The use of Loaded Language ("lynch mob," "smear") and Appeal to Fear (the title itself) aims to provoke a strong emotional response, bypassing critical reasoning. The presence of multiple logical fallacies, such as the Black & White Fallacy and Causal Oversimplification, further demonstrates that the author's primary goal is persuasion at the expense of objective truth. The combination of so many different techniques makes the text a clear and potent example of propaganda.
