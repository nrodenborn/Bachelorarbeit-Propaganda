Here is the analysis of the propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "thin-skinned regime" (referring to North Korea), "dim-witted US ambassador" (referring to Nikki Haley).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No significant repeated phrases or ideas beyond thematic consistency.  
3. **Slogans** – No – The title "End The Korean War!" functions as a call to action but lacks the memorability or brevity of a classic slogan.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Extensive descriptions of nuclear threats, casualties ("250,000 US casualties"), radioactive contamination, and civilian vulnerabilities to instill fear about military action.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Trump’s competence ("painted the US into a corner," "amateur foreign policymakers") and undermines U.S. systems ("ABM systems don’t work very well").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes North Korea’s current threat to North America ("can’t today seriously threaten") while exaggerating future risks ("probably will by 2019"). Casualty estimates ("2.5 million Koreans died") lack sourcing.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity; instead critiques U.S. actions.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms like "bloody slog," "vaporized," "hysteria," and "beating the war drums" evoke strong reactions.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or Hitler.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeals to popularity; references to Pakistan/Israel are analogies, not popularity claims.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Attributes North Korea’s nuclear pursuit to deterrence but acknowledges multiple factors (e.g., U.S. regime-change operations).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are specific and detailed (e.g., missile ranges, troop numbers).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites Eric Margolis’ books ("American Raj," "War at the Top") to imply expertise.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Presents diplomacy as preferable to war but acknowledges complexities (e.g., notes U.S. military reluctance).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to shut down debate; invites discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – No – Focus remains on North Korea; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Critiques actual policies (e.g., Trump’s threats, naval exercises) without misrepresentation.  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – "President Trump – who himself avoided national military service in the 1960’s – keeps beating the war drums" charges hypocrisy.  

---

**Verdict – 65%** – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques (e.g., **appeal to fear**, **loaded language**, **name calling**, **whataboutism**) and selectively frames facts to argue against U.S. military action. It emphasizes worst-case scenarios (nuclear fallout, casualties) while downplaying alternatives, uses emotionally loaded terms ("bloody slog," "hysteria"), and attacks figures like Trump and Haley. However, it also incorporates verifiable facts (e.g., missile capabilities, historical context) and avoids overt falsehoods. The one-sided advocacy, emotional manipulation, and lack of counterarguments align with propaganda, but its reliance on factual anchors prevents a higher percentage. It aims to persuade through fear and moral outrage rather than balanced analysis.
