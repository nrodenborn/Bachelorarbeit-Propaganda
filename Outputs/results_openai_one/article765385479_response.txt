**Verdict – 85% – The text employs numerous propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, exaggeration, flag-waving, and others, to persuade the audience of Julian Assange's unjust treatment and the need for action. The use of emotionally charged language and comparisons to historical events like the Vichy government further indicates a strong likelihood of propaganda. While the text presents factual information, the manner in which it is presented suggests an intent to influence opinion rather than provide a balanced view.**
