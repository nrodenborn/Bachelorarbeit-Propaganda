***

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it begins by quoting factual news reports, it quickly pivots to a commentary section that employs numerous propaganda techniques. The author uses Loaded Language ("black gunman shooting two white cops") and Causal Oversimplification to frame a specific crime as a direct consequence of the "Blacks Lives Matter" movement, which serves as a Red Herring to distract from the facts of the case and inject a political narrative. The author also uses Doubt and a Straw Man argument to attack the journalistic integrity of the Associated Press for not conforming to this narrative. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's perception of the event, moving it from a crime report to a piece of political commentary designed to stoke racial division and anger, which is a primary function of propaganda.
