Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the audience to adopt a negative and hostile view of a political group ("leftists"). This is achieved through the heavy use of propaganda techniques, including Name Calling ("Campus Commie," "leftist loon"), Loaded Language ("hysterical," "hissy fit"), and Exaggeration to frame the subject as unhinged and irrational. It creates a clear "us vs. them" narrative. The inclusion of a Red Herring ("By the way…where are her pants?") is a deliberate tactic to dehumanize the subject and distract from any substantive political issue, focusing instead on ridicule. The overall tone, framing, and word choice are all hallmarks of propaganda designed to reinforce an in-group's prejudice against an out-group.
