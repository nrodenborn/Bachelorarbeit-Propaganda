1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses the term “blue privilege” as an insulting label for the perceived preferential treatment given to police officers. It also refers to Amber Guyger as a "killer" rather than using more neutral terms like "the accused" or "the officer."

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times in a row within the text.

3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase “blue privilege” is used as a brief, memorable phrase that encapsulates the article's entire argument.

4. Appeal to fear – No – The text primarily aims to generate anger, outrage, and a sense of injustice rather than instilling fear in the audience about a future threat.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on the credibility of both Amber Guyger's story and the police investigation. For example: "...eyewitness testimony has contradicted her initial statement" and "It would be reasonable to assume that these steps were taken intentionally because they want to see her get away with it."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration for effect, such as, "Not even the richest people in the country with the best lawyers would receive this type of treatment..." It also minimizes the discovery of marijuana in the victim's apartment by calling it "a very small amount" to counter the police's alleged narrative.

7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its point.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases designed to evoke a strong reaction from the reader. Examples include "rot in jail," "glaring example," "innocent man," "smear his name," and "license to kill."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other universally hated groups.

10. Bandwagon – No – The article mentions protestors but does not use their popularity as a reason for the reader to adopt its viewpoint.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex legal proceedings and investigative actions entirely to the simple cause of "blue privilege," ignoring other potential legal or procedural factors. For example: "The case of Amber Guyger... is a glaring example of “blue privilege” at work in our society."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and clear in its accusations and point of view; it does not use vague language to confuse the reader.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text quotes "Attorney Lee Merritt, who represents Botham Jean’s family," using his position as a legal authority to lend credibility to its claims of injustice.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The article presents the situation as a simple conflict between two sides: the innocent victim and peaceful protestors versus a corrupt and malicious police system. For example, the headline "Amber Guyger Free on Bail as Activists Who Peacefully Protested Her Rot in Jail" creates a stark and simplistic contrast.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that present a conclusion as self-evident to discourage further questioning. For example: "It is obvious in this case that Guyger is receiving special treatment..."

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll that is completely irrelevant to the article's subject matter. The question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" serves only to distract the reader and collect data.

17. Straw men – Yes – The article claims the police found marijuana and "attempted to use to smear his name and somehow justify the killing." This reframes the police's action (reporting evidence found at a scene) as an explicit attempt to "justify the killing," an argument the police may not have made, making it easy to attack.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The article repeatedly contrasts the treatment of Amber Guyger with the treatment of the protestors to charge the justice system with hypocrisy. For example: "As Guyger walks free awaiting her trial, the 9 people who were arrested protesting the murder... are still sitting behind bars."

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. While it is based on a real event, its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly emotional, and critical viewpoint. It achieves this by employing a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques. The language is heavily loaded with emotional terms ("rot in jail," "license to kill") to provoke outrage. It uses name-calling and slogans ("blue privilege") to create a simple, negative frame for a complex issue (causal oversimplification). It presents a black & white fallacy of innocent victims versus a corrupt system, reinforced by whataboutism that highlights the perceived hypocrisy of the protestors' treatment versus Guyger's. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring poll further demonstrates that the publisher's intent is not purely journalistic but involves manipulation and data gathering. The cumulative effect of these techniques is a powerful piece of persuasive writing that systematically steers the reader away from objective analysis and towards a pre-determined conclusion.
