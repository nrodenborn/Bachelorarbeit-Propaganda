Certainly! Here is the analysis for each propaganda technique, followed by the final verdict:

---

**1. Name calling – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text refers to Obama’s actions as “reckless appeasement,” calls his nuclear deal “disastrous,” and refers to Iran as a “hegemonic threat,” “radical Shiite Iranian regime,” and “largest state sponsor of terrorism.” These are all negative labels intended to discredit.

**2. Repetition – Yes – Explanation:**  
The idea of Iran as a threat and Obama’s failures is repeated throughout: “Obama’s reckless appeasement,” “Obama turned his back,” “Obama precipitously removed,” “Obama’s disastrous nuclear deal,” etc.

**3. Slogans – No – Explanation:**  
There are no brief, memorable catchphrases or slogans used in the text.

**4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text repeatedly warns of Iran’s “hegemonic threat,” “expansion,” “aggression,” and “terrorist proxies,” and claims Iran is turning countries into “vassal states” and “satellites,” all designed to instill fear.

**5. Doubt – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text questions the credibility and actions of the Obama administration: “Obama turned his back on millions of dissidents,” “Obama ran down our options in Syria so thoroughly,” etc.

**6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation:**  
Obama’s actions are described as “reckless appeasement,” “disastrous,” and the text claims his deal “legitimized Iran's path to eventually becoming a nuclear-armed state,” which is an exaggeration of the deal’s consequences.

**7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation:**  
There are appeals to U.S. and Israeli patriotism: “Israel will also do what is necessary to repel Iranian-backed forces,” “Israel is determined to continue addressing it on its own,” and references to “U.S. interests in the region and beyond.”

**8. Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation:**  
Terms like “radical Shiite Iranian regime,” “largest state sponsor of terrorism,” “disastrous nuclear deal,” “milquetoast approach,” and “new monster” are emotionally charged.

**9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation:**  
There are no comparisons to Nazis or other universally reviled groups.

**10. Bandwagon – No – Explanation:**  
There is no explicit appeal to popularity or suggestion that “everyone” agrees.

**11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text claims, “Obama precipitously removed the remaining U.S. combat troops from Iraq, giving rise to ISIS’s re-emergence,” which oversimplifies a complex situation.

**12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanation:**  
The text is direct in its accusations and does not use vague or obscure language to confuse.

**13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text quotes several authorities: “Andrew Tabler, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy,” “National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster,” and “Jonathan Spyer in an article for Foreign Policy.”

**14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text presents only two options: Obama’s approach (bad/weak) vs. Trump’s approach (good/strong), with no middle ground.

**15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – Explanation:**  
There are no clichés that shut down discussion.

**16. Red herring – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text diverts from the main issue (Iran’s actions) to criticize Obama’s past actions and the U.S.-led coalition’s supposed inaction, which distracts from the current situation.

**17. Straw men – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text attributes overly simplistic or extreme positions to Obama (e.g., “Obama’s disastrous nuclear deal with Iran legitimized Iran's path to eventually becoming a nuclear-armed state”) that may not reflect his actual policy or statements.

**18. Whataboutism – No – Explanation:**  
The text does not directly accuse opponents of hypocrisy by comparing their actions to others.

### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 95% – The text exhibits a high number of classic propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, red herring, and straw men. The language is emotionally charged and designed to sway the reader against Obama and Iran while supporting Israel and the Trump administration. The text frames issues in a binary, us-vs-them manner, oversimplifies complex geopolitical events, and uses selective authority figures to bolster its arguments. While it contains factual elements, the overwhelming use of manipulative techniques makes it highly likely to be propaganda.**
