Based on the definitions provided and the text "MS-503 Gang Member Apprehended by Border Patrol Agents In Arizona," here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – The text uses the official designation "MS-503 Gang member" and "Mara Salvatrucha-503 Gang," which are factual labels, not insulting labels applied for the purpose of attack.
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific message or phrase is repeated throughout the text to emphasize a point.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to rally support or encapsulate a message (e.g., no "Build the Wall" equivalent).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the gang (MS-13) is described as "notorious for extreme violence and bloodshed," this is presented as factual background information about the gang the subject *claimed* affiliation with, not used to instill fear to support a specific idea or policy. The report itself focuses on the apprehension.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person, group, or institution.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The facts presented (time, location, actions taken, nationality, lack of US criminal record) appear stated neutrally. The description of MS-13's notoriety is a widely accepted characterization, not an obvious exaggeration or minimization in this context.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, national identity, or "us vs. them" sentiment based on nationality or group belonging.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is generally neutral and reportorial. Words like "apprehended," "arrested," "illegally," and "notorious" are factual descriptors in this law enforcement context and lack strong emotional connotations like "outrage" or demonizing stereotypes in the given example.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There are no comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally hated groups to disapprove of an idea.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not suggest that an idea or action is correct or desirable because it is popular.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The report describes a single event (an arrest) and its circumstances. It does not make causal claims about complex events.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text provides specific details (time, location, agency, subject's name, nationality, gang affiliation claim, lack of US record, processing reason). It is not deliberately unclear or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – The text reports actions by authorities (Border Patrol, Yuma PD) but does not use their status *as evidence* to support a specific claim beyond the facts of the arrest they conducted.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text reports a specific incident involving one individual. It does not present a situation with only two possible choices or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking or discussion (e.g., "it is what it is," "end of story").
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the details of the apprehension and processing of the individual. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text reports facts and does not present or refute any arguments.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse anyone of hypocrisy by referencing their past actions or other situations.

**Verdict – 5% – Explanation:** The text reads as a straightforward, factual law enforcement press release. It reports a specific incident: the apprehension of an individual by Border Patrol. It provides concrete details (time, location, subject's name, nationality, observed gang tattoo, self-claimed gang affiliation, lack of US criminal history, reason for processing). The description of MS-13 as "notorious for extreme violence and bloodshed" is a factual characterization widely used by authorities and media when referring to that specific gang and serves as relevant context for the subject's claimed affiliation. While the choice to report *this specific arrest* and highlight the gang connection could be seen as fitting a broader narrative (e.g., about border security or gang threats), the text itself employs neutral, reportorial language and avoids the overt persuasive, manipulative, or emotionally charged techniques defined in the list. It presents verifiable facts about the incident without apparent distortion or the intent to provoke a specific emotional response beyond informing the public about the arrest. The very low likelihood percentage reflects the absence of identifiable propaganda techniques within the text itself, though the context of its publication might be part of a larger communication strategy.
