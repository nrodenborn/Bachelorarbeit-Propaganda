Here is the analysis of the text according to the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used to attack any subject.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message (no new indictments, probe complete) is stated clearly but not excessively repeated beyond the necessary reporting.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to promote an idea.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear about alternatives or consequences.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of Mueller, the probe, or the findings; it reports the conclusion.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The facts presented (no new indictments, probe complete, list of indicted figures) are reported straightforwardly without apparent inflation or downplaying.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – Language is neutral and factual (e.g., "indicted", "pleaded guilty", "investigation is complete"). No emotionally charged words or stereotypes are evident.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No idea is disapproved by linking it to a hated group.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not argue for the validity or acceptance of the findings based on their popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text reports events (end of probe, no new indictments, past indictments) without assigning simple causes to complex situations.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The language is clear and specific ("no new indictments", "investigation is complete", names specific individuals indicted).
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While sources are cited (multiple outlets, senior Justice Dept official, spokeswoman Kerri Kupec), this is standard journalistic attribution to establish the report's veracity. It is not used as evidence *for* a specific claim beyond the factual status of the probe.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents the factual outcome of the probe without framing choices or options, false or otherwise.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used that would shut down critical thinking or discussion about the probe or its findings.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on reporting the conclusion of the Mueller probe and relevant related facts (past indictments). No irrelevant material is introduced.
17. **Straw men** – No – No arguments are presented and refuted within the text.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are made against any opponent.

**Verdict – 2% –** The text is a straightforward news report summarizing the conclusion of the Mueller probe. It attributes its core claims to official sources (Justice Department officials) and established outlets, uses neutral and factual language, and presents specific, verifiable information (e.g., names of individuals who pleaded guilty). There is no discernible attempt to manipulate emotions, distort facts, promote a specific agenda beyond reporting the news, or employ any of the listed propaganda techniques. The extremely low percentage (2%) acknowledges the *potential* for any communication to be framed in a way that subtly serves an interest, but there is no overt evidence of propaganda in this specific text. It functions primarily as informative reporting.
