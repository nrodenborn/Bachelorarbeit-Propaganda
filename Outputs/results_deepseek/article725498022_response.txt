Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text uses insulting labels like "homosexual/pederast predator" for Fernando Karadima and "notorious homosexual" for Monsignor Battista Ricca. Examples: "the charismatic homosexual/pederast predator Fernando Karadima", "his appointment of the notorious homosexual, Monsignor Battista Ricca".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "no evidence" is repeated multiple times regarding the accusations against Bishop Barros, mirroring the Pope's statements and emphasizing this point. Examples: "There is not a single piece of evidence against him", "repeating a claim of ‘no evidence’ against the bishop", "I cannot condemn him if I don’t have – I don’t say proof – but evidence".
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: While phrases like "Zero Tolerance" are mentioned, they are referenced as policy claims rather than used as brief, memorable phrases crafted by the text itself to promote its own message. The text does not introduce its own slogans.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – Explanation: The text criticizes the Pope's actions and the Church's handling of abuse, but it does not primarily attempt to instill fear about the consequences of alternatives to its viewpoint. The focus is on outrage and failure.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text consistently questions the credibility of Pope Francis and his claims regarding the Barros case and his handling of abuse. Examples: "Francis claim that he met with and heard the 'pain' of the victims is untrue", "this claim is not supported by the reality", "Francis has gone to considerable lengths to dismantle the efforts of his predecessor".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text minimizes the sincerity and impact of the Pope's apology by framing it skeptically ("something touted... as a 'contrite' papal apology", "This 'contrite' papal apology didn’t fly well"). It also potentially exaggerates the definitiveness of victim testimonies as absolute proof while downplaying the Pope's insistence on evidence/procedure.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not appeal to patriotism, national identity, or a specific group identity to bolster its argument. Its criticism is directed at Church leadership and specific individuals.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text frequently uses emotionally charged language and negative connotations to shape perception. Examples: "spectacle", "outrages and embarrassments", "slandered abuse survivors", "shameful", "complicit in the cover-up", "damaging", "offensive and painful", "testily and with insults", "foolish", "blow-back", "astonishing public rebuke", "egregious failures", "devastating impact", "slap", "untrue", "sinister appearance", "mafia", "deprioritising", "notorious", "chaos and lack of commitment", "damning statement".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not attempt to disapprove of the Pope's stance by associating it with groups hated by the audience (e.g., Nazis, fascists).
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: While the text cites criticism from various sources (reporters, victims, Cardinal O'Malley, Marie Collins), it does not primarily argue that the Pope is wrong *because* these sources criticize him (an appeal to popularity). It uses their statements as evidence within its own critical narrative.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text presents a complex narrative involving multiple actors, historical context, procedures, and personal relationships (e.g., Errázuriz's role, Vatican reforms under Benedict vs. Francis, the Barros/Karadima connection). It doesn't reduce the entire scandal to one simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is highly specific, naming individuals, quoting statements, citing dates, and detailing events and procedures. It aims for clarity in its accusations, not obscurity.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text cites the rulings and opinions of authorities (secular courts, Vatican tribunals, judges, Cardinal O'Malley, Marie Collins) to validate the victims' claims and undermine the Pope's position. Examples: "deemed credible both by the secular courts and the Vatican tribunal", "ruling of the civil judge", "Sean Cardinal O’Malley... said", "Marie Collins... said".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: The text presents a nuanced, albeit highly critical, view. It details the Pope's apology, acknowledges his "pain and shame" statements (while questioning sincerity), and explores the complexity of the evidence issue and Vatican procedures. It doesn't frame the situation as having only two simplistic options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: The text is argumentative and detailed, inviting the reader to engage with the complexity of the issue and the evidence presented. It does not use simplistic phrases to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text remains tightly focused on the Barros case, the Pope's response to it, the history of the Karadima abuse, and the broader context of Francis's handling of clerical sexual abuse reforms. It does not introduce significant irrelevant material to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text directly addresses the Pope's stated positions and justifications (e.g., "no evidence", meeting victims, punishing abusers) and attempts to refute them with specific counter-evidence and examples. It does not misrepresent his arguments to make them easier to attack.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text focuses criticism squarely on Pope Francis, his allies (Errázuriz), and his actions/inactions regarding the specific case and broader abuse reforms. It does not deflect criticism by accusing his critics of hypocrisy regarding unrelated issues.

**Verdict – 75% –** Explanation: The text exhibits several clear propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority) aimed at discrediting Pope Francis and portraying his actions regarding Bishop Barros and clerical sexual abuse as negligent, dishonest, and part of a pattern of undermining accountability. Its heavy reliance on emotionally charged language (Loaded Language), selective presentation of facts to cast doubt on the Pope's statements (Doubt), minimization of his apology (Exaggeration/Minimization), and use of negative labels (Name Calling) strongly indicate a persuasive intent beyond simple reporting. While it presents specific details, quotes, and historical context that are fact-based, the overall framing, tone, and choice of emphasis are designed to lead the reader to a highly critical conclusion about the Pope. The lack of techniques like Black & White Fallacy or Thought-terminating Clichés shows it maintains some argumentative complexity, preventing a higher percentage. However, the pervasive use of the identified techniques signifies a strong propagandistic intent.
