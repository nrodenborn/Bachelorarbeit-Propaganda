### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:  

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Never-Trumpers" and "Party of Pelosi" are used as derogatory labels to dismiss critics.  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Phrases like "It’s not coming back" and "no turning back" reinforce the irreversible demise of the old GOP.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases are used as standalone slogans (e.g., no equivalents to "Make America Great Again").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings about China’s "expansionist ambitions," refugees, and "humanitarian crisis" instill fear to discredit past policies.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions the credibility of the GOP elite: "Why are the people responsible for these wars still being listened to?"  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates consequences (e.g., "$12 trillion in merchandise trade deficits," China as a "potentially malevolent power") and minimizes context for failures.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No explicit appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotional terms like "hubristic drive," "malevolent power," "bleeding southern border," and "congenital blindness" evoke bias.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazism.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Does not emphasize the popularity of Trump’s ideas to persuade.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames GOP elites solely for complex issues (e.g., China’s rise, Middle East crises) while ignoring other factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are presented directly, without deliberate confusion.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – No authoritative figures are cited as evidence (mentions of Kennan/Reagan are historical references, not proofs).  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents a binary: Failed "Bush party" policies vs. Trump’s "corrections," ignoring middle-ground alternatives.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "case closed" or "end of story" to halt debate.  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – All content relates to criticizing GOP elites; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Criticizes actual policies (e.g., NATO expansion, China trade) without misrepresentation.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Does not deflect by accusing opponents of hypocrisy.

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely propaganda. It employs multiple persuasive techniques—**name-calling**, **loaded language**, **appeal to fear**, **causal oversimplification**, and **black-and-white fallacy**—to vilify the "old GOP" and legitimize Trump’s takeover. It frames complex geopolitical issues (e.g., trade deficits, Cold War policy) as simplistic moral failures of elites, using emotionally charged language ("hubristic," "malevolent," "bleeding border") while dismissing opposing viewpoints as irrelevant ("It’s not coming back"). Though it cites historical events, it selectively omits counter-evidence (e.g., benefits of globalization) to advance a partisan narrative. The goal is not balanced analysis but to galvanize support for Trump by discrediting critics and oversimplifying past failures.
