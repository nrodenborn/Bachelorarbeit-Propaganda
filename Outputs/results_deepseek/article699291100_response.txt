Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation:* No direct insulting labels (e.g., "crooked," "traitor") are applied to the Clintons/Obama. Critical terms like "sordid tale" describe the situation, not the subjects themselves.*

2. **Repetition** – No  
   *Explanation:* Key points (e.g., uranium deal, Clinton Foundation donations) are reiterated but not in an identical, looping manner. The narrative progresses with new details.*

3. **Slogans** – No  
   *Explanation:* No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Lock her up!") are used to summarize the message.*

4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
   *Explanation:* While the topic implies corruption, the text does not explicitly invoke fear of consequences (e.g., "This will destroy America!").*

5. **Doubt** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation:* The text repeatedly questions the credibility of the Clintons/Obama administration, e.g., "transactions that both the Clintons and the Obama administration **denied had any influence**" (implying their denial is untrustworthy).*

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No  
   *Explanation:* Specific figures ($500k, $145mm) and events are cited without clear hyperbole or understatement. The tone is accusatory but not demonstrably exaggerated.*

7. **Flag-Waving** – No  
   *Explanation:* No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or loyalty (e.g., "real Americans," "protect our country").*

8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation:* Emotionally charged terms frame the narrative negatively, e.g., "**sordid tale**," "**racketeering scheme**," "**corruption**," "**threatened** with loss of freedom," implying guilt and oppression.*

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *Explanation:* No association of the Clintons/Obama with universally hated groups (e.g., Nazis, terrorists).*

10. **Bandwagon** – No  
    *Explanation:* No claims like "everyone knows" or "most people agree" to imply popular consensus.*

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation:* Implies donations directly caused State Department approval, ignoring other factors: "**nine shareholders... made $145mm in donations...**" followed by "**the State Department approved the deal**," suggesting a quid pro quo.*

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No  
    *Explanation:* Details are specific (e.g., dollar amounts, timelines, roles). No ambiguous phrasing obscures meaning.*

13. **Appeal to authority** – No  
    *Explanation:* While sources (e.g., lawyers, The Hill) are cited, they aren't presented as unquestionable authorities. Their credibility is not the primary evidence.*

14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation:* Presents a binary narrative: The informant is silenced by a corrupt administration ("**threatened**") versus revealing truth ("**this is wrong**"). Ignores potential complexities or alternate explanations.*

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No  
    *Explanation:* No phrases (e.g., "It is what it is") used to shut down scrutiny. The text invites further inquiry.*

16. **Red herring** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation:* Ends with an irrelevant jab at CNN: "**the ‘journalists’ over at CNN are still trying to get to the bottom of exactly who spent the $100,000 on Facebook ads…**" This distracts from the uranium narrative.*

17. **Straw men** – No  
    *Explanation:* No misrepresentation of opposing arguments. Focuses on the stated allegations.*

18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    *Explanation:* No attempt to deflect criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy (e.g., "But what about Trump?").*

---

**Verdict – 65% –**  
The text exhibits several propaganda techniques (Doubt, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy, Red Herring). It selectively presents allegations against the Clintons/Obama administration as factual while omitting counter-evidence or context (e.g., lack of proof linking donations to the uranium deal's approval). Emotionally charged language ("sordid tale," "threatened") and the irrelevant CNN dig amplify bias. While based on reported events (e.g., The Hill's investigation), its framing, one-sided sourcing (primarily the informant's lawyer), and oversimplification of causality align with persuasive manipulation rather than neutral reporting. However, it avoids the most egregious techniques (e.g., outright fabrication, name-calling), placing it in the realm of highly slanted, agenda-driven narrative rather than pure propaganda.
