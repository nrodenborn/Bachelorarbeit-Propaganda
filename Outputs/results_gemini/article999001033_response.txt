1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes a Gillum staffer defining the candidate’s political beliefs as “part of the crazy crazy crazies” and refers to Florida as a “cracker state,” which is an insulting racial label.
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that the Gillum campaign is “lying to voters” is repeated in the headline, the first paragraph, and in the concluding sentences (“a candidate lying to the voters he needs to win the election,” and “The video evidence confirms that Gillum is lying to Florida voters.”).
3. Slogans – Yes – The text highlights a cynical phrase used by a staffer: “Remember our saying, modern-day fairy tales start with ‘once I am elected,’”.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text aims to create fear that Gillum is hiding a more radical agenda, particularly regarding gun control, stating he would support banning AR-15s but won't say so publicly “cause he’s trying to get the moderates and the gun-toting people in North Florida.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire purpose of the text is to question the credibility of Andrew Gillum and his campaign by presenting evidence that his platform promises “will never happen” and that the campaign “is lying to voters.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of a few staffers' comments, presenting them as definitive proof of the entire campaign's official, albeit secret, strategy and Gillum's personal intentions.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text focuses on a state election and voters but does not use patriotic appeals or symbols to make its case.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “racist statements,” “lying to voters,” “racial slur,” “whip them up into a frenzy,” and “crazy crazy crazies” to evoke a strong emotional response from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or person to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not claim that its view is popular or that the reader should agree because many others do.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause-and-effect: the video was released, therefore, “The video evidence confirms that Gillum is lying to Florida voters.” This ignores the complexities of the situation, such as the context of the recording or the actual authority of the staffers.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents Project Veritas and its president, James O’Keefe, as an authority on uncovering political deception, quoting him to validate the findings and frame them as part of a larger pattern.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice: either Gillum is honest, or this video proves he is a complete liar. It does not allow for nuance, such as the staffers speaking without authority or exaggerating.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The sentence, “The video evidence confirms that Gillum is lying to Florida voters,” is presented as a final, indisputable fact, intended to discourage further critical thought or questioning of the evidence.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text brings up James O’Keefe’s findings in “Missouri, Tennessee and Arizona,” which is irrelevant to the specific claims against Gillum but serves to bolster O’Keefe’s credibility and suggest a widespread pattern, distracting from the specifics of the Florida case.
17. Straw men – Yes – The concluding rhetorical questions (“Will there be wall-to-wall coverage in the media…?”) create a straw man of a biased media that intends to ignore the story, allowing the author to attack this imagined inaction.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy on an unrelated matter.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform objectively but to persuade the audience to adopt a negative view of Andrew Gillum. It achieves this by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques. The piece is framed entirely from the perspective of Project Veritas, an activist organization, rather than a neutral journalistic source. It uses emotionally loaded language, name-calling, and appeals to fear to provoke outrage. It builds its case on an appeal to the authority of the "video evidence" while using causal oversimplification and a black & white fallacy to present its conclusions as absolute and undeniable. The text strategically uses repetition to hammer home its central message ("Gillum is lying") and employs straw man arguments against the media to preemptively discredit any lack of coverage. The sheer number and combination of these techniques demonstrate a deliberate effort to manipulate audience perception rather than engage in balanced reporting.
