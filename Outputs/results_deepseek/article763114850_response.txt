### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "shoddy article," "bogus claims," "ironically named publication Fair Observer," "uninformed, biased and ideologically motivated attack."  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" repeated three times.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Who guards the guardians?" and "Who runs the Internet runs the world."  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "manipulating behavior online and literally controlling how people think," suggesting a threat to free thought and information.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "utterly disingenuous, as it turns out" (regarding VOX-Pol's objectivity), questioning Ganesh's credibility and motives.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: "literally controlling how people think"; Minimization: Dismissing Ganesh's research as "sloppy thinking" and "surmise."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No overt appeal to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Internet Thought Police," "appointed guardians," "manipulating," "stamp out," "heinous crime," "infiltration by the far right."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames Ganesh/Oxford/EU for Tommy Robinson's imprisonment: "Is it simply a coincidence that Tommy Robinson is now in prison...?"  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – "Islamic influence" (unspecified), "reinforcing the lies," and vague claims like "partnership between Europe’s governments... and Islamic influence."  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – The text *undermines* authority (Oxford, EU, Ganesh) rather than citing supportive authorities.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Portrays Ganesh/researchers as manipulative liars vs. Robinson/alt-right as misrepresented victims. Ignores middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Who guards the guardians?" and "Who runs the Internet runs the world" shut down deeper analysis.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Introducing Tommy Robinson's imprisonment and the Rochdale rape gangs distracts from critiquing Ganesh's research.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Misrepresents VOX-Pol as targeting non-violent extremism: "The project... is only interested in violent extremism" (directly contradicted by their quoted mission).  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Deflects criticism of Osborne's attack by emphasizing Muslim rape gangs: "outrage at the behavior of the gangs... caused Osborne to lose his mind."

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It systematically employs multiple propaganda techniques (e.g., Name Calling, Loaded Language, Straw Men, Appeal to Fear) to discredit Bharath Ganesh, Oxford University, and EU-funded research. It presents a one-sided narrative that vilifies opponents while portraying Tommy Robinson as a victim, using emotional language ("thought police," "controlling how people think") and conspiracy-adjacent rhetoric ("partnership with Islamic influence"). While it cites factual elements (e.g., Ganesh’s affiliation with Tell MAMA), these are framed to imply nefarious intent without evidence. The goal is clearly to manipulate readers into distrusting academic and governmental efforts to counter extremism, rather than offering balanced critique.**
