1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the word "LIED" in reference to the authorities, which is an insulting label meant to attack their credibility. Example: "Confirmed: Authorities LIED About Las Vegas Shooter’s Hotel Check-In Date" and "The photo even has a handwritten note that was reportedly written by an FBI agent – proving that the FBI specifically lied to the country."
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that authorities are lying or hiding information is repeated throughout the text. Example: The word "lied" or "misled" appears multiple times, and the question "What Else Are They Hiding?" from the title is thematically echoed in the conclusion: "This throws their entire narrative into question and makes one wonder what else is being hidden from the public?"
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear and suspicion about a potential cover-up by official institutions. Example: "This throws their entire narrative into question and makes one wonder what else is being hidden from the public?"
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to cast doubt on the credibility of the official investigation and the authorities conducting it. Example: "Confirmed: Authorities LIED About Las Vegas Shooter’s Hotel Check-In Date – What Else Are They Hiding?"
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the certainty and implications of its findings. Example: "photographic evidence from inside the hotel parking garage has confirmed that the FBI, along with state and local police, specifically lied about key details of the shooting." This presents a discrepancy as definitive proof of a deliberate, coordinated lie, which is an exaggeration of what the evidence shows.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text makes a subtle appeal to patriotism by framing the issue as authorities deceiving the nation. Example: "...proves that authorities have directly lied to the American people about the case at least once..."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's perception. Example: "Shockingly, another Tweet by Loomer also revealed...", "horrific shooting", "bizarre interviews".
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that a growing movement of people disbelieves the official story. Example: "Over the last few days the alternative media has spent countless hours conducting their own investigations..." and "many different theories have been put forth that counter the mainstream narrative."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text assumes a simple, malicious cause (a deliberate lie) for a complex situation (discrepancies in a chaotic, ongoing investigation). Example: "The picture “proves FBI misled public about #StephenPaddock‘s check in date,” Loomer Tweeted." This simplifies the situation by ruling out error or preliminary information being updated.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – While presenting its own points as clear, it introduces other conspiracies vaguely to create a general sense of unease without needing to provide evidence for them. Example: "From reports of multiple shooters to officials seemingly covering up the ISIS connection, many different theories have been put forth..."
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses unofficial sources as authorities to validate its claims. Example: "new information released by investigative reporter Laura Loomer proves that authorities have directly lied..." and "the Drudge Report even linked to an article asking them directly."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two possibilities: either the official narrative is perfect, or it is a deliberate lie, ignoring the possibility of mistakes or evolving information. Example: "at this point literally every piece of so-called evidence put forth by authorities and then regurgitated by the mainstream media cannot be trusted and should be considered as disinformation until proven otherwise."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces an irrelevant detail to increase the sense of general strangeness and suspicion, distracting from the main point. Example: "It is also important to note that Paddock’s brother Eric has conducted a series of bizarre interviews that have led to even more questions..."
17. Straw men – No – The text attacks the official narrative directly with what it claims is evidence, rather than misrepresenting and refuting a specific argument that wasn't made.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse its opponents of hypocrisy by pointing to their own past actions.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to objectively inform but to persuade the reader to distrust official institutions (the FBI, police) and embrace a conspiracy theory. It achieves this by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques. The piece is built on a foundation of **Doubt** and **Appeal to Fear**, using **Loaded Language** ("LIED," "Hiding") and **Name Calling** to create an emotional response of outrage. It establishes a **Black & White Fallacy** where any discrepancy in the official story is proof of a malicious cover-up, a form of **Causal Oversimplification**. It bolsters its own credibility through **Appeal to Authority** (citing an "investigative reporter" and a news aggregator) while simultaneously creating a **Bandwagon** effect by referencing the "alternative media." The constant **Repetition** of the core message that authorities are lying, combined with **Red Herrings** like the brother's interviews, works to solidify a narrative of widespread conspiracy. The cumulative effect of these techniques is a powerful piece of persuasion designed to manipulate public opinion rather than present a balanced view of the facts.
