7. Flag-Waving – No – Explanation: The text does not use patriotic appeals or references to national identity to support its argument.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation: The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – Explanation: The text implies that its viewpoint is widely held by informed people with the phrase “Of course, anyone who paid attention was aware…” and by quoting Trump’s tweet, “the world is watching, and they get it completely.”

17. Straw men – Yes – Explanation: The text misrepresents the argument for Russian interference by reducing it to just “a couple hundred thousand dollars of ad spends and some Russian bots,” a simplified version that is easier to attack and dismiss.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – Explanation: The entire premise of the article is a form of whataboutism. It deflects from the issue of Russian interference in the 2016 election by changing the subject to “what about” Google’s alleged actions on behalf of the Clinton campaign.

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint. This is achieved through the dense and deliberate use of a wide array of propaganda techniques.

The article immediately frames the issue using a **Black & White Fallacy** and a **Straw Man**, presenting the widely reported Russian interference as a trivial "notion" while positioning its own claims as the "real 'collusion'". This is a classic propaganda tactic to control the narrative from the outset. It heavily relies on **Whataboutism** to deflect from one issue by pointing to an alleged transgression by the other side.

Throughout the piece, **Loaded Language** ("disgraced," "spy," "colluded") and **Appeals to Fear** (regarding privacy and election integrity) are used to manipulate the reader's emotions. It bolsters its claims by **Appealing to Authority** figures who are popular with its target audience (Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump). Finally, it uses techniques like **Red Herring** to introduce unrelated grievances and **Thought-Terminating Clichés** to discourage critical thinking. The sheer volume and combination of these techniques show a clear intent to manipulate opinion rather than present a factual, balanced report.
