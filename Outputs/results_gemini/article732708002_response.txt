1. Name calling – Yes – The text reports that the Pope used an insulting label: "The pope has stuck by Barros, dismissing the protesters as “lefties”..."
2. Repetition – No – The text covers a single topic, but it does not repeat the same message or phrase in a propagandistic way.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea. The slogans at the end are for subscribing to the publication, not part of the article's argument.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text describes past events that are frightening (child abuse) but does not use fear to advocate for a particular idea over an alternative.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively questions the credibility and effectiveness of the Vatican's efforts: "critics have accused Francis and his two predecessors... of failing to aggressively weed out and punish predator priests," and "Was the pope listening? Possibly not."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text quotes a former member using exaggeration to make a point about the commission's ineffectiveness: "He said the group was a toothless, paper-shuffling exercise."
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or a collective identity to persuade the audience.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to describe the situation, such as "predator priests," "molesters and rapists," and "great pain.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or person to a group hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text reports on the effect of popular protest but does not argue that an idea is correct simply because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text explores the multiple complex reasons for the commission's struggles, avoiding a single, simple cause.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text aims to clarify a complex issue, not confuse the audience with vague language.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text quotes authorities, but it often uses their statements to show conflict or question their actions, rather than as unquestionable proof of a claim.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text presents a nuanced situation with multiple viewpoints and factors, not a simple choice between two options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on the central topic of the abuse commission and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract.
17. Straw men – No – The text engages with the real arguments and conflicts involved, rather than misrepresenting and refuting a weaker, unstated argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 15% – The text is a piece of critical journalism, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about a complex and controversial issue by providing context, quoting multiple sources, and presenting evidence. While it uses techniques that can be found in propaganda, such as Loaded Language and casting Doubt, their use here is consistent with journalistic reporting on a sensitive and serious topic. The emotionally charged words are accurate descriptors of the crimes, and the doubt cast upon the Vatican is substantiated by the evidence presented in the article (e.g., resignations, ignored requests, failed initiatives). The text reports on others using propaganda (Name Calling) rather than employing it directly to manipulate the audience. Therefore, it has a very low likelihood of being propaganda.
