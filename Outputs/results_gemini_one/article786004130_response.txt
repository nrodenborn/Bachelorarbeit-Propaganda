Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack the officer or any other subject. It refers to her by her name and title.

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.

Appeal to fear – No – The text reports on a frightening event but does not use fear to support an idea against alternatives.

Doubt – Yes – The author explicitly questions the credibility of the officer's story. Example: "I have no idea how you can enter an apartment mistakenly." and "Ok, some of this seems plausible, but I still am left wondering about the door being ajar."

Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text reports facts from police statements and news reports without obvious exaggeration or minimization by the author.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses language designed to appeal to emotions and a sense of injustice. Example: "In any case, we all know that any of us who did the same thing would have immediately been taken into custody."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that the reader should share a feeling of outrage because it is a widespread reaction. Example: "Knowing this provoked outrage across the nation over the weekend."

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not assume a simple cause for a complex event; instead, it presents various details from an affidavit.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's commentary seeks to question vagueness in the official report rather than being vague itself.

Appeal to authority – No – The text cites official sources like the police and the District Attorney's Office for information, which is a standard journalistic practice, not a propaganda technique of using an authority's opinion as unquestionable proof.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present only two options. It explores the details of the situation as reported.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases that discourage critical thought; in fact, the author's interjections encourage it.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a completely irrelevant poll to distract from the main topic. Example: "take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?"

Straw men – No – The text does not refute an argument that was not presented by an opponent.

Whataboutism – No – The text mentions a prior shooting involving the same officer, but this is presented as relevant background information, not as a way to charge an opponent with hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 75% – The text is a hybrid of factual news reporting and propaganda. While it conveys a significant amount of verifiable information by quoting official police statements, affidavits, and other news outlets, it strategically embeds several propaganda techniques to shape the reader's opinion. The author uses Doubt to question the official narrative, Loaded Language ("we all know...") to create an "us vs. them" mentality, and the Bandwagon technique ("outrage across the nation") to encourage the reader to adopt a popular viewpoint. The most blatant evidence of propagandistic intent is the use of a Red Herring—a completely unrelated political poll is inserted multiple times, distracting from the article and likely serving an ulterior motive such as data collection or pushing a separate agenda. These elements show a clear intent to do more than just inform, aiming instead to provoke outrage and steer the reader toward a specific conclusion about injustice and police privilege.
