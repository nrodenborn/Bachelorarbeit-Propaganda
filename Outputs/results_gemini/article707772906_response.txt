18.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. It utilizes a vast majority (16 out of 18) of the listed techniques to construct a persuasive and emotionally manipulative narrative. The article uses the specific, factual allegations against Al Franken as a starting point, or "hook," to launch a much broader attack on political opponents and institutions. It employs Loaded Language ("cesspool," "filth") to generate outrage, then uses Red Herring and Whataboutism to pivot from Franken to Bill Clinton and Joe Biden, aiming to discredit the entire Democratic party. The argument is framed using a Black & White Fallacy, presenting the only solution as electing "anti-establishment candidates" and using slogans like "drain the swamp" to simplify complex issues. The ultimate goal is not merely to inform the reader about Al Franken, but to shape their worldview, stoke anger at a perceived corrupt establishment, and ultimately solicit political and financial support for the author's own cause.
