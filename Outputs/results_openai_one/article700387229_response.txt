### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 80% –**  
The text exhibits several classic propaganda techniques: appeal to fear, repetition, slogans, exaggeration, loaded language, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. The repeated use of emotionally charged phrases like “no one is safe” and “much more dangerous,” combined with authoritative quotes and a focus on worst-case scenarios, strongly suggest an intent to alarm and influence the reader’s perception of the situation. While the article does present factual information and quotes from experts, the framing and language choices are designed to maximize fear and urgency, which is characteristic of propaganda. Therefore, there is a high likelihood (80%) that this text is propaganda, primarily due to its emotional manipulation and exaggeration of risk.
