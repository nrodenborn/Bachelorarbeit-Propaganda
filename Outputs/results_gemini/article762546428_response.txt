***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative view of public education and a positive view of homeschooling. This is achieved through the heavy use of numerous propaganda techniques. The article relies extensively on loaded language ("seethe," "brainwashing," "collectivist agenda") and name-calling ("leftist social engineering") to create an immediate emotional bias. It employs the appeal to fear by constantly linking public schools with "violence," "shootings," and "bullying." The argument is built on a black & white fallacy, presenting only the "absolute horror" of public schools versus the implied safety of homeschooling, while ignoring any other options or nuances. It uses a bandwagon appeal by emphasizing "skyrocketing" numbers to suggest an inevitable and correct trend. Furthermore, the text engages in causal oversimplification by blaming a complex phenomenon entirely on a few select issues. The inclusion of a broad anti-government screed at the end serves as a red herring, distracting from the core topic to push a wider ideology. While it cites sources and quotes individuals (appeal to authority), these are used selectively to reinforce its one-sided narrative. The sheer density of these techniques indicates a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than engage in a balanced, factual discussion.
