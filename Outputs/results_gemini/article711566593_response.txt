1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Jose Ines Garcia Zarate with insulting labels such as “criminal illegal” and “career criminal.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the defendant’s status as a “Mexican national,” a “criminal,” and an “illegal” immigrant to reinforce a negative association with his identity and the verdict.

3. Slogans – Yes – The title, “No Justice for Kate Steinle,” acts as a brief and memorable phrase that encapsulates the article's entire argument.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that as a result of this verdict, a criminal can “literally get away with murder in broad daylight,” and that this will give “new meaning to the cry of ‘no justice, no peace’,” instilling fear about public safety and future unrest.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the defendant’s identity by stating, “Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, or whatever his real name is,” and casts doubt on the entire legal process in San Francisco by calling the defense’s arguments “politically correct nonsense.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the outcome by stating the defendant can “literally get away with murder,” which is false as he was acquitted of that specific charge, not found innocent of all wrongdoing (he was convicted of a felony).

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national identity by highlighting that the defense attorney was “funded by American taxpayers” and framing the issue as a failure to enforce “U.S. immigration law.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language such as “disgraceful verdict,” “heartbreaking death,” “criminal aliens,” and “politically correct nonsense” to influence the reader's emotions.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by suggesting it is popular with a group like the Nazis or a similarly hated group.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text quotes President Trump’s tweet, “No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration,” which appeals to the idea that this anger is a widespread and popular sentiment.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex event by quoting Jeff Sessions, who claimed San Francisco’s sanctuary city policy “led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle,” ignoring the multiple factors involved in the incident and trial.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text’s argument is direct and its accusations are clear; it does not use intentionally vague language to confuse the audience.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on quotes from authorities who support its viewpoint, such as President Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and conservative commentators to lend credibility to its argument.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice between justice for Kate Steinle (and by extension, America) and the politically motivated protection of “criminal aliens,” as stated by Ben Shapiro: “Politics trumps evidence in California once again.”

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “politically correct nonsense” is used to dismiss the defense’s arguments without engaging with them, discouraging critical thought about their legal basis.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the irrelevant fact that the defense attorney was “Ralph Nader’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election” to distract from the legal arguments and frame him as a political actor.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an oversimplified version of the defense’s argument, framing a verdict based on due process as a simple desire to let a criminal go free, which it calls a “vindication for the rights of immigrants” in a mocking tone.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text reports the use of this technique by the defense attorney, Matt Gonzalez, who deflects criticism from the President and Attorney General by pointing out, “they are themselves under investigation by a special prosecutor.”

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to provide a neutral, factual account of the trial and verdict, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly critical viewpoint. This is achieved through the overwhelming use of propaganda techniques. The piece employs 16 of the 18 listed techniques, including name-calling (“criminal illegal”), appeal to fear (he can “literally get away with murder”), causal oversimplification (blaming the sanctuary city policy for the death), and a strong appeal to authority by selectively quoting figures who share the author's opinion (Trump, Sessions, Shapiro). The language is consistently loaded with emotional and stereotypical phrases. The title itself, "No Justice for Kate Steinle," sets a biased frame from the outset. By consistently de-emphasizing the legal arguments of the case in favor of focusing on the defendant's immigration status and criminal history, the text constructs a narrative designed to provoke anger and advance a political agenda against sanctuary cities and immigration.
