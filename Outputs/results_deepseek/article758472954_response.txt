Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against China or other entities.  
2. **Repetition** – No – The core message is stated once without deliberate repetition.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Make America Safe") are used.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The warning about "abnormal sensations of sound and pressure" and references to brain injuries aim to instill vigilance/fear. Example: *"Beware sonic weapon attacks"* and *"diagnosed with a mild traumatic brain injury"*.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No direct questioning of credibility (e.g., of China or medical reports).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Descriptions like "mild traumatic brain injury" and "subtle and vague" sensations are measured, not exaggerated/minimized.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – No – Language is clinical (e.g., "abnormal sensations," "diagnosed") without emotional or stereotypical triggers.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No associations with hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified cause (e.g., "sonic attacks" are presented as a hypothesis, not a confirmed cause).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Descriptions like "subtle and vague, but abnormal" clarify uncertainty; no deliberate confusion.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Pompeo's statement lends credibility. Example: *"Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said that medical teams were travelling..."* and *"he [Pompeo] said"* the symptoms were consistent with Cuba.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomies (e.g., no "us vs. them" framing).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases that shut down discussion (e.g., "case closed").  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions; the Cuba comparison is directly relevant.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy.  

**Verdict – 30% –** The text primarily reports facts (e.g., the embassy warning, the employee’s diagnosis, Pompeo’s response) with minimal propagandistic intent. However, it includes an *appeal to fear* (warning of potential attacks/injuries) and *appeal to authority* (Pompeo’s statements), which subtly frame the issue as credible and urgent. The Cuba parallel amplifies unease but isn’t manipulative on its own. Overall, the tone is informational, not overtly persuasive, and lacks multiple hallmark propaganda techniques. The low percentage reflects its basis in documented events rather than systematic manipulation.
