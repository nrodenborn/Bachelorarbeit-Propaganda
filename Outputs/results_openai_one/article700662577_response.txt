**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict – 60% –**  
The text employs several propaganda techniques, notably repetition, appeal to fear, exaggeration, loaded language, and appeal to authority. These techniques serve to dramatize the situation and evoke a strong emotional response from the reader. However, the text also provides factual details, quotes from officials, and specific statistics, which are characteristic of standard journalistic reporting. The presence of propaganda techniques suggests a moderate likelihood that the text is intended to persuade and emotionally influence the audience rather than simply inform. Therefore, while the text contains elements of propaganda, it is not purely propagandistic and retains significant informational value.
