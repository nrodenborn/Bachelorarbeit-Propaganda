***

Verdict – 85% – The text is a news article that is almost entirely dedicated to reporting on a statement from Donald Trump. This statement is heavily propagandistic, employing multiple techniques simultaneously. The central message relies on **Name calling** and **Slogans** ("Russian Witch Hunt Hoax") to create a negative emotional reaction, which also serves as a **Thought-terminating cliché** to shut down discussion. It uses **Causal Oversimplification** to place the blame for a complex event entirely on one person's action ("all because Jeff Sessions..."). It also uses **Exaggeration** ("so many lives ruined") and is fundamentally an exercise in creating **Doubt** about the legitimacy of the special counsel's investigation. While the article itself is reporting the news, its content is composed almost entirely of these propagandistic statements, making the text a direct vehicle for propaganda.
