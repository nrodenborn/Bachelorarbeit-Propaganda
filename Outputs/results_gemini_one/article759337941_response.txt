Name calling – Yes – The text attacks the Democratic party and individuals with insulting labels such as “criminal, treasonous and sleazy,” and refers to the IT aide as a “jihadi” and part of a group of “Muslim spies.”

Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is repeated three times in a row to reinforce the message that Democrats are corrupt.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses the brief and memorable phrase “jihad-treason” to create a powerful and negative association.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by claiming that a “jihadi” was given “unfettered access to national security secrets” and that this represents “the biggest story of treason and espionage in the recent memory.”

Doubt – Yes – The text opens by questioning the official narrative with the single word “Accidentally?” followed by “Color me skeptical,” immediately casting doubt on the credibility of the Capitol Police's actions.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of the events by calling them “the biggest story of treason and espionage in the recent memory.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a matter of “national security secrets” and “treason,” implying that the Democratic party is acting against the interests of the nation.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like “criminal, treasonous and sleazy,” “jihadi,” “nefarious purposes,” and “Soviet fictions” to provoke a strong emotional response from the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of the opposition's alleged actions by comparing them to a hated group, stating they “toil in Soviet fictions,” which draws a parallel to the Soviet Union.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text uses a poll (“take our poll”) to create the impression that many people are concerned about Democratic corruption and that the reader should join in this popular opinion.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a complex legal and political situation as a simple case of “The Democrat leadership collusion with Muslim spies,” ignoring other potential factors or complexities.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and explicit in its accusations rather than being intentionally vague or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites various sources to appear credible, such as “Luke Rosiak,” “The Daily Caller News Foundation,” the “House IG,” and concludes with “Article posted with permission from Pamela Geller.”

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a binary choice: either you believe the author's narrative of a vast treasonous conspiracy by Democrats, or you accept the official story, which the text portrays as an obvious lie. There is no middle ground offered. Example: "The Democrats are criminal, treasonous and sleazy."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The statement “The Democrats are criminal, treasonous and sleazy” is presented as a simple, inarguable fact that discourages any deeper analysis or discussion of the party's actions.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the irrelevant idea that Democrats are distracted by “titillating porn stories” to divert attention from the specific facts of the case and instead paint a picture of general moral decay.

Straw men – Yes – The text begins by attacking the claim that the evidence was given over “Accidentally,” refuting this single word as if it represents the entirety of the official explanation, thereby misrepresenting the opposing position to make it easier to attack.

Whataboutism – No – The text focuses on direct accusations against its target and does not attempt to deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. It is not designed to inform but to persuade and indoctrinate the reader into a specific, highly partisan viewpoint. It achieves this by employing an overwhelming number of propaganda techniques simultaneously. The piece uses emotionally charged name-calling ("jihadi," "treasonous") and loaded language to bypass rational thought and provoke an immediate negative reaction. It builds a narrative of extreme danger and conspiracy through appeals to fear ("unfettered access to national security secrets") and exaggeration ("biggest story of treason"). The author relentlessly casts doubt on official accounts ("Accidentally?") while presenting a simplistic black-and-white worldview of good versus evil. The use of repetition, appeals to authority (partisan ones), and red herrings further serves to manipulate the reader. The cumulative effect of these techniques is a powerful piece of persuasive writing that abandons objectivity in favor of advancing a political agenda.
