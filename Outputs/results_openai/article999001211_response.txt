Verdict – 70% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, such as name-calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, and black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to influence the reader's perception of the situation involving Jim Acosta, Judge Kelly, and the White House's response. The presence of these techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is propaganda, as it aims to sway opinion through emotional and rhetorical means rather than presenting a balanced and factual account.
