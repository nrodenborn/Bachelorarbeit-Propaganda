6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates implications: "netting Clintons millions" (implying direct profit) while minimizing lack of evidence.

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases halting debate.

### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text exhibits **high likelihood of propaganda** due to:  
1. **Selective Framing**: Focuses exclusively on alleged Clinton/Obama corruption while ignoring exonerating context (e.g., CFIUS’s unanimous approval, lack of evidence linking donations to the deal).  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language ("threatened," "corruption") and fear appeals (Russian control of uranium) dominate.  
3. **Omission of Counter-Evidence**: Fails to note investigations (e.g., 2015 House report) finding no illegal activity by Clinton.  
4. **Source Bias**: Relies on partisan outlets (Zero Hedge, The Hill’s John Solomon) and anonymous sources ("Confidential Source 1").  
5. **Logical Fallacies**: Causal oversimplification (donations = approval) and red herrings (CNN distraction).  
6. **Political Agenda**: Clearly targets Democrats/Clintons, aligning with conservative media narratives.  

While based on real events (Uranium One deal), the text amplifies unproven allegations, uses manipulative techniques, and omits key facts to advance a specific narrative—hallmarks of propaganda. The 15% uncertainty reflects the existence of underlying factual events, though presented deceptively.
