**Verdict – 5% –**  
The text is a straightforward law enforcement report detailing an arrest at the border. It presents specific facts (stolen vehicle, seized weapons/drugs, jurisdictional handover) without emotional language, exaggeration, or persuasive framing. While *any* reporting about border security *could* be used propagandistically in context, this excerpt alone lacks intent to manipulate. The 5% reflects a minimal possibility of implicit bias via selective reporting (e.g., emphasizing border crime without broader context), but it does not actively employ any defined propaganda techniques.
