Here's the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Desperate Feinstein" (insulting label)
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Triplicate poll question: "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" repeated verbatim
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No explicit threat or fear instilled
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "it's incredible the amount of hypocrisy", questioning Feinstein's credibility
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "ridiculous" (minimizing 30-year-old claim), "nothing more than a last minute gambit" (minimizing allegation)
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeal to patriotism
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "hypocrisy", "antics", "ridiculous", "gambit", "political theater", "corrupt DOJ and FBI" (emotionally charged terms)

10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No complex event oversimplified
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Quoting Cornyn and FBI statements to validate arguments
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Implied dichotomy: Feinstein's actions are purely political theater vs. legitimate concerns
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases ending discussion
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introducing Vince Foster cover-up (irrelevant to Kavanaugh allegations)
17. **Straw men** – Yes – "He's a precedence man! He's said it over and over!" (misrepresents Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy)
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – "...remaining silent on two women who have accused Rep. Keith Ellison..." (accusing Feinstein of hypocrisy regarding other cases)

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits extensive use of propaganda techniques including name-calling, repetition, loaded language, whataboutism, straw man arguments, and red herring distractions. It frames Feinstein's actions as hypocritical "antics" while minimizing allegations against Kavanaugh as "ridiculous" and a "gambit." The consistent use of emotionally charged language ("desperate," "corrupt," "political theater") and diversionary tactics (Ellison/Foster references) demonstrate a clear intent to manipulate perception rather than engage in balanced discourse. While containing factual elements (e.g., FBI referral process), the overwhelming rhetorical strategy aligns with propaganda objectives to discredit opponents and shield Kavanaugh through multiple coordinated techniques.
