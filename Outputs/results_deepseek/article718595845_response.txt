### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "lies" (in the title: "The US Is Blatantly Telling Lies"), "disingenuously" (accusing Haley of omitting facts).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No single phrase or idea is repeated excessively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans (e.g., "Buy Gold" is unrelated to the argument).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Ritter’s analysis warns of U.S. military vulnerability against "sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles" from Iran/North Korea, implying catastrophic failure.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Haley’s credibility: "Did she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit... or fail to read the entire UN report?"  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes Iran’s role: "no evidence" of direct arms supply (per UN panel), while exaggerating U.S. hypocrisy ("armed ISIS").  
7. **Flag-waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or identity; criticizes U.S. actions instead.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Blatantly telling lies," "demonize," "grandiose speech," "trumped-up charges" evoke moral outrage.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Complexity of missile origins is acknowledged (Soviet/N. Korean sources, Iranian modifications).  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Arguments are detailed and cited (e.g., Ritter’s technical breakdown).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Relies on Scott Ritter (ex-inspector) and UN experts to debunk Haley.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Recognizes nuance (e.g., UN report findings are dissected, not oversimplified).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "end of story" to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – Stays focused on disproving Haley’s claims about Iranian missiles.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Accurately quotes and refutes Haley’s specific assertions.  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Distracts from Iran’s actions by highlighting U.S. arming of ISIS/al-Qaeda: "doesn’t excuse the U.S. for... arming al-Qaeda’s affiliate."

### Verdict – 80% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Persuasive Agenda**: It systematically discredits U.S. claims about Iran using loaded language ("lies," "demonize") while downplaying Iran’s role.  
2. **Selective Evidence**: Cites sources (Ritter, UN panel) supporting its narrative but ignores counter-evidence. Uses "whataboutism" to deflect criticism of Iran.  
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded terms ("hypocritical," "schizophrenic") and appeals to fear (U.S. military vulnerability) sway readers emotionally.  
4. **Source Bias**: Relies heavily on Scott Ritter (a known critic of U.S. foreign policy) without acknowledging potential bias.  
5. **Omission of Context**: Fails to address why the U.S. might distrust Iran (e.g., nuclear program, regional proxy conflicts), framing U.S. actions as baseless.  
However, it avoids outright falsehoods by citing verifiable sources (UN reports) and providing technical details. The 20% uncertainty stems from its factual citations, but the **overall framing is polemical and one-sided**, aligning with anti-U.S. propaganda objectives.
