1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses scare quotes to label the staff at CNN as “‘journalists’”, a form of name-calling that implies they are not legitimate in their profession.
2. Repetition – Yes – The central claim that the Clintons and their foundation received large sums of money ($145 million in donations, $500,000 in speaking fees) in connection with the approval of the Uranium One deal is stated multiple times throughout the text.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text references “Clinton Cash,” the title of a documentary, which functions as a brief and memorable phrase to encapsulate the entire narrative of alleged corruption.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by stating that the deal gave “Russia ownership of 20% of U.S. uranium assets,” implying a significant threat to American national security that was approved due to corruption.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text is constructed to cast doubt on the credibility of the Clintons, the Obama administration, and the “mainstream media,” for example by stating, “While the mainstream media has largely ignored it…”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the 2016 election interference investigation by sarcastically reducing it to a question of “who spent the $100,000 on Facebook ads,” while simultaneously framing the Uranium One story as a massive, overlooked scandal.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The article appeals to patriotism by focusing on the strategic importance of “America’s uranium reserves” and the danger of these assets falling under the control of Russia.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “sordid tale,” “corruption,” “bribery,” “extortion,” and “threatened” to create a negative impression and guide the reader’s emotional response.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not claim the idea is popular. Instead, it frames the story as a contrarian truth that the “mainstream media has largely ignored.”
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simplified cause-and-effect narrative: The Clintons received millions of dollars, and as a direct result, the State Department approved the Uranium One deal, ignoring the complexities of the multi-agency CFIUS approval process.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague sourcing such as “Sources told The Hill” and an anonymous informant known only as “Confidential Source 1,” which makes the specific claims difficult to independently verify.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text establishes the credibility of the informant’s lawyer, Victoria Toensing, by listing her credentials as a “former Reagan Justice Department official and former chief counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee” to make her claims seem more authoritative.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The narrative implicitly presents only two options: either you believe this story of massive corruption, or you are aligned with the “mainstream media” that is covering it up, leaving no room for nuanced interpretations or alternative explanations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The final sentence dismissing the work of CNN “‘journalists’” is a sarcastic cliché intended to shut down consideration of other ongoing investigations by framing them as trivial and absurd.
16. Red herring – Yes – The final sentence introduces the unrelated topic of Russian Facebook ad spending to distract from the article’s subject and pivot to an attack on a media outlet (CNN).
17. Straw men – Yes – The text creates a straw man of the Russia investigation by misrepresenting it as being solely about “$100,000 on Facebook ads,” an oversimplification that is easy to mock and dismiss.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text uses whataboutism by deflecting from the topic of the 2016 election investigation and redirecting focus with the charge: “What about the Uranium One scandal that the media is ignoring?”

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. It is not a neutral presentation of facts but a persuasive piece designed to promote a specific political narrative. The article systematically employs a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques to construct its argument. It uses loaded language, repetition, and appeals to fear and patriotism to create an emotional and urgent tone. It establishes a simple good-versus-evil narrative through causal oversimplification and a black & white fallacy, casting the Clintons and the Obama administration as corrupt villains. The piece builds its own credibility through appeals to authority while simultaneously seeking to destroy the credibility of any opposing viewpoint (the "mainstream media," the FBI, the Justice Department) through doubt, name-calling, and whataboutism. The sourcing is intentionally vague, and the conclusion uses a red herring and a straw man to dismiss competing narratives. The cumulative effect is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a conspiratorial worldview and a specific political allegiance.
