Here's the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – The text uses descriptive terms like "autocratic Saudi leadership" and "prominent critic," but these are presented as factual descriptors or attributed statements (like Turkish media reports), not direct insults used as the primary attack by the author.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message about the meeting, lack of breakthrough, and the allegations about Khashoggi are stated consistently but not excessively repeated in a propagandistic manner.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to rally support or encapsulate a viewpoint within the text (e.g., no "Justice for Jamal!" or "Stand with Saudi!").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the details of Khashoggi's alleged murder are disturbing and could evoke fear, the text reports these details as allegations (Turkish media reports, critics' views) rather than using them explicitly to instill fear to support a specific policy or action advocated by the author.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text expresses skepticism towards Saudi claims ("Saudi officials insisted... but have provided no video or other evidence"), but this is presented as reporting on the lack of evidence supporting their statement, not as the author's primary technique to undermine credibility without basis.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text reports allegations (dismemberment, bone saw) and counter-statements (accidental death, rogue killers) without clear authorial exaggeration or minimization. It presents differing perspectives.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – While the importance of the US-Saudi alliance is mentioned ("important allies," "crucial regional ally"), it's reported as part of the diplomatic context and statements by officials (Prince Mohammed, Pompeo), not used by the author to invoke patriotism or identity to sway opinion on the Khashoggi issue itself.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – The words "delicate talks," "growing suspicions," "diplomatic crisis," "alleged shocking death," "dismembered," "bone saw," "cover-up," "frayed," "scrambled," "face-saving," and "punitive sanctions" carry strong connotations that evoke specific emotions (concern, suspicion, horror, distrust, pressure) beyond neutral description. *Example:* "Turkish media reports... have said Khashoggi was beaten to death and then dismembered in the building. A 15-member Saudi military team had entered the consulate with a bone saw..."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or universally reviled groups are made to disapprove of an idea.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text reports on demands by "many members of Congress" but doesn't frame this popularity as a primary reason the audience should agree.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text presents the crisis as complex, involving diplomatic relations, regional strategy (Iran, Israel/Palestinians), arms deals, and domestic political pressure, not attributing it to a single simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The reporting is clear and direct about the events, allegations, statements, and context. There's no deliberate obscurity.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While statements from officials (Pompeo, Nauert, Trump, Saudi officials) are reported, the text doesn't present any single authority's statement as definitive proof to end the discussion. It includes conflicting statements and perspectives.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents multiple perspectives and complexities (Saudi denials vs. Turkish reports, Trump's "rogue killers" theory vs. critics, the tension between the crisis and broader strategic goals). It doesn't reduce the situation to only two stark choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No simplistic phrases are used to shut down critical thinking (e.g., "It's just politics," "That's the way it is," "Trust the plan").
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the Khashoggi case, the diplomatic meetings, the allegations, and the potential consequences. Mentions of the broader US-Saudi relationship (oil, Iran, Israel) are directly relevant context, not irrelevant distractions.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text accurately represents the positions it discusses: Saudi denials, Turkish allegations, Trump's "rogue killers" suggestion, critics' accusations of a cover-up, Congressional demands. It doesn't misrepresent a position to make it easier to refute.
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – The mention of Trump's avoided military service serves to highlight potential hypocrisy in his stance on North Korea, implicitly charging him with inconsistency. *Example:* "President Trump —who himself avoided national military service in the 1960’s— keeps beating the war drums over North Korea."

**Verdict – 15% – Explanation:** The text is overwhelmingly a straightforward news report from the Los Angeles Times detailing a diplomatic mission, allegations surrounding a missing journalist, and the complex political context. It relies on attributed sources (officials, media reports, critics) and presents multiple perspectives. While it employs **Loaded Language** to convey the gravity and disturbing nature of the allegations (which is common in reporting serious events) and includes a brief instance of **Whataboutism** regarding Trump's past, these elements do not dominate the piece or transform it into propaganda. The primary function is informative reporting, not persuasion through systematic use of manipulative techniques. The 15% acknowledges the presence of emotionally charged language and the single tangential point about Trump's past, but confirms the core is journalistic reporting.
