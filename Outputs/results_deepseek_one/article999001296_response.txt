### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "pro-jihad Marxist Democrat" (insulting label for a political opponent).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No significant repetition of identical phrases beyond the poll question (which is not central to the core text).  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., no equivalent to "BUILD THE WALL").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "They are insane in their lust for power, and will destroy even our democratic system to get it" (instills fear about Democrats undermining democracy).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Republicans have pointed to embattled Broward Elections chief Brenda Snipes’ record of past election gaffes in arguing that the largely Democratic country is tilted against them — perhaps fraudulently so" (questions credibility of election integrity).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "The Democrats are committing voter fraud on a massive scale" (exaggerates scope without conclusive evidence).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "insane in their lust for power," "destroy our democratic system," "feverishly to overturn" (emotionally charged, negative descriptors).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on popularity or peer pressure.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified cause-effect claims (e.g., fraud alone explains outcomes).  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Details are specific (e.g., dates, procedures), not vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites "Florida Department of State," "federal prosecutors," and officials like Bradley McVay to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Portrays Democrats as universally corrupt: "The Democrats are committing voter fraud... in Arizona, Georgia, California and elsewhere" (ignores nuance or exceptions).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – Focuses on election documents without irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Refers to actual events (altered documents) without misrepresentation.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting opponents.

### Verdict  
**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely propaganda due to:  
- **Emotive language and fear-mongering**: Loaded terms like "insane," "lust for power," and "destroy our democratic system" demonize Democrats without evidence.  
- **Exaggeration and name-calling**: Claims of "massive scale" fraud and the label "pro-jihad Marxist Democrat" are inflammatory and unsupported by the article’s details.  
- **Selective framing**: While citing official investigations (appeal to authority), it omits counterpoints (e.g., DOS monitors seeing "no election fraud" in Broward).  
- **Black-and-white portrayal**: Reduces a complex recount process to a narrative of unilateral Democratic corruption.  
However, it is not 100% propaganda because it:  
- Includes factual reporting (e.g., dates, procedures, sources like Politico) and quotes officials.  
- Avoids some techniques (e.g., obfuscation, straw men).  
The overtly partisan language, emotional manipulation, and unverified generalizations dominate, aligning with propaganda aims to delegitimize opponents.
