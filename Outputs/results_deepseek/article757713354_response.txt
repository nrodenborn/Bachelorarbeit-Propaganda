### Verdict – **90%** –  
**Explanation**: The text exhibits pervasive use of propaganda techniques, including **loaded language** (e.g., "neocon minions," "murdered"), **name-calling** (e.g., "Big Brother USA"), **appeal to fear** (Libya analogy), and **whataboutism** (deflecting to U.S. weapons). It frames the U.S. as a malicious actor ("wicked plan," "sabotage") while downplaying North Korea’s actions ("prickly... as always"). The author’s bias is evident through selective facts (e.g., omitting North Korean aggression) and **causal oversimplification** (pinpointing Bolton as sole saboteur). Though it raises valid criticisms (e.g., hypocrisy in denuclearization demands), the tone is emotionally charged and manipulative, aiming to delegitimize U.S. policy rather than offer balanced analysis. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges minor factual elements (e.g., canceled talks), but the overwhelming use of propagandistic devices confirms its intent to persuade through emotion and distortion.
