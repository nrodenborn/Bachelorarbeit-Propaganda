1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Brian Kemp accusing Stacey Abrams of having a “ridiculous temper tantrum.” The poll about Jim Acosta also includes the option, “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?” is repeated three times in a row. The phrase “gross mismanagement of this election” is also repeated.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text quotes Brian Kemp using the slogan-like phrase, “We can no longer dwell on the divisive politics of the past but must focus on Georgia’s bright and promising future.”

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text quotes Stacey Abrams vowing to “protect future elections from unconstitutional actions,” which instills fear that without her lawsuit, future elections will be unconstitutional and illegitimate.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire purpose of Abrams’s lawsuit is to “place in doubt the results” of the election. Kemp also casts doubt on Abrams’s motives by calling her challenge a “publicity stunt.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Brian Kemp minimizes the allegations by stating, “The election is over and hardworking Georgians are ready to move forward,” dismissing the gravity of the claims against him.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Stacey Abrams’s reference to protecting elections from “unconstitutional actions” and defending “the people’s democratic right to vote” is an appeal to American democratic principles and identity.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, including “gross mismanagement,” “voter suppression,” “ridiculous temper tantrum,” and “act like a child.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other groups widely hated by the audience.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – Brian Kemp’s statement that “hardworking Georgians are ready to move forward” is an appeal to join the supposed majority opinion and move on from the election controversy.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The poll option “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass” reduces the complex issue of press freedom and conduct to a simple case of being punished for acting “like a child.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text reports on the vagueness of the Abrams campaign, noting that her team alleged voters “ran into electoral barriers, although she did not say what barriers they were.”

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article cites news outlets like “The Associated Press (AP)” and “Breitbart” to add credibility to the information being presented.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text quotes Brian Kemp presenting only two options: to “dwell on the divisive politics of the past” or to “focus on Georgia’s bright and promising future,” ignoring the possibility that addressing past issues is necessary for a better future.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text quotes Brian Kemp using the phrase, “The election is over,” which is used to shut down further debate or questioning of the election’s legitimacy.

16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about Jim Acosta is completely irrelevant to the Georgia gubernatorial election and is inserted to distract the reader with a different, emotionally charged topic.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text quotes Brian Kemp reframing Abrams’s legal challenge as a “ridiculous temper tantrum.” This attacks a caricature of her emotional state rather than her actual legal arguments about voter suppression.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not feature any instances where a criticism is deflected by accusing the opponent of a similar or different transgression.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it reports on a real news event, its structure and content are designed to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than to inform them objectively.

The most definitive piece of evidence is the use of a red herring: the poll about CNN's Jim Acosta. This poll is entirely unrelated to the Georgia election and serves to distract the reader, engage them on a separate partisan issue, and capture their email address for a mailing list called "Truth Uncensored." The framing of the poll itself uses name-calling ("act like a child") and causal oversimplification.

Furthermore, the article heavily relies on loaded language, name-calling, and thought-terminating clichés, primarily by selectively quoting the political actors. It presents Kemp’s dismissal of Abrams’s legal challenge as a “temper tantrum” and a simple desire to “move forward,” which serves to minimize her claims. The sheer volume of propaganda techniques employed (16 out of 18) demonstrates that the article's primary purpose is not journalism but persuasion and political mobilization.
