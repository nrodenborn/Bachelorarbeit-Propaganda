Name calling – Yes – The text labels the Iran nuclear deal as "disastrous" and a "mess." It also refers to the Iranian and North Korean governments as a "rogue regime" and a "rogue dictatorship."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly accuses the Obama administration and John Kerry of lying. For example, it states, "This turned out to be a lie," "This was another lie," and "The Obama administration lied about that too."

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting the JCPOA provides Iran "a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state" and repeatedly uses the example of a nuclear-armed North Korea, which is "on the verge of being able to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads," as a potential future if the deal is not fixed.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is designed to cast doubt on the credibility and motivations of John Kerry and the Obama administration. The title, "Kerry On Edge As Legacy Crumbles," suggests Kerry's objections are based on personal legacy rather than facts.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes President Trump's actions by stating, "all that President Trump has done so far is to return the JCPOA to Congress for review," framing a significant policy challenge as a simple procedural step. It also exaggerates the deal's flaws by calling it "disastrous."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the debate around protecting the "American people" and the "U.S. mainland," and by invoking the Constitution: "Had Obama followed the Constitution and submitted the JCPOA to the Senate as a treaty in the first place..."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as "disastrous," "caved to Iranian pressure," "clean up the mess," "has the gall," and "rogue dictatorship."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text explicitly compares the Iran deal to the "infamous Munich Pact signed by British and French Prime-Ministers... with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler," thereby associating diplomacy with Iran with the appeasement of the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is good because it is popular. In fact, it argues against the position of America's European allies who support the deal.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex issue of North Korea's nuclear armament down to a single cause: "former President Bill Clinton decided not to use military force... Instead, Clinton started us down the primrose path of naïve diplomacy." This ignores decades of other contributing factors.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague or intentionally obscure. It makes very direct, though one-sided, accusations and arguments.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the statement of the Russian Ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, as evidence for its claim that the UN resolution was weak. It quotes him saying, "A call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call... but you cannot violate a call."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between two extremes: either President Trump's "clean up the mess" approach or the "disastrous" and "phony" deal that will inevitably lead to a nuclear-armed Iran, ignoring any potential nuances or alternative outcomes.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The statement "Appeasement through phony deals with a rogue dictatorship does not work" is presented as a universally accepted truth to shut down any discussion of the merits of the diplomatic agreement, which it has already labeled as "appeasement."

Red herring – Yes – The text repeatedly brings up the case of North Korea. While presented as an analogy, it serves to distract from the specific terms and context of the Iran deal and shifts the emotional focus to the fear of a different, already-nuclear state.

Straw men – Yes – The text caricatures John Kerry's position on the sunset provisions. It quotes him saying the deal "never sunsets," then portrays his more nuanced defense of the time limits as "parsing words," refuting a simplified version of his argument rather than engaging with its substance.

Whataboutism – Yes – When the text notes that Kerry accused the Trump administration of “lying to the American people,” it immediately deflects the charge by retorting, "It was the Obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts... The Obama administration lied to the American people," charging the opponent with the same offense.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific and extremely negative viewpoint of the Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA) and the individuals who negotiated it. This is achieved through the dense and systematic application of a vast array of propaganda techniques, with 16 out of the 18 listed techniques being actively used.

The article constructs a simple, emotionally-charged narrative: the Obama administration and John Kerry are liars who, through incompetence or malice, created a "disastrous" deal that endangers America, while President Trump is the responsible leader trying to "clean up the mess." This narrative is reinforced by a constant barrage of techniques. Loaded Language ("caved," "shamelessly") and Name Calling ("rogue regime") create a strong negative emotional tone. This is amplified by an Appeal to Fear, which repeatedly invokes the specter of a nuclear-armed Iran and uses the case of North Korea as a Red Herring to heighten anxiety.

The argument dismisses all opposing views through techniques like Whataboutism (deflecting accusations of lying by accusing the other side of lying), Straw Men (oversimplifying Kerry's arguments to easily refute them), and casting Doubt on the motives of anyone who supports the deal. The piece culminates in the use of Reduction ad Hitlerum, the most extreme form of argument by association, by comparing the diplomatic agreement to the appeasement of Hitler at Munich. This is a clear attempt to shut down rational debate by associating the opposition with one of history's greatest evils. The sheer volume and intensity of these techniques, combined with a complete lack of balanced perspective, confirm that the text is a deliberate work of propaganda.
