Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The author labels Christine Ford a “radical political activist who promotes baby murder” and suggests she has “mental issues.”

Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is repeated three times consecutively. The phrase "political hit" is also used multiple times to frame the events.

Slogans – No – While the text has a strong, memorable title, it does not employ brief, catchy phrases meant for mass repetition in the typical sense of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses more on generating anger and doubt towards Christine Ford and Democrats rather than instilling fear in the audience about a specific future outcome or alternative.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is an exercise in casting doubt on Christine Ford’s credibility, questioning her motives (“Ford is not seeking justice”), her story (“without any evidence at all”), and her stability (“Ford obviously has mental issues”).

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by labeling Ford a promoter of “baby murder,” a highly inflammatory and extreme characterization of a likely pro-choice stance. It also minimizes her testimony by stating it was “with absolutely no evidence,” dismissing testimonial evidence entirely.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its arguments. The focus is on partisan politics rather than national pride.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as “political hit,” “ruining his good name,” “radical political activist,” “baby murder,” and “slander a man’s character,” all designed to evoke strong negative emotions.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or the Nazi party.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text states that Kavanaugh had “literally hundreds of people commend his character,” using the large number of supporters to suggest he must be of good character.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The article attributes the entire complex and multifaceted controversy surrounding the Kavanaugh hearings to a single, simple cause: a “political hit” orchestrated by Democrats.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text makes vague, unsubstantiated claims like Ford’s “prior criminal political activism” and refers to a Democrat senator who “has openly professed to sexual assault” without providing names, dates, or specific details, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites Ricki Seidman, a “Democratic operative,” and refers the reader to a “synopsis by Paul Joseph Watson” to lend credibility to the argument that the events were a political attack.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as having only two sides: either Ford was a willing participant in a “political hit” and is lying, or you are not “thinking clearly.” It dismisses any possibility of nuance, such as Ford believing her own account, regardless of its accuracy.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “If you think Mrs. Ford is ignorant of this... then you aren't thinking clearly” is used to dismiss any counter-argument by insulting the intelligence of those who might hold a different view, thereby discouraging critical thought.

Red herring – Yes – The repeated poll question, “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?”, is entirely irrelevant to the topic of the article and serves as a distraction. The mention of Ford’s father working for the CIA is also used to introduce an element of conspiracy without connecting it logically to the main argument.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the idea that Ford is simply a “victim” by painting her as a “radical political activist.” This misrepresents the position of her supporters, which was focused on the credibility of her specific allegations and the need for investigation, not just her status as a victim.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text attempts to discredit the Democratic committee members by noting that “one of which has openly professed to sexual assault,” deflecting from the issue at hand (the accusations against Kavanaugh) by pointing to alleged hypocrisy in the opposition.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is an unambiguous piece of propaganda. Its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint by using a wide array of manipulative techniques. The article systematically employs emotional appeals, logical fallacies, and attacks on character to achieve its aim.

The author uses a barrage of techniques such as **Name Calling** (“radical political activist,” “mental issues”), **Loaded Language** (“baby murder”), and **Exaggeration** to demonize Christine Ford. This is combined with a relentless effort to sow **Doubt** about her motives, her story, and her supporters. The entire complex event is reduced through **Causal Oversimplification** to a “political hit,” a simple narrative that is easy to accept without critical thinking.

Furthermore, the text is rife with logical fallacies designed to mislead the reader. It uses **Whataboutism** to deflect criticism, a **Red Herring** (the U.N. poll) to distract, a **Black & White Fallacy** to eliminate nuance, and a **Straw Man** to misrepresent the opposing argument. The reliance on these fallacies over factual, evidence-based reasoning demonstrates that the author's intent is manipulation, not objective analysis. The combination of these numerous and powerful propaganda techniques confirms that the text is not a piece of journalism or opinion, but a deliberate work of propaganda.
