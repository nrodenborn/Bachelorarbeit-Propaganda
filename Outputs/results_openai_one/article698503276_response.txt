Certainly! Here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

---

1. **Name calling** – Yes – The text refers to the nuclear deal as “disastrous” and calls Kerry’s actions “caving to Iranian pressure,” and accuses the Obama administration of “recklessly abandoning the facts.”
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The accusation that the Obama administration and Kerry “lied” is repeated multiple times throughout the text.
3. **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries.

5. **Doubt** – Yes – The credibility of the Obama administration, Kerry, and the IAEA is questioned repeatedly.
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The text exaggerates the flaws of the JCPOA (“disastrous,” “mess Obama and Kerry left him”) and minimizes the achievements of the deal.
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – The text appeals to American patriotism, e.g., “President Trump is trying to clean up the mess Obama and Kerry left him.”
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like “gall,” “reckless abandonment,” “caved,” “shamelessly denied,” “phony agreements,” “rogue regime,” and “duplicitous regime” are emotionally charged.
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – The text compares the JCPOA to the Munich Pact with Hitler, suggesting appeasement leads to disaster.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no direct appeal to popularity or the idea that “everyone” agrees with the author’s position.

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is polemical but not intentionally vague or confusing; it makes clear accusations.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites statements from the IAEA chief, Russian ambassador, and other officials to support its claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text presents only two options: Trump’s hardline approach or disastrous appeasement.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Phrases like “Kerry has obviously learned nothing from the North Korean fiasco” are used to shut down debate.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The discussion of North Korea and the Munich Pact distracts from the specifics of the Iran deal.

**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict – 95% –**  
The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, loaded language, reduction ad Hitlerum, causal oversimplification, black & white fallacy, and more. The narrative is heavily slanted, using emotionally charged language, historical analogies to Hitler, and repeated accusations of lying and betrayal. The text’s primary purpose is not to inform objectively but to persuade the reader to adopt a particular negative view of the JCPOA, Obama, and Kerry, while lionizing Trump’s approach. The use of multiple propaganda techniques throughout the text leaves little doubt that it is propaganda, with only a small chance that some elements are simply strong opinion or polemic rather than deliberate manipulation.
