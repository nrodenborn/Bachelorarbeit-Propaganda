Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack its subjects, such as calling Hillary Clinton "Crooked" Hillary and referring to Cory Booker and Eric Holder as "criminals".

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the exact same poll question three times in a row: "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?"

Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief and memorable phrase to rally support for a cause. The headline "They All Look The Same" is a quote being criticized, not a slogan being promoted by the author.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests dire consequences for conservatives who might make similar comments, mentioning a "near lynching" and "death threats," which instills fear about the perceived hypocrisy and danger of the political climate.

Doubt – Yes – The text is structured to make the reader question Hillary Clinton's credibility and sincerity. It does this by quoting her statements on politeness and diversity and immediately contrasting them with her joke, implying she cannot be trusted.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the impact of Clinton's comment by stating, "in less than a minute she would insult both Booker and Holder, and every person with dark skin on the planet."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of national grievance by stating, "Disgusting that she continues to move and speak freely in this country with no justice being brought to bear on her for her many crimes, something we were promised from then-candidate Trump." This frames the issue as a failure to uphold justice within "this country."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's opinion, such as "Racist Joke," "mean, nasty and evil," "near lynching," "fawning," and "Disgusting."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not attempt to explain a complex event with a single simple cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague.

Appeal to authority – No – The text does not cite any experts or authorities to support its claims.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll inserted into the article presents only two options for a complex issue: "* Yes, military force should be used. No, keep the military out of it."

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to discourage critical thought.

Red herring – Yes – The article is about a comment made by Hillary Clinton, but it introduces a completely unrelated poll about using military force against a "caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border," distracting the reader from the main topic.

Straw men – No – The text directly attacks Clinton's own words and actions rather than misrepresenting or inventing an argument to refute.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges its opponents with hypocrisy by asking, "Can you imagine if a conservative person uttered those comments? There would be a near lynching of them on the spot and surely for days to come." This deflects from the initial incident to speculate on the hypocritical reaction of opponents.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It is not a neutral news report but a highly biased opinion piece designed to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of Hillary Clinton and, by extension, the Democratic Party. The article employs a wide array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. Its primary structure is built on **Whataboutism** and casting **Doubt** on Clinton's character. It uses inflammatory and emotionally charged techniques like **Name calling** ("Crooked Hillary"), **Loaded Language** ("Disgusting," "criminals"), and **Exaggeration** ("insult... every person with dark skin on the planet"). Furthermore, it introduces a major **Red herring** in the form of a poll about a migrant caravan, which is not only irrelevant to the topic but also uses a **Black & white fallacy** and **Repetition** to agitate the reader on a separate issue. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and political views rather than to inform them objectively.
