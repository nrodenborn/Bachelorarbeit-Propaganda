Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

**Propaganda Technique Analysis:**

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "Leftists" and "Progressives" are used as insulting labels for political opponents.
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated verbatim three times.
3.  **Slogans – No** – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans are present.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Describes Obama's alleged plan to bring "over a million Muslim refugees" and hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, needing Walmart stores and "millions of acres of land" to house them, implying a secret, massive, and threatening influx planned by the government. "This... speaks volumes in the government's plan to be able to handle millions of people."
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "we really have no idea whether the children brought here during the Obama reign were intentionally separated from their parents... or not." and "We have only what little information the government told us then... considering the fact that Obama wanted to keep as much of this situation as secret as possible." Casts doubt on the transparency and truthfulness of the Obama administration.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration: Claims the actual number of illegal immigrants/refugees "always ends up to be more than quadruple their stated number." Minimization: Refers to Obama's policies as "another excuse" and downplays the uniqueness/specifics of Trump's family separation policy by equating it broadly with Obama-era detention of unaccompanied minors.
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – While national issues are discussed, there is no explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "crackdown," "illegals," "reign" (for Obama's presidency), "surge," "excuse," "idol," "planned event," "imported," "Feds downplay," "very good actors," "cruel and insensitive," "carbon copy," "apparent families," "huge influx." These terms carry strong negative connotations and emotional weight.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparison to Hitler or Nazis is made.
10. **Bandwagon – Yes** – Implied through the poll ("Whom do you consider...") and phrases like "No one should be surprised" and "Many remember", suggesting a common understanding or belief the reader should share.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Simplifies the complex issue of immigration policy and detention facilities by attributing it primarily to a secret plan originating from the Jade Helm exercise: "today's policy... seems to be a planned event by the US government going all the way back to the domestic military exercises known as Jade Helm in 2015." and "All of which seems to be a planned event."
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes** – "This, along with the federal government grab of millions of acres of land during the Obama years, speaks volumes in the government's plan..." (What "this" refers to is ambiguous; the "plan" is vague). "All of which seems to be a planned event." (Vague and unsupported conclusion). "we really have no idea whether the children brought here during the Obama reign were intentionally separated... or not." (States uncertainty without evidence).
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – No authority (expert, institution, etc.) is cited to support claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents the solution to illegal immigration as only two options: "detention and separation" vs. "immediate deportation... on the spot." ("If they were [interested in solving it/caring about children], there would be no detention and separation... only an immediate deportation...").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "The bottom line is..." used to shut down critical examination of the complex Jade Helm claim. "All of which seems to be a planned event." acts as a definitive, unsupported conclusion.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – Introduces the Jade Helm military exercise and the acquisition of land as a distraction from the core discussion of current immigration policy and family separations, framing them as evidence of a long-standing secret plan.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Portrays critics ("the Left", "very good actors") as solely accusing Trump of cruelty over family separation while idolizing Obama and ignoring his similar actions, and as not wanting to admit Obama created the plan. This misrepresents the broader criticisms of the *specifics* and *scale* of the Trump-era "zero tolerance" policy and the motives of critics. Also implies critics oppose *any* enforcement ("If they were [interested/caring], there would be no detention...").
18. **Whataboutism – Yes** – Directly charges opponents (Left/Progressives) with hypocrisy regarding family separation: "What they do not want to admit to...", "their idol, Obama did the same thing...", "When in fact, their idol, Obama did the same thing...". The core argument deflects criticism of Trump by pointing to Obama.

**Verdict:**

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a very high concentration of propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on loaded language, whataboutism (deflecting Trump criticism by attacking Obama), creating doubt about past administrations, exaggeration/minimization, causal oversimplification (Jade Helm conspiracy), straw men (misrepresenting critics' arguments and motives), black-and-white fallacies, thought-terminating clichés, and red herrings (Jade Helm). The core argument is less a factual analysis and more an emotionally charged effort to deflect criticism of Trump's immigration policies by accusing Obama and his supporters of hypocrisy and a secret plan, while simultaneously downplaying Trump's specific actions and promoting a conspiratorial view of government actions (Jade Helm, land grabs, secret refugee plans). The repetition of the "most corrupt" poll further emphasizes its persuasive, rather than informative, intent. While it touches on real policies (detention under both administrations, Jade Helm exercise), the presentation, framing, connections drawn, and unsupported claims are overwhelmingly characteristic of propaganda.
