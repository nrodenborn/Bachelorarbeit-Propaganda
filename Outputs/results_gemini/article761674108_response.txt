1. Name calling – Yes – The author refers to Senator Bob Corker as a "summertime soldier," an insulting label suggesting he is a coward who is unwilling to fight when things get difficult.

2. Repetition – Yes – The author repeatedly attacks the "GOP establishment" and its core policies, which he lists multiple times in slightly different ways, such as "open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism, compulsive military intervention" and later "open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism and democracy-crusading."

3. Slogans – Yes – The author uses several brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate his points, such as the title itself, "Sorry, Jeff Flake, It's Trump's Party Now!" and the line, "We imported goods 'Made in China,' while exporting our future."

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The author warns that if the "GOP establishment" were to regain power after Trump, "there will be a truly uncivil war in this country," instilling fear of chaos and conflict as an alternative to "Trumpism."

5. Doubt – Yes – The author consistently questions the credibility and courage of his opponents, stating, "Jeff Flake is no Barry Goldwater" and suggesting Flake and Corker are only retiring because they know they will lose.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the consequences of establishment policies, describing the Middle East as "awash in blood," and minimizes Trump's role in political coarseness by saying "beneath the savagery... lies more than personal insults."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The author appeals to patriotism by framing the establishment's policies as harmful to America, for example, "U.S. elites made China great again," which implies Trump's agenda is the truly pro-American one.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as "savagery," "uncivil war," "beatified by the Beltway elites," and "monsters to destroy," which are used to evoke strong emotional responses rather than rational thought.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The author attacks the "GOP establishment" but does not suggest their ideas are popular with groups like Nazis or other figures/groups universally hated by the target audience.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The author argues that Trump's ideas are now the dominant force, stating, "Trump is president because he read the party and the country right," and quotes the New York Times to show that Trump's "brand... is taking root within his adopted party."

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author attributes complex phenomena to single, simple causes. For example, he states that a "quarter century of Bushite free trade produced... a loss of 55,000 plants and 6 million manufacturing jobs," ignoring other factors like automation and global economic changes.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's arguments, while biased, are direct and clear. He is not intentionally vague; his targets and his own positions are stated explicitly.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites authorities to support his points, quoting "that most American of writers, Thomas Wolfe," and using a New York Times article as evidence of Trump's triumph.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The author presents the political situation as a simple, two-sided conflict: the failed "GOP establishment" versus the triumphant "Trumpism." He states, "After the Trumpian revolt, there is no going back," presenting only two paths with no room for nuance or a third option.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author uses the phrase, "You can't go home again," a cliché used to shut down the idea that the old establishment could ever return to power, presenting it as an immutable fact.

16. Red herring – No – The author does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract from the main argument. All his points, however biased, are directed at his central theme of discrediting the GOP establishment and validating Trumpism.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes a caricature of his opponents' arguments. He characterizes the establishment's position as supporting "open borders," a term few if any mainstream politicians would use, making their actual, more nuanced positions on immigration easier to attack.

18. Whataboutism – No – The author is on the offensive, directly attacking his opponents' character and policies. He is not deflecting criticism of Trump by accusing his critics of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 100% – This text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or present a balanced analysis, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific political viewpoint by delegitimizing the opposition. The article employs an overwhelming number of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal.

It systematically uses name-calling ("summertime soldier"), loaded language ("savagery"), and appeals to emotion (fear of an "uncivil war") to create a strong negative impression of the "GOP establishment." It constructs a simple, black-and-white narrative of a heroic "Trumpian revolt" against a corrupt and failed elite, using causal oversimplification to blame this elite for complex national problems like job losses and foreign wars.

The author builds an in-group identity through flag-waving ("made China great again") and presents the opposing view as a straw man ("open borders") to make it easier to demolish. The use of bandwagon appeals ("Trump... read the party and the country right") and thought-terminating clichés ("You can't go home again") works to create a sense of inevitability around his preferred outcome. Nearly every sentence is crafted not for objective truth, but for maximum persuasive impact on a target audience, making it a quintessential piece of political propaganda.
