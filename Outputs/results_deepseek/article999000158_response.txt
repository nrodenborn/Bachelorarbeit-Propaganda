Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1. **Name calling – Yes** – "pathological liar," "accused woman abuser," "flea-infested political con man" (all directed at Ellison).  
2. **Repetition – Yes** – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan..." is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans – Yes** – "If you lie down with dogs, you're going to get fleas" (used to taint Ellison by association).  
4. **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "a man who has called on 10,000 blacks to stalk and murder white people" (invokes fear of violence and racial conflict).  
5. **Doubt – Yes** – "Yeah, right, Hakim!" and "Keith, you're lying" (explicitly questions Ellison’s credibility).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Minimizes Ellison’s denouncement of Farrakhan as insincere ("claims that he has distanced himself... Yeah, right") while exaggerating Farrakhan’s influence ("totalitarian-minded," "devil").  
7. **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Implied appeal to American identity by contrasting Farrakhan’s anti-white statements and Ellison’s alleged anti-American associations (e.g., linking to "God damn, America!" and Iranian leaders).  
8. **Loaded Language – Yes** – "pathological liar," "devil," "totalitarian-minded," "Communists," "Islamists," "flea-infested" (emotionally charged, stereotype-driven language).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparison to Hitler or Nazi ideology.  
10. **Bandwagon – No** – No emphasis on popularity or social proof.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Reduces Ellison’s character to guilt-by-association: e.g., associating with Farrakhan/Rouhani automatically makes him a "liar" or "con man."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – Arguments are direct and inflammatory, not vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Uses Michael Ahrens’ tweets as authoritative evidence to debunk Ellison.  
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents Ellison as either fully rejecting Farrakhan (good) or being a hypocritical liar (bad), ignoring nuance in their relationship.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "pathological liar," "flea-infested political con man" (shuts down critical analysis of Ellison’s actual statements).  
16. **Red herring – Yes** – Introduces Obama’s unrelated controversy with Jeremiah Wright to distract from Ellison’s case.  
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Portrays Ellison as claiming ignorance of Farrakhan’s views ("Ellison is attempting to pull an Obama"), though Ellison only stated their views were "incompatible."  
18. **Whataboutism – No** – No accusation of hypocrisy unrelated to the core issue (all criticisms focus on Ellison’s ties to Farrakhan).

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 12 distinct propaganda techniques, with heavy reliance on *name-calling*, *loaded language*, and *doubt* to vilify Keith Ellison. The core argument—that Ellison is deceitful and dangerous due to his association with Farrakhan—is advanced through emotional manipulation (e.g., fear appeals, dehumanizing language like "devil"), distortion of facts (e.g., *straw man*, *causal oversimplification*), and irrelevant distractions (e.g., *red herring* about Obama). The repetitive, poll-driven framing and inflammatory tone ("Yeah, right, Hakim!") further signal an intent to provoke outrage rather than inform. While it cites some factual events (e.g., the 2013 dinner), these are weaponized via selective emphasis and hyperbole to suppress balanced scrutiny (*thought-terminating clichés*). The near-systematic use of these techniques, combined with the overtly partisan source (Freedom Outpost), leaves minimal room for neutral discourse.
