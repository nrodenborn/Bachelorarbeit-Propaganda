### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to the subject (e.g., Smith is referred to neutrally as "suspect" or "perp," which are standard legal terms).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No key message is repeated throughout; the text reports facts sequentially.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to promote an idea (e.g., "#WestervilleStrong" is a community hashtag, not a propagandistic slogan).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text describes a tragic event but does not use fear to advocate for a specific policy or alternative.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the Associated Press’s race-reporting policy: "I can't think of anything less irrelevant than a black gunman shooting two white cops."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates the relevance of the BLM movement to this incident: "after five years of the 'Black Lives Matter' movement" implies a connection without evidence.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or group identity beyond standard expressions of community grief (e.g., "#WestervilleStrong").  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Uses emotionally charged terms like "murdered" (instead of "killed") and "black gunman" (emphasizing race) to evoke bias.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt to link the subject to a universally hated group.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to the popularity of an idea or movement.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Simplifies the shooting as racially motivated by framing it as "a black gunman shooting two white cops" after BLM, ignoring complex factors like domestic violence history.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is direct; details (e.g., suspect’s name, charges) are clearly stated.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authority figures are cited to validate the narrative beyond factual police reports.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Presents no false dichotomy (e.g., no "us vs. them" framing beyond the crime itself).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases that shut down critical thought (e.g., factual reporting dominates).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introduces the BLM movement and media policy as distractions from the core event: "after five years of the 'Black Lives Matter' movement" and criticism of AP’s race-reporting policy.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of an opposing argument.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy against critics.  

### Verdict – 40% – Explanation  
The text begins as straightforward news reporting (e.g., police statements, suspect details) but transitions into commentary using propaganda techniques like **loaded language**, **doubt**, **causal oversimplification**, and **red herring** to frame the incident through a racial/political lens. Specifically, it injects the BLM movement and critiques media policies to imply racial motivation, despite no evidence in the sourced reports. However, ~60% of the text (e.g., AP excerpts, factual timelines) remains neutral. This selective emphasis on race and institutional bias pushes a narrative aligning with anti-BLM or pro-law enforcement agendas, reducing its objectivity. The propaganda likelihood is moderate (40%) due to this imbalance: factual foundations are overshadowed by manipulative framing in key sections.
