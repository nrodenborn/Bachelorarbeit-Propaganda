1. Name calling – Yes – The text reports that Trump refers to the migrant caravan as an “assault” and an “onslaught,” which are insulting labels that frame the group as an aggressive, hostile force.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats Trump's core threat multiple times: "he’ll mobilize the U.S. military to close the border," "I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!," and mentions he "has called for cutting off foreign aid" and later "threatened to withhold American aid."
3. Slogans – No – While the text includes a capitalized phrase "CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!", it is part of a longer sentence in a tweet and not presented as a standalone, memorable slogan for a broader campaign.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses language that instills fear by describing the caravan as an "assault" and an "onslaught" that requires mobilizing the "U.S. military" to stop, suggesting a dangerous invasion.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text reports that Trump, "without providing evidence," claimed Democrats are backing the caravan. This is a direct attempt to question the credibility and motives of his political opponents.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Calling a caravan of 4,000 people, which includes women and children, an "assault" and an "onslaught" that necessitates military action is an exaggeration of the threat they pose.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity. While it discusses national borders and the military, it does so in the context of a threat, not as a call to patriotic duty.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like “assault,” “onslaught,” and “stanch the inflow” to create a negative emotional response towards the migrants.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea should be supported because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents Trump's claim that Democrats are backing the caravan to support "open borders" as the reason for the movement, which is a simple cause for the complex socio-economic issues driving migration.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text includes the claim from Congressman Matt Gaetz that "video footage shows Honduran women and children were being given cash to join the caravan." This statement is vague, lacking specifics about the source of the footage or the identity of those providing the cash, which confuses the issue.
13. Appeal to authority – No – While the text quotes authorities like President Trump and the Honduran President, it is reporting their statements rather than using their authority as proof that a claim is true. In fact, it undermines one authority by stating a claim was made "without providing evidence."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents Trump's framing of the situation as a choice between two extremes: closing the border with military force or allowing an "assault on the nation," ignoring other potential policy options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not contain any phrases or clichés intended to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – Trump's claim that "Democrats are backing the human movement" is an attempt to distract from the humanitarian aspects of the caravan and shift the focus to a domestic political fight.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text reports Trump's claim that Democrats are trying to "bolster their case for ‘open borders’." This misrepresents the typical Democratic stance on immigration, creating a distorted and easily attackable position (a straw man).
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain any instances of deflecting criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it is structured as a news report citing various sources, its primary function is to amplify a propagandistic message. The article heavily relies on reporting statements from President Trump that are filled with propaganda techniques, including name-calling ("assault," "onslaught"), appeal to fear (framing migrants as an invading force), loaded language, exaggeration, and causal oversimplification. It also introduces red herrings and straw man arguments by focusing on the unsubstantiated claim about Democrats' involvement. The selection and framing of these quotes, combined with the sensational headline and the inclusion of a political poll, steer the reader toward a specific, fear-based conclusion rather than providing a neutral, comprehensive overview of the situation. The piece serves to promote a political agenda by demonizing a group of people and a political party.
