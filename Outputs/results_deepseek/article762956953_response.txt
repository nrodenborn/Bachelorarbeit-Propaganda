Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "President Obama, the worst president in American history" is an insulting label attacking the subject.
2.  **Repetition – No** – The core message (Iran aided 9/11, Obama bad for the deal) is stated but not excessively repeated throughout the text in a redundant manner.
3.  **Slogans – No** – The text does not employ a brief, memorable phrase designed for easy recall (e.g., "Make America Great Again"). "Worst president in American history" is more of an insult than a slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – The text instills fear against Iran ("facilitating 9/11 Jihad Terror Attacks") and against the Iran nuclear deal ("should never have proceeded", implying danger from Iran having a deal/nukes).
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – The text explicitly questions Obama's credibility: "even though... Barack Obama had access to information... and certainly knew of Iran’s involvement... Obama still pursued the Iran nuclear deal". This casts doubt on his judgment and motives.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration: The headline "Iran Admits To Aiding Al-Qaeda and Facilitating 9/11 Jihad Terror Attacks" and the overall framing vastly overstate the level of "aid" and "facilitation" described in the sourced report (passport non-stamping for transit passengers under intelligence supervision). Minimization: The text minimizes or ignores any potential rationale Obama might have had for pursuing the nuclear deal (e.g., preventing nuclear proliferation) by solely focusing on the alleged 9/11 connection as a reason it "should never have proceeded".
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – While discussing national security (9/11), the text does not make a direct, emotional appeal to patriotism or national identity as a primary argument technique.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – The text uses highly charged, emotional language designed to evoke strong negative reactions: "Jihad Terror Attacks", "worst president in American history", "gave billions to the Islamic Republic" (implying appeasement), "secretly aided", "refuge".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – The text does not attempt to disapprove of an idea by linking it to a group hated by the audience (e.g., Nazis, ISIS).
10. **Bandwagon – Yes** – The opening lines appeal to popularity: "This has long been known, although the mainstream media dismissed it as a conspiracy theory. But now we have definitive confirmation." This frames the idea as previously suppressed truth now validated, encouraging readers to join the "knowing" group.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – The statement "It was Iran Bush should have invaded after 9/11 , not Iraq" presents invading Iran as a simple solution to the complex event of 9/11, ignoring the myriad other factors and consequences.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text presents its claims (especially about Iran's actions and Obama's knowledge) as clear and direct. It quotes a source to support its points, not obscuring them.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – The text cites "the U.S. 9/11 Commission" as evidence supporting its claim about Iran's role: "The U.S. 9/11 Commission... concluded that Iran played a role..." It also heavily relies on the quoted statements from Mohammad-Javad Larijani and the article by Adam Kredo/Washington Free Beacon as authoritative sources confirming its central claim.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – The text presents a stark, oversimplified choice regarding post-9/11 action: "It was Iran Bush should have invaded after 9/11 , not Iraq." It frames the Iran nuclear deal solely through the lens of the alleged 9/11 involvement, implying it was inherently bad ("should never have proceeded") because of this, ignoring any other potential benefits or complexities.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – The text doesn't employ phrases designed to shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is", "America: love it or leave it"). Its arguments, while biased, are presented as requiring consideration of the cited evidence.
16. **Red herring – No** – The text stays focused on its central claims about Iran's involvement in 9/11 and Obama's handling of it. It doesn't introduce a significantly irrelevant topic to distract.
17. **Straw men – No** – The text argues against Obama's actual decision (pursuing the nuclear deal despite allegedly knowing about Iran's 9/11 role). It doesn't misrepresent or refute an argument he didn't make.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The text does not charge its opponent (Obama) with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated wrongs committed by the US or others.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on **Loaded Language** ("Jihad Terror Attacks", "worst president") and **Name Calling** ("worst president") to evoke strong emotion. It uses **Appeal to Fear** (Iran's danger), **Doubt** (Obama's motives/knowledge), **Bandwagon** ("long known", "definitive confirmation"), and **Appeal to Authority** (9/11 Commission, Larijani quotes) to bolster its central claim about Iran's involvement. It engages in **Exaggeration/Minimization**, vastly inflating the significance of the reported passport non-stamping into "aiding" and "facilitating" the attacks while minimizing context or counter-arguments. It employs **Causal Oversimplification** (invade Iran to solve 9/11) and the **Black & White Fallacy** (invade Iran, not Iraq; deal was inherently bad because of 9/11 link). The headline and framing are highly sensationalist. While it reports on an actual statement by an Iranian official (Larijani) and references the 9/11 Commission findings, the selective emphasis, extreme language, omission of countervailing context, and use of multiple manipulative techniques strongly indicate the primary purpose is not balanced reporting, but rather to promote a specific, highly critical narrative about Iran and the Obama administration, making it highly likely to be propaganda.
