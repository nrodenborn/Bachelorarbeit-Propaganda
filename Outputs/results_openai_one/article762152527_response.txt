**Verdict – 50% – The text contains elements of propaganda, such as appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, and loaded language, which suggest a potential bias or attempt to influence the audience's perception of the Spygate investigation. However, it lacks other common propaganda techniques, such as name-calling, slogans, or bandwagon appeals, which reduces the overall likelihood of it being purely propagandistic. Therefore, while there are signs of propaganda, it is not overwhelmingly so.**
