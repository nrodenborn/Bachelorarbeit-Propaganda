**Verdict – 0%**  
*Explanation: The text is a straightforward news report documenting an incident where a professor incorrectly denied Australia’s status as a country, resulting in a student’s failed assignment. It presents verified facts (e.g., Australia’s dual status as country/continent), includes direct email evidence, and neutrally reports outcomes (grade change, instructor replacement). There is no persuasive agenda, emotional manipulation, distortion of information, or application of propagandistic techniques. The repetition of "Australia is a country" serves clarificatory—not manipulative—purposes. The purpose is informational, not ideological.*
