Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text labels political figures like "Hillary Clinton, Obama, Bush, etc" as "global elite puppets," which is an insulting label used to attack their character and motives.

Repetition – Yes – The idea that a powerful, shadowy elite ("the Deep State," "global elite") is censoring information and independent media is repeated throughout the text in various forms to reinforce the central message.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses short, memorable phrases to make a point, such as "Monkey see, monkey do" to describe the public's reaction to mainstream media campaigns.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns of a "very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon" and quotes a senator warning of a "path to total dictatorship in the U.S." to instill fear in the reader about the future.

Doubt – Yes – The text actively encourages doubt in established institutions, stating that information "coming from the mainstream is usually highly suspect and questionable."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text makes sweeping, exaggerated claims such as, "it all seems to be controlled by one massive conglomerate at the top," which simplifies complex global power dynamics into a single controlling entity.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text opens with a quote from JFK appealing to American values: "The very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies..." It also references the need to preserve the "survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "cyber false flagging at its finest," "ruthless power-seeking elite," and "selfish purposes" to evoke strong negative emotions in the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis to discredit an idea or group.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests a growing movement of awareness, stating that "More and more people see it this way" and that "a global mass is growing closer to a critical mass," encouraging the reader to join the trend.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue by stating, "Donald Trump is extremely vilified not because he allegedly is/was racist/sexist, but because he threatens neoliberalism and neoconservatism..."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text frequently uses vague terms like "the Deep State," "the global elite," and "one massive conglomerate at the top" without ever defining specifically who these groups are, creating a shadowy, ill-defined enemy.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from respected or authoritative figures like JFK, Edward Snowden, and Einstein ("Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.") to lend credibility to its arguments.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the entire conflict as a simple binary: the truthful "Independent media" versus the corrupt "mainstream media" controlled by "the elite." It dismisses nuanced political debate with statements like, "this isn’t about democrats vs republicans, it’s about the elite preserving their control."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like "Monkey see, monkey do" to dismiss the behavior of the masses without critical analysis, thereby discouraging deeper discussion.

Red herring – Yes – While discussing media censorship, the text introduces the topic of "elite pedophilia and ritual abuse." This is an irrelevant and highly inflammatory topic meant to distract the reader and increase outrage against the "elite."

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the argument for content moderation by stating that many now "take on the opinion that people cannot just say what they want on the internet." This oversimplifies the nuanced debate about disinformation into an easily refutable, absolutist position.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text accuses opponents of hypocrisy by stating, "the Clinton’s and John Podesta have even referenced Wikileaks before that became ‘fake,’" implying they are hypocritical for now discrediting a source they previously found useful.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. It employs a vast majority (17 out of 18) of the listed techniques to promote a specific, conspiratorial worldview. Its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade and indoctrinate the reader into believing in a hidden war between a virtuous "us" (the awakened public and independent media) and a malevolent, all-powerful "them" (the "Deep State" or "global elite").

The entire article is built on a foundation of a **Black & White Fallacy**, creating a simple good-versus-evil narrative. This narrative is then fueled by **Appeal to Fear** (warning of a "total dictatorship"), **Loaded Language** ("cyber false flagging"), and **Name Calling** ("global elite puppets") to generate an emotional response of outrage and anxiety. The enemy is kept deliberately unclear through **Obfuscation** (using terms like "The Deep State" without definition), making them seem more sinister and pervasive.

To give its claims a veneer of credibility, the text heavily relies on **Appeal to Authority**, quoting figures like JFK, Snowden, and Einstein. It simultaneously uses **Doubt** to discredit all opposing sources ("mainstream is usually highly suspect"). The argument is further bolstered by logical fallacies like **Causal Oversimplification** (blaming Trump's vilification on a single cause) and **Straw Men** (misrepresenting the argument for content moderation).

Finally, it encourages the reader to join its side through the **Bandwagon** technique, suggesting that a "massive transformation of consciousness" is already underway. The sheer density and combination of these techniques demonstrate a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions rather than engage in a reasoned, factual discussion.
