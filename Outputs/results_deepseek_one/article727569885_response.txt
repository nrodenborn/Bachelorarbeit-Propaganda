### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "pusillanimous foreign policies" (describing Obama), "fascist theocracy" (Iran), "obsequious acolytes" (Obama's team), "despotic mullahs" (Iranian leaders).  
2. **Repetition** – **No** – No significant repetition of phrases or ideas beyond standard rhetorical emphasis.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "peace through strength" (contrasted with "fecklessness through appeasement").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings that Obama’s policies "severely compromised America’s national security," emboldened Iran, and led to naval provocations.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions Obama’s judgment: "perpetual state of confusion about who his friends and enemies were," and "predictably, he didn’t think that the seizure of Americans was important enough to note."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates Obama’s actions: "sold everything including the kitchen sink," "near messianic zealotry." Minimizes Trump’s risks: "restoring clarity," "robust foreign policy."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to patriotism: "America stands with the people of Iran," "compromised America’s national security," "weakened its image."  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotional/derogatory terms: "ruthlessness," "corrupt dictatorship," "groveling," "impotence," "fecklessness," "mischief-making."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis or Hitler.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No emphasis on popularity or trends.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes reduced Iranian belligerence solely to Trump’s policies, ignoring other potential factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are presented directly, without deliberate confusion.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Uses Trump’s statements as evidence: "Trump noted that ‘Iran [was] playing with fire’," "Trump stated."  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents Trump (strong, effective) vs. Obama (weak, appeasing) as the only options, ignoring nuance.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "peace through strength" and "fecklessness through appeasement" shut down critical analysis of diplomatic approaches.  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Focus remains on comparing administrations; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Misrepresents Obama’s stance: claims he believed in "moderate elements" in Iran despite acknowledging all power rests with Khamenei.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting opponents.

### Verdict – 90% –  
**Explanation:** The text exhibits extensive use of propaganda techniques, including **name-calling** (e.g., "pusillanimous," "fascist theocracy"), **loaded language** (e.g., "groveling," "fecklessness"), **black-and-white fallacy** (Trump vs. Obama dichotomy), and **exaggeration** (e.g., Obama "sold everything including the kitchen sink"). It consistently vilifies Obama/Iran while glorifying Trump’s actions, using emotionally charged rhetoric to persuade rather than objectively inform. The reliance on **causal oversimplification** (attributing Iranian restraint solely to Trump) and **appeal to fear** (framing Obama’s policies as catastrophic) further underscores its propagandistic intent. Though structured as analysis, its one-sided framing, omission of counter-evidence, and demonization of opponents align with political propaganda aimed at legitimizing Trump’s policies and discrediting predecessors.
