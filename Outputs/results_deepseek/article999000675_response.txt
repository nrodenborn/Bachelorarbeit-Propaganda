### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Technique Use**: 17/18 techniques are deployed, dominated by *name-calling*, *fear appeals*, and *loaded language* to vilify Farrakhan and Democrats.  
2. **Dehumanization & Polarization**: Labels like "Great Satan," "domestic terrorist," and "traitor" strip nuance, framing complex geopolitics as a moral battle.  
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Relies on fear ("treason," arrest demands) and nationalism ("avowed enemies") to override rational analysis.  
4. **Distortion of Facts**:  
   - Presents Farrakhan’s speech (protected free speech) as "treason" without legal basis.  
   - Implies Democratic "support" for Farrakhan via guilt-by-association (Ellison), ignoring lack of evidence.  
5. **Sourcing Bias**: Cites Iranian state media and partisan outlets (Gateway Pundit, MEMRI) without critical context.  
6. **Intent to Inflame**: Rhetorical questions ("Why allowed back?") and calls for arrests aim to provoke outrage against political opponents (Democrats).  
7. **Omission of Context**: Ignores Farrakhan’s history of controversial statements or U.S.-Iran tensions, reducing discourse to "patriots vs. traitors."  

**Why not 100%?**  
- The quotes from Farrakhan (e.g., "Death to America") are verified, providing a factual anchor. However, their framing exploits emotion over objectivity, cementing the propagandistic purpose.
