### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs **10 distinct propaganda techniques**, including inflammatory labels ("radical leftist," "MS-13 collaborators"), fearmongering ("public safety threats remain at large"), and emotional manipulation (loaded language). The core argument relies on oversimplified causality (blaming the mayor for all escaped immigrants) and red herrings (MS-13 references). Quotes from authorities (ICE, DOJ) lend false legitimacy, while phrases like "That's exactly it" discourage critical analysis. The tone is relentlessly adversarial, framing immigration enforcement as a binary moral issue and dissent as treasonous. These elements align with propaganda’s core function: to provoke visceral reactions and suppress rational debate.**
