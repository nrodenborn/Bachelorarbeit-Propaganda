### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "appeasement-minded government" (used to insult the UK government's policies).

3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., hashtags or rallying cries) are used.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Descriptions of jihad preachers advocating violence (e.g., "chop their head off") instill fear about UK immigration policies.  
5. **Doubt** – No – The text asserts claims as facts without questioning credibility (e.g., "we have never advocated violence" is stated definitively).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "steadily lengthening record" exaggerates the scale of admitting extremists; minimizes activist bans as unjust.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.

13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites Breitbart and specific preachers’ quotes to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents UK as only banning "foes of jihad terror" or admitting "proponents," ignoring nuance.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Extensive Use of Propaganda Techniques**: It employs 9/18 techniques (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, fear appeals) to manipulate emotion and oversimplify complex issues.  
2. **One-Sided Narrative**: Selectively presents facts (e.g., highlighting banned activists while omitting context for extremist admissions) to paint the UK government as intentionally enabling jihadists and suppressing critics.  
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded terms like "jihadist intimidation" and graphic quotes from preachers evoke outrage, discouraging critical analysis.  
4. **Lack of Neutrality**: The author positions himself as a victim ("banned for telling the truth") and frames opponents as universally malicious, ignoring counter-evidence or policy nuances.  
5. **Source Bias**: The article is sourced from Robert Spencer, a known anti-Islam activist, and uses Breitbart (a partisan outlet) without balancing perspectives.  
6. **Oversimplification**: Reduces immigration policy to a binary "free speech vs. jihad" conflict, ignoring legal, diplomatic, or security complexities.  

While not 100% (it cites specific examples like Qadri’s quotes), the overwhelming use of emotive persuasion, cherry-picked data, and absence of objective context confirm a propagandistic intent to vilify the UK government and amplify a specific ideological agenda.
