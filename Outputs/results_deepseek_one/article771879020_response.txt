**Verdict – 95%**  
*Explanation:* The text exhibits 14/18 propaganda techniques, indicating a high likelihood of propaganda. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional manipulation** through loaded language ("federal beast," "Communists") and fear appeals.  
- **Fallacious reasoning** via black/white framing (freedom vs. tyranny), straw men (misrepresenting gun control advocates), and causal oversimplification.  
- **Distraction tactics** like the Kavanaugh poll (red herring) and NRA comparison (whataboutism).  
- **Authority appeals** to Wilson/Gottlieb without addressing counterarguments.  
- **Systematic bias** through minimization of regulatory concerns and exaggeration of impacts ("killed gun control").  
The text's one-sided celebration of a legal settlement while demonizing opponents and ignoring potential societal risks aligns with propagandistic objectives to influence opinion rather than inform neutrally. The 5% uncertainty reflects factual elements about the settlement itself.
