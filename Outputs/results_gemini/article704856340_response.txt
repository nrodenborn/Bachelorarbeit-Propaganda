1. Name calling – Yes – The text attacks a perceived entity with the label “deep state,” describing the event as a “classic deep state false flag operation.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the core message that there were multiple shooters and that the official story is false, using phrases like “even more proof that there were multiple shooters,” “further debunking the official narrative,” “another active shooter up there,” and “yet another instance of a possible second shooter.”

3. Slogans – No – The text uses loaded phrases and clichés, but it does not employ brief, memorable slogans in the traditional sense.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting a powerful, hidden entity (the “deep state”) is orchestrating mass shootings and that the authorities are covering it up, creating anxiety about the government and public safety.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire purpose of the text is to cast doubt on the official account, explicitly stating it is “calling into question almost every aspect of what actually happened” and “debunking the official narrative.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the conclusiveness of its evidence, presenting chaotic radio transmissions as “even more proof” and claiming there is a “shocking amount of evidence” for its conclusion, which is an overstatement of the presented material.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of national identity by framing the issue as something authorities are trying to prevent from reaching the “American people,” implying that uncovering this "truth" is a patriotic act against a corrupt system.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the reader, such as “Vegas cover-up,” “frantically notes,” “shocking amount of evidence,” and “classic deep state false flag operation.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text creates the impression that belief in a conspiracy is growing and becoming more widespread by stating the new information “comes on the heels of dozens of similar reports,” encouraging the reader to join this growing group.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – After arguing against the official simple cause (a lone gunman), the text offers its own simple cause for the complex event: a “classic deep state false flag operation,” which is a simplistic explanation for all the presented anomalies.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses the term “deep state” without ever defining who or what it is. This vague term allows the reader to project their own fears and suspicions onto it, and it obscures the lack of specific evidence for who was responsible.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites alternative or counter-culture authorities to support its claims, such as “Intellihub’s Shepard Ambellas,” entrepreneur “Grant Cardone,” and political strategist “Mike Tokes.”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: the official “lone gunman” narrative (which it portrays as a deliberate lie) and the multi-shooter conspiracy “truth.” It ignores other possibilities, such as simple errors and confusion in the chaos of a mass casualty event.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “classic deep state false flag operation” serves as a thought-terminating cliché. It provides a simple, all-encompassing explanation that discourages further critical thought or nuanced analysis of the evidence.

16. Red herring – Yes – The section about Grant Cardone being in the bar *before* the shooting is a red herring. It adds celebrity intrigue but is irrelevant to proving there was a second shooter *during* the attack, distracting from the core claim.

17. Straw men – No – The text attacks the actual official narrative (that there was a lone gunman) rather than misrepresenting it and then attacking the misrepresentation.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text accuses authorities of a cover-up but does not deflect criticism by charging them with hypocrisy on an unrelated matter.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, unsubstantiated conspiracy theory. It achieves this by systematically employing a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques.

The entire article is built on a foundation of **doubt** and **appeal to fear**, designed to erode trust in official sources. It uses **loaded language** ("cover-up," "deep state") and **repetition** to hammer home its central claim. The evidence presented is given undue weight through **exaggeration**, and its credibility is bolstered by an **appeal to alternative authorities**.

Furthermore, the text uses logical fallacies to guide the reader to a predetermined conclusion. It presents a **black & white fallacy** (the official story is a lie, therefore our theory is the truth), and then offers a **causal oversimplification** ("deep state false flag") which also functions as a **thought-terminating cliché**, shutting down further inquiry. The use of a **bandwagon** appeal ("dozens of similar reports") encourages readers to join a supposedly growing consensus. The combination of these techniques creates a persuasive narrative that is emotionally compelling but lacks factual and logical rigor, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
