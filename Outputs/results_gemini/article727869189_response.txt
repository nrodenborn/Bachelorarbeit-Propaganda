Here are the propaganda techniques and whether they are used in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The author labels Faggioli’s arguments with insulting terms like “rhetorical tricks,” “soft-peddled Hegelianism,” and “rank historicism.”
2.  Repetition – No – While the author reiterates their central theme, the text does not repeat the same specific message or phrase over and over.
3.  Slogans – Yes – The author uses Pope Benedict’s phrase “a dictatorship of relativism” as a memorable, impactful phrase to summarize the perceived threat of Faggioli’s position.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The author warns that Faggioli’s views represent a “dangerous historicist impulse” that will lead to a “dictatorship of relativism that does not recognize anything as definitive.”
5.  Doubt – Yes – The author questions Faggioli’s credibility and intellectual honesty by accusing him of using “a combination of rhetorical tricks and soft-peddled Hegelianism” instead of engaging in a straightforward debate.
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the implications of Faggioli’s argument by stating he sought to “completely redefine the role and nature of the Catholic Church” and that the debate is fundamentally “about truth and our ability to judge right from wrong.”
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The author appeals to a specific Catholic identity by framing the debate as a defense of the Church’s traditional truths against “the whims and failures of secular modernity” and quoting a former Pope to reinforce this identity.
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to describe Faggioli’s position, such as “theologically unsettling,” “absurd,” “rank historicism,” and “dangerous.”
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with hated groups like Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The author does not argue that their position is correct because it is popular. In fact, they criticize Faggioli for supposedly arguing that the Church should follow the popular trend of secular society.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author simplifies Faggioli’s argument to a single cause: that the Church should change its rules simply “to keep the pews full,” ignoring potentially more complex theological reasoning.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s own argument is presented clearly and directly, not with deliberate vagueness.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author extensively quotes Pope Benedict XVI to support their argument against Faggioli’s position, using his authority as a former Pope as evidence.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The author presents the situation as a choice between two extremes: either upholding the Church’s timeless truth or succumbing to a “dangerous historicist impulse” and a “dictatorship of relativism.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “It should be clear to anyone, not just practicing Catholics, that this is absurd” is used to shut down critical thought by asserting the conclusion is self-evident and not open to debate.
16. Red herring – Yes – The author introduces the presidency of Donald Trump as an example. While used to make a point about objective judgment, it is an irrelevant and emotionally charged topic designed to distract from the core theological debate and align the reader with the author’s position on a different matter.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author reframes Faggioli’s position as arguing that “the Church ought to bend to the will of secular society” and exist “simply to accommodate the whims and failures of secular modernity.” This is an oversimplified and uncharitable version of Faggioli’s argument that is easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – The author does not attempt to discredit Faggioli by accusing him of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is not a neutral report on a debate but a highly persuasive opinion piece that heavily employs propaganda techniques to advocate for one side. The author’s goal is to discredit Massimo Faggioli’s position and promote the one articulated by Ross Douthat and the author themself.

The text systematically uses a wide array of techniques to achieve this. It attacks Faggioli’s character and intellectual honesty (Name Calling, Doubt), misrepresents his arguments to make them seem weaker (Straw Men, Causal Oversimplification), and uses emotionally charged language to create a negative impression (Loaded Language). It frames the entire debate in extreme, fear-inducing terms (Appeal to Fear, Black & White Fallacy) and shuts down counter-arguments with dismissive phrases (Thought-Terminating Clichés). Furthermore, it bolsters its own position by appealing to a respected figure (Appeal to Authority - Pope Benedict XVI) and a shared sense of identity (Flag-Waving). The introduction of a polarizing political figure (Red Herring) also serves to emotionally sway the reader. The sheer number and consistent application of these techniques indicate that the article's primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint by manipulating their emotions and perceptions, which is the essence of propaganda.
