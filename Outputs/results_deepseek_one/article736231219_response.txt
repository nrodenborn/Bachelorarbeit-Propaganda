### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 95% –** The text employs **15 of 18 propaganda techniques** (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, red herring, whataboutism). It vilifies Farrakhan using inflammatory labels, distracts with Obama references, and accuses media of bias while minimizing Farrakhan’s coverage. The framing ("leftist media," "smear Trump as Hitler") pushes a partisan narrative, and the selective outrage (ignoring Farrakhan’s reach) serves an agenda. Only 3 techniques are absent, confirming overwhelming propagandistic intent.
