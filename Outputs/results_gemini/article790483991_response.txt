Here are the propaganda techniques and whether they are used in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – Explanation: The text refers to opponents as “corrupt men in high places” and accuses the Pope of comparing Viganò to “the great accuser, Satan.”
2.  Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The core accusation that Pope Francis knew about and covered up McCarrick’s abuse is repeated throughout the text, for instance in the introduction (“restates his initial accusations of abuse cover-up against Francis”) and in the testimony itself (“The center of my testimony was that since at least June 23, 2013, the pope knew from me how perverse and evil McCarrick was”).
3.  Slogans – No – Explanation: The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases repeated to serve as a rallying cry or summary of the message.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation: The text warns that Viganò is standing against “the most dangerous pontificate in history, but also the forces of hell itself” and that “The enemy is not only at the gates but has now made their way to the thrones of power.”
5.  Doubt – Yes – Explanation: The text is designed to question the credibility of the Pope and the Vatican, for example by stating, “Neither the pope, nor any of the cardinals in Rome have denied the facts I asserted... ‘Qui tacet consentit’ surely applies here.”
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: The text uses exaggeration to heighten the stakes, describing Viganò’s statement as a “4-page bombshell” and his struggle as a fight against “the most dangerous pontificate in history.”
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation: The text appeals to a specific Catholic identity to rally support, using phrases like “for the good of the Church,” “Holy Mother Church,” and urging the faithful to “fight and win with Mary the battle against the old dragon.”
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as describing Viganò as the “most courageous prelate,” his testimony as “powerful,” and McCarrick as “perverse and evil.”
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation: The text does not disapprove of an idea by suggesting it is popular with hated groups like Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – Explanation: The introduction encourages readers to join a growing movement of support, stating, “we here at The Remnant not only stand with Viganò but we thank God for him every day... We are with you!”
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: The text attributes Cardinal Ouellet’s alleged change in position to a simple cause: “his work as prefect... was being undermined because recommendations for episcopal appointments were being passed directly to Pope Francis by two homosexual ‘friends’ of his dicastery.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanation: The text makes direct and specific accusations rather than using deliberately unclear or obscure expressions.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation: The text relies on the authority of the author (“Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò”) and God (“I declare with a clear conscience before God that my testimony is true”) to validate its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation: The text presents the situation as a simple choice between Viganò, who is an “honest man who has only the good of the Church in his heart,” and his opponents, who are “corrupt men in high places.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – Explanation: The text does not use clichés to discourage critical thought; instead, it seeks to provoke a specific line of critical thought against its target.
16. Red herring – No – Explanation: The text remains focused on its central topic of accusations against the Pope and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract.
17. Straw men – No – Explanation: The text directly addresses the Pope’s stated reaction (or lack thereof) rather than refuting a weaker, unstated argument.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – Explanation: The text charges Pope Francis with hypocrisy, stating his “unwillingness to respond... are hardly consistent with his calls for transparency and bridge building” and that he engaged in slander while often preaching against it.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast majority (13 out of 18) of the listed techniques. The piece is not a neutral presentation of facts but a deliberate and strategic effort to persuade the audience. The introductory section frames Archbishop Viganò as a heroic, solitary figure of truth and his opponents as corrupt, evil, and even demonic. It uses loaded language, appeals to fear, and exaggeration to create a dramatic, emotionally charged narrative. Viganò’s own testimony, while presented as a solemn declaration, uses similar techniques, including casting doubt, appealing to his own authority, charging hypocrisy (whataboutism), and presenting a black-and-white view of the conflict. The primary goal is not to inform objectively but to rally support for one side of a conflict by manipulating the reader's emotions and perceptions.
