1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the MeK group as a "violent Islamist-Marxist cult" and refers to Rudy Giuliani as "bombastic". It also repeatedly uses the term "neocons" as a pejorative label for a political faction.
2. Repetition – Yes – The concept of "blowback" is repeated multiple times to reinforce it as the central theme and inevitable consequence of the policy being discussed. The term "neocons" is also used repeatedly to label the antagonists of the piece.
3. Slogans – No – The text uses strong and memorable phrases, but it does not employ a brief, catchy slogan that is repeated in the manner of a political rally cry.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The article explicitly links the proposed Iran policy to the 9/11 attacks through the concept of "blowback," warning of dire consequences. Example: "We need to worry about blowback from President Trump’s fully-neoconized Middle East policy! That’s the real threat!"
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the understanding and motives of Rudy Giuliani and other neoconservatives. Example: "Unfortunately, it is clear that Giuliani never really understood what I was trying to tell him. Like the rest of the neocons, he either doesn’t get it or doesn’t want to get it."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The title, "Trump’s Plan for Iran: Put Terrorists in Charge?", exaggerates a complex policy proposal into a simplistic and shocking headline to grab attention.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text argues that a specific US policy is harmful to the United States, which is an appeal to national interest, but it does not use patriotic symbols or language to rally support for its own position.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to influence the reader's opinion. Example: "Unleashing terrorists on Iran to overthrow its government is not only illegal and immoral: it’s also incredibly stupid."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups to discredit the opposing viewpoint.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. In fact, it frames its argument as being in opposition to a powerful mainstream group ("neocons").
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simplified cause for the 9/11 attacks to support its argument about "blowback." Example: "They came over here because we had been killing Muslims “over there” for decades."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's argument is direct and clear. It explicitly states who it blames and what it fears will happen.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites the "US intelligence community and particularly by the CIA" as authorities who understand the concept of "blowback." The article is also posted "with permission from Ron Paul," using his name as a political authority to lend credibility.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the choice regarding Iran as one between two extremes, ignoring other possibilities. Example: "Does anyone (except for the neocons) really believe it is better to unleash terrorists on a population than to engage them in trade and travel?"
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text aims to provoke critical thought about a specific policy, rather than shut down discussion with simplistic, generic phrases.
16. Red herring – Yes – The embedded poll is a clear red herring. The article is about US foreign policy toward Iran, but the poll abruptly asks, "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?", which is an unrelated topic meant to distract and redirect the reader's attention and anger.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified version of the opposing argument for the 9/11 attacks. Example: "They didn’t do it because we are so rich and so free, as the neocons would have us believe." This sets up an easily defeated caricature of the opposing viewpoint.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes its opponents but does not deflect criticism by accusing them of hypocrisy with a "what about you?" argument.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to advocate for a specific political viewpoint and discredit another. The article's primary goal is not to inform in a balanced way, but to persuade through emotional manipulation and logical fallacies. It uses loaded language ("violent...cult," "incredibly stupid") and name-calling ("neocons," "bombastic Giuliani") to create a strong negative emotional response toward its targets. It heavily relies on an appeal to fear, explicitly connecting the criticized policy to the trauma of 9/11 via the repeated concept of "blowback." The argument is built on logical fallacies, including a black & white choice between "unleashing terrorists" and peaceful trade, a straw man argument about the motivations for 9/11, and a causal oversimplification of that same event. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant "Red Herring" poll about "corrupt" Democrats further confirms the text's propagandistic nature, as it serves no purpose other than to distract and channel animosity toward a separate political group. While it discusses real-world events and figures, the framing is so heavily biased and reliant on manipulative techniques that it functions as a clear piece of propaganda.
