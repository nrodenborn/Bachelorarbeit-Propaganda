Based on the provided definitions and analysis of the text, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "Diversity dogs" is an insulting label used to attack the current state of academic history.
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There is no brief, memorable phrase designed as a rallying cry.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Implied/Weak – The tone suggests a negative consequence (loss of focus on "what really matters") but doesn't explicitly instill fear against alternatives. (Answer: **No** - Not a clear enough appeal to fear as defined).
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text presents the report's findings as fact; it doesn't directly question the credibility of specific institutions or figures.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Traditional topics like "Liberalism" and "Democracy" are minimized as "mere historiographical curiosities" and described as "Lagging well in the rear".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Diversity dogs," "dutifully," "mere historiographical curiosities," "Lagging well in the rear," "what really matter," and the sarcastic "get with the multiculturalist/Identity Politics program" use emotionally charged or judgmental language.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison is made to Nazis or universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Popularity is not used as a reason to adopt the viewpoint.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Implied/Weak – The data correlation is presented as evidence of a shift in focus, implying identity politics *caused* the decline of traditional topics without proving causation. (Answer: **No** - While suggestive, it doesn't explicitly state a single, simple cause for the complex state of history teaching).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text presents specific data points and conclusions clearly.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The findings and authority of the IPA report and Dr. Bella d’Abrera (PhD, Cambridge) are used as the primary evidence supporting the argument.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text frames the situation as a binary choice: history focusing on "race, gender and ethnicity" (bad) vs. history focusing on "political, intellectual, demographic and material factors" (what "really matters").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – The sarcastic command "get with the multiculturalist/Identity Politics program – enroll in a history course at an Australian university today!" discourages critical examination of the report's interpretation or the value of identity-focused history.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text remains focused on the topic of history course themes.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text doesn't misrepresent a specific opposing argument; it presents its own interpretation of the data.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge opponents with hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 95% – Explanation:**
The text exhibits multiple clear propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating clichés). Its primary purpose is not to neutrally inform but to persuade the audience of a specific, negative viewpoint: that Australian university history teaching has been negatively taken over by "Identity Politics" and "Diversity" at the expense of traditional, "important" topics. This is achieved through:
1.  **Selective Data Presentation:** While presenting numerical data, it frames the results using highly biased language ("dutifully," "mere curiosities," "what really matters") to guide the reader's interpretation.
2.  **Emotional Language & Framing:** Terms like "Diversity dogs," "what really matters," and the minimization of traditional topics are designed to evoke disapproval and agreement with the author's perspective.
3.  **Oversimplification & False Dichotomy:** It reduces the complex state of historical study to a simplistic battle between "good" (traditional factors) and "bad" (identity politics), ignoring potential overlaps or valid reasons for the thematic focus observed.
4.  **Discrediting Alternatives:** The use of sarcasm ("get with the program") and thought-terminating clichés dismisses any potential counter-argument or value in the identity-focused courses.
5.  **Reliance on an Aligned Authority:** The argument rests heavily on the perceived authority of the IPA report, an organization with a known libertarian/conservative viewpoint, presented as objective proof.

While based on a real report, the text's presentation, framing, and language go far beyond neutral reporting and are designed to promote a specific ideological critique. It actively seeks to shape the reader's opinion against the current state of history teaching using classic propagandistic methods. The high percentage reflects the density and clear intent of the techniques employed.
