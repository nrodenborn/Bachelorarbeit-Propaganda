### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against any subject.  
2. **Repetition** – No – The phrase "sonic attacks" is repeated, but this reflects the topic’s terminology, not deliberate messaging reinforcement.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to promote an idea (e.g., no rallying cries).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Emphasizes the "bizarre," "debilitating," and mysterious nature of the attacks, alongside symptoms like "mild brain damage," to instill fear about diplomatic travel. Example: "reconsider travel to Cuba" due to risks.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions the U.S. State Department’s transparency: "The U.S. State Department has remained all but silent on the issue."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Descriptions (e.g., symptoms, events) are reported factually without clear amplification or downplaying.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotional terms like "bizarre," "agonizing," "debilitating," and "invisible wall" evoke alarm. Example: "grinding, blaring cacophony" intensifies dread.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No associations with hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Complexity is acknowledged (e.g., "unknown" causes, multiple countries).  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – The text is clear and descriptive despite the mystery.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites government sources (e.g., State Department, embassy spokesperson) to validate claims. Example: "Jinnie Lee, U.S. Embassy spokesperson... told Gizmodo."  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dilemmas (e.g., no "only two choices" presented).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases that halt critical analysis (e.g., no "this is just common sense").  
16. **Red herring** – No – All details relate directly to the sonic attacks.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy.

### Verdict – 15% –   
The text exhibits minimal propaganda techniques, primarily relying on **loaded language** and **appeal to fear** to sensationalize a mysterious event. However, it cites multiple sources (e.g., State Department, medical evaluations, named publications) and reports verifiable facts (e.g., symptoms, travel advisories). The tone leans toward alarmist journalism rather than deliberate manipulation, as it lacks overt persuasion, ideological framing, or calls to action. The 15% likelihood reflects minor sensationalism but not systematic propaganda.
