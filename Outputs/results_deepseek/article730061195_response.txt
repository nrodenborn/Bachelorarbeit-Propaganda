Here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No – The text uses factual labels like "suspect," "husband," or "Smith" without insulting epithets.  
2. **Repetition** – No – No phrase or idea is repeated excessively; information is presented sequentially.  
3. **Slogans** – No – There are no catchy, rallying phrases (e.g., "Please help" is a plea, not a slogan).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text describes a violent event factually but does not use fear to promote an agenda or policy.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility occurs; sources (e.g., 911 call, police records) are presented as factual.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Details are reported neutrally (e.g., "shot dead" is direct but not sensationalized; prior incidents are stated without downplaying).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism, loyalty, or group identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – No – Language is descriptive but not emotionally manipulative (e.g., "pleads for help" and "crying" reflect the 911 call’s content without added bias).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association of Smith or the event with universally hated groups (e.g., Nazis).  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No suggestion that readers should adopt a view because it is popular.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text cites multiple factors (domestic violence history, illegal gun possession) without oversimplifying causes.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are specific (e.g., timestamps, prior incidents) with no deliberate confusion.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Authorities are cited for facts (e.g., police records), not to endorse an ideological position.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text acknowledges complexity (e.g., history of disturbances, conflicting past reports of "nothing amiss").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases discourage analysis (e.g., "records showed" invites verification).  
16. **Red herring** – No – All details relate directly to the event (e.g., prior domestic calls, gun possession).  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented arguments are refuted; the report focuses on factual events.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy distract from the subject.  

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is a straightforward news report recounting a tragic event using verified sources (911 audio, police records, court documents). It presents facts chronologically without emotional manipulation, loaded language, or overt persuasion. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges potential subtle framing (e.g., highlighting the wife’s distress or Smith’s criminal history), but this aligns with standard journalistic context rather than propaganda. No techniques are deployed to systematically influence opinion beyond factual reporting.
