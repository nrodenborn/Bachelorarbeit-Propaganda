### Verdict – 70% – Detailed Explanation  
**Yes, this text contains propaganda**, though mixed with substantive theological argumentation. Key indicators:  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded terms ("atrocity," "suicidal") and fear appeals (chaos, Reformation parallels) dominate.  
- **Oversimplification**: Complex issues (church modernization, moral theology) reduced to "doctrine vs. destruction" binaries.  
- **Authoritarian framing**: Doctrine is presented as immutable via appeals to authority (Müller, encyclicals) while dissent is delegitimized.  
- **Targeted rhetoric**: Pejorative labeling ("atrocity") of LGBTQ+ blessings frames opponents as violating divine will.  

However, the text **avoids** outright falsehoods or overt conspiracy tropes. It cites specific documents (*Veritatis Splendor*, *Amoris Laetitia*) and legitimate theological debates, giving it a veneer of doctrinal discourse. The 70% likelihood reflects a **partisan advocacy piece** using propaganda techniques to advance a traditionalist agenda within internal church politics, rather than pure disinformation. Contextually, LifeSiteNews’s ideological slant amplifies these techniques.
