1. Name calling – No – The text reports on President Trump using the word “invasion,” but the article itself does not use insulting labels to attack the migrants.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly mentions the installation of razor wire and barricades. It is mentioned in the first, second, fifth, and subsequent paragraphs. The poll about Jim Acosta is also repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text mentions the name of the military operation, “Operation Faithful Patriot,” which is a brief and memorable phrase designed to appeal to patriotism.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text builds a narrative of a significant threat by detailing a massive military response. Phrases like “potential clashes,” “potential safety and security risk,” and “perceived threat,” combined with descriptions of troops, razor wire, drones, and helicopters, are used to instill fear.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text uses the phrase “so-called migrant caravan,” which questions the legitimacy or nature of the group of migrants.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text prominently features President Trump’s description of the caravan as an “impending migrant ‘invasion’,” which is an exaggeration of the situation.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The name of the military mission, “Operation Faithful Patriot,” is a direct appeal to patriotism. One of the embedded tweets also includes an American flag emoji (🇺🇸).
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases, such as quoting the term “invasion” and using the word “thwart” to describe the military’s goal. The poll option, “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass,” is also an example of loaded language.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other groups widely hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular and that the reader should adopt it for that reason.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text focuses on the response to the caravan rather than explaining its cause, so it does not offer a simplified cause for the event.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses the phrase “port hardening infrastructure equipment,” which is a deliberately vague and obscure expression for barriers and fencing.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses statements from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and quotes President Trump to lend credibility to the idea that there is a significant threat requiring a military response.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll about Jim Acosta presents limited, emotionally-charged options (“Yes, he should have gotten it back” vs. “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass”), creating a false dichotomy that ignores nuance.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The poll option “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass” is a simplistic, dismissive phrase that discourages a more critical discussion about the issue of press credentials.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about whether Jim Acosta should have his press pass back is completely irrelevant to the topic of the migrant caravan and border reinforcements. It serves as a distraction from the main subject of the article.
17. Straw men – No – The article does not create and then refute a false argument from an opponent.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an opponent by charging them with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it contains factual elements, such as embedded tweets from journalists on the ground, its primary aim is to construct a specific narrative rather than to report neutrally. The article employs a large number of propaganda techniques to achieve this. The central narrative is built on an **Appeal to Fear**, framing the caravan as a “perceived threat” and an “invasion” that justifies a massive military response. This is reinforced through **Loaded Language** (“thwart,” “invasion”), **Repetition** of the military preparations, and an appeal to **Flag-Waving** (“Operation Faithful Patriot”). Most telling is the inclusion of a **Red Herring**—the poll about Jim Acosta—which has no relevance to the article's topic and serves only to distract and engage the reader on a separate, emotionally charged political issue. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the audience's perception and emotions rather than to simply inform them.
