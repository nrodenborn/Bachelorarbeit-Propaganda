Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as name calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and whataboutism. These techniques suggest a significant likelihood of the text being propaganda, as they are used to shape the audience's perception of the bloggers and justify the decision to ban them from the UK. However, not all techniques are present, and the text does provide some factual information, which slightly reduces the likelihood of it being pure propaganda.
