Verdict – 10% – The text primarily provides factual information about the Ebola outbreak in DR Congo, including statistics and responses from health authorities. While there is a slight appeal to fear by mentioning the dangers of a wider outbreak, the overall tone is informative rather than propagandistic. The mention of authority figures like WHO is factual and relevant to the context, rather than an attempt to manipulate the audience. Therefore, the likelihood of this text being propaganda is low.
