Name calling – Yes – The text labels a Democratic candidate as a “pro-jihad Marxist Democrat,” which is a combination of insulting labels meant to attack the subject.

Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?” is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the style of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text claims that Democrats “will destroy even our democratic system to get it,” which is intended to instill fear in the reader about the consequences of Democrats gaining power.

Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the legitimacy of election results by stating, “Republicans have pointed to embattled Broward Elections chief Brenda Snipes’ record of past election gaffes in arguing that the largely Democratic country is tilted against them — perhaps fraudulently so.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by claiming “The Democrats are committing voter fraud on a massive scale, and not only in Florida, but in Arizona, Georgia, California and elsewhere,” using a specific, localized allegation as a basis for a sweeping, unproven generalization.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and democratic principles by claiming Democrats are working to “overturn the will of the people” and will “destroy even our democratic system.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases such as “pro-jihad Marxist Democrat,” “working feverishly,” and “insane in their lust for power” to evoke strong negative feelings.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its ideas are popular or that the reader should join a majority.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex reasons for recounts and election disputes by attributing them to a single cause: “The Democrats are committing voter fraud on a massive scale.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The claim that fraud is happening in “Florida, but in Arizona, Georgia, California and elsewhere” uses the vague term “elsewhere” to imply the problem is more widespread than specified without providing evidence.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text frames its entire argument around a legitimate news source, citing the headline: “Federal prosecutors reviewing altered election documents tied to Florida Democrats,” by Matt Dixon, Politico, November 14, 2018.” This is done to lend credibility to the author’s own unsubstantiated claims.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll offers a loaded binary choice: “Yes, he should have gotten it back” versus “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass.” This frames the opposition as agreeing with the insult, presenting only two simplistic options and ignoring any nuance.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The opening sentence, “It is high time that this begin,” is a phrase that asserts the conclusion as self-evident and discourages any critical thought or discussion about whether the investigation is warranted.

Red herring – Yes – The poll “Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?” is entirely irrelevant to the topic of the Florida election and serves as a distraction from the main article.

Straw men – No – The text primarily makes direct attacks and assertions rather than misrepresenting and then refuting an opponent’s specific argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text makes direct accusations against its opponents but does not use the technique of deflecting criticism from its own side by pointing out the hypocrisy of an opponent.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its structure is designed to manipulate the reader. It begins with a highly emotional and biased introduction filled with numerous propaganda techniques, including name-calling ("pro-jihad Marxist"), exaggeration ("massive scale"), appeal to fear ("destroy even our democratic system"), and causal oversimplification. This introduction acts as a frame, telling the reader how to interpret the information that follows.

The text then uses an appeal to authority by embedding a legitimate news article from Politico. This is a sophisticated technique that lends a veneer of credibility to the author's extreme introductory claims. The reader is led to believe that the author's biased framing is justified because a real news outlet is reporting on a related issue.

Finally, it employs a red herring by inserting a completely unrelated poll about Jim Acosta, which itself uses a black & white fallacy and repetition. The sheer density and variety of propaganda techniques, combined with the deliberate structure of wrapping biased commentary around a factual report, confirm that the text's primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade and manipulate the audience's opinion.
