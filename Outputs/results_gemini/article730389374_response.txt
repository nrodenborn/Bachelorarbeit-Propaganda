1. Name calling – Yes – The author labels the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD) as a "charter member of the War Party," which is an insulting label meant to discredit the organization.
2. Repetition – No – The text develops a singular argument against intervention but does not repeat the same specific message or phrase over and over.
3. Slogans – Yes – The author uses the short, memorable, and impactful phrase "Our orders have been cut" to sarcastically summarize his view on the influence of an Israeli official's recommendation.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The author instills fear by suggesting deeper involvement in Syria could lead to a scenario where "The U.S. and Turkey... may soon be staring down each other's gun barrels" and a "new and wider war" that would leave America "bleeding, bankrupt, divided and disillusioned."
5. Doubt – Yes – The author questions the credibility of the claim that Iran sent the drone by calling it an "act of monumental stupidity" and listing reasons why Iran would not have done so, thereby casting doubt on the official narrative.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author uses the hyperbolic phrase "Our orders have been cut" to exaggerate the influence of an Israeli intelligence official's statement for rhetorical effect.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The author appeals to patriotism by contrasting the interests of other nations with American interests, asking, "But while Israel's interests are clear, what would be the U.S. vital interest?"
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases such as "War Party," "broken and bleeding country," and "bleeding, bankrupt, divided and disillusioned" to evoke strong negative emotions in the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the technique's definition includes disapproving of an idea by associating it with a group hated by the audience. The author associates the pro-war position with the "Israeli lobby" and the "War Party," groups that his target audience likely views with suspicion or hostility.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular; in fact, it argues against a position being advanced by powerful entities.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The author does not offer a simple cause for a complex event. Instead, the text emphasizes the complexity of the situation in Syria by mentioning multiple actors and conflicting interests.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's writing is direct and clear. He makes his points and asks his questions without using deliberately obscure or confusing language.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author appeals to the authority of "Candidate Donald Trump" and his past promises ("to extricate us from Middle East wars") as evidence to support his own argument against intervention.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The author presents a simplified choice by stating, "But this calls for active diplomacy, not military action," framing the situation as a binary choice between two options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text is designed to provoke critical thought, not end it. It does this by asking a series of challenging questions like "What would victory look like?" and "what would be the U.S. vital interest?"
16. Red herring – No – All the events and actors discussed in the text, such as the drone incident, Turkey's threats, and the FDD's position, are directly relevant to the central argument about U.S. involvement in Syria.
17. Straw men – No – The author does not refute an argument that wasn't presented. He directly quotes the pro-interventionist argument from "The Wall Street Journal op-ed page" before proceeding to critique it.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy. Its primary focus is a critique of a potential U.S. foreign policy decision.

Verdict – 85% – The text is a political opinion column, a form of writing that is inherently persuasive. However, it moves strongly into the realm of propaganda due to its heavy and deliberate use of numerous propaganda techniques to advocate for a specific political agenda (non-interventionism). The author employs name-calling ("War Party"), loaded language ("broken and bleeding country"), appeals to fear (warning of a "wider war"), and flag-waving (questioning the "U.S. vital interest") to shape the reader's emotional response. Furthermore, it casts doubt on official narratives and frames complex choices in a simple binary (diplomacy vs. military action). The sheer density of these techniques, woven together to discredit opponents and promote a particular worldview on a matter of war and peace, makes it a powerful piece of propaganda, even if it is presented as commentary.
