Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – Explanation: The text labels Hafiz Kazi as a "terrorist" ("Travis Air Force Base terrorist") before any motive is established by authorities (who state "terrorism... [is] still on the table" and call the man a "mystery"). It also uses "Muslim" in this context as a negative label.
2.  **Repetition – No** – Explanation: While the event is described, the core message (e.g., that officials are protecting Islam) is stated but not significantly repeated throughout the quoted text.
3.  **Slogans – No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrase encapsulating the core message is used prominently.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Explanation: The commentary implies that officials prioritizing "protecting the image of Islam" over "protecting the public" makes the public unsafe from "another jihad terror attack," instilling fear about both the threat and official negligence.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – Explanation: The commentary explicitly questions the credibility and motives of officials ("FBI spokeswoman Gina Swankie and Travis spokesman Airman Christian Conrad", "all too many American officials") for not immediately identifying the driver as Muslim, suggesting they are hiding the truth to protect Islam.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Explanation: The commentary exaggerates the certainty of the event being "another jihad terror attack" before the investigation has concluded (authorities state no concrete motive is known and "Terrorism... [is] still on the table"). It minimizes the possibility of other motives (like mental health) presented in the news report.
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – Explanation: While the setting is a US Air Force base, there is no explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity as a reason to support the author's viewpoint.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Explanation: Words like "terrorist," "jihad terror attack," "exploding," "blew up," "booming," "breaching security gates," and phrases like "Protecting the image of Islam, not protecting the public" are used to evoke strong negative emotions (fear, anger) and reinforce stereotypes about Muslims and terrorism.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – Explanation: The text does not attempt to disapprove of an idea by linking it to a universally hated group (e.g., Nazis).
10. **Bandwagon – No** – Explanation: There is no appeal to the popularity of the idea that this is a jihad attack or that officials protect Islam; the argument is presented based on the author's interpretation.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Explanation: The commentary reduces the complex event and the officials' actions to a single, simple cause: the driver being Muslim ("identifying this terrorist as another Muslim") and the desire to "protect[] the image of Islam." It ignores the investigation's lack of a clear motive and the officials' stated reasons for withholding information during an ongoing investigation.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – Explanation: The commentary is actually quite direct and accusatory, not vague or obscure. The news report uses standard cautious language for an ongoing investigation.
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – Explanation: The commentary does not cite an authority figure to support its claims about officials protecting Islam or the event being jihad. It relies on its own interpretation. The news report cites sources (FBI, officials, witnesses) factually.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Explanation: The commentary presents a false dilemma: officials are either "Protecting the image of Islam" OR "protecting the public," implying there are no other possible reasons (like investigative protocol, lack of confirmed information, or considering multiple motives) for their actions.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – Explanation: No phrases like "it is what it is" or "that's just common sense" are used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring – No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the incident and the commentary about the officials' handling of it. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men – No** – Explanation: The commentary attacks the officials' actual actions (withholding identification) and motives (as interpreted by the author). It doesn't misrepresent an opposing argument.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – Explanation: The author does not charge opponents (the officials) with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated wrongdoings.

**Verdict – 85% –** Explanation: The text exhibits a high likelihood of being propaganda. The core commentary (the first 4 paragraphs and the final sentence) employs multiple propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy) to advance a specific, ideologically charged narrative: that the incident was definitively "another jihad terror attack" perpetrated by a "Muslim," and that US officials deliberately concealed this due to prioritizing "protecting the image of Islam" over public safety. This narrative is asserted before the factual news report (which clearly states no motive is confirmed) and interprets official caution through this biased lens. The language is highly emotional and accusatory, aiming to provoke fear and distrust towards both the suspect (based on his religion) and government officials. While the embedded news report itself is largely factual (though selectively quoted/framed), the dominant voice and framing of the text clearly serve to promote Pamela Geller's specific viewpoint about Islam, terrorism, and government complicity, using characteristic propaganda methods to persuade rather than objectively inform.
