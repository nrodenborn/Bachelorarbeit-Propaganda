### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling – Yes**  
   Explanation: The text repeatedly labels J Street as "Kapos" (e.g., "J Street 'Kapos'", "Seriously Kapo"), comparing them to Jews forced to collaborate with Nazis—an insulting, inflammatory term.  

2. **Repetition – Yes**  
   Explanation: The term "Kapos" is used multiple times (e.g., in the headline, "To Kapos," and "Seriously Kapo") to reinforce the negative association.  

3. **Slogans – No**  
   Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans; the text relies on narrative insults.  

4. **Appeal to fear – No**  
   Explanation: The text does not instill fear against alternatives; it focuses on attacking J Street and Davis.  

5. **Doubt – Yes**  
   Explanation: The text questions J Street’s credibility, e.g., "So seriously that J Street can't decide what to do about a politician who defends a Hitler-lover," implying hypocrisy.  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes**  
   Explanation: Minimizes Farrakhan’s extremism (Davis: "it ain’t my thing") while exaggerating J Street’s collaboration ("No one forced J Street to collaborate with anti-Semites").  

7. **Flag-Waving – No**  
   Explanation: No appeals to patriotism or group identity beyond generic references to Jewish issues.  

8. **Loaded Language – Yes**  
   Explanation: Emotionally charged terms like "virulently anti-Semitic," "Hitler-lover," and "collaborate with anti-Semites" stoke outrage.  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes**  
   Explanation: Explicitly compares J Street to Nazi collaborators ("Kapos"), leveraging Holocaust imagery to disapprove of them.  

10. **Bandwagon – No**  
    Explanation: No appeal to the popularity of an idea; the text focuses on individual actions.  

11. **Causal Oversimplification – No**  
    Explanation: No complex events are oversimplified; the text narrates without attributing broad outcomes to single causes.  

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No**  
    Explanation: The text is direct and unambiguous in its accusations.  

13. **Appeal to authority – No**  
    Explanation: No external authorities are cited to validate claims; the text relies on its own assertions.  

14. **Black & white fallacy – No**  
    Explanation: No false dichotomies are presented; nuances like Davis’s deflection ("the world is so much bigger") are acknowledged.  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No**  
    Explanation: No phrases like "case closed" are used to halt discussion; the text invites scrutiny.  

16. **Red herring – No**  
    Explanation: All content relates directly to J Street, Davis, and Farrakhan; no irrelevant distractions are introduced.  

17. **Straw men – No**  
    Explanation: Arguments against J Street and Davis are based on actual quotes (e.g., Davis’s praise of Farrakhan), not misrepresentations.  

18. **Whataboutism – No**  
    Explanation: The text does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy unrelated to the core issue; it focuses on J Street’s endorsement of Davis.

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 95% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda due to its systematic use of inflammatory techniques. It employs **name-calling** ("Kapos"), **repetition** of this slur, **loaded language** ("Hitler-lover"), and **reduction ad Hitlerum** to vilify J Street, exploiting Holocaust trauma to delegitimize the group. It also **minimizes** Farrakhan’s antisemitism while **exaggerating** J Street’s actions, creating a biased narrative. The tone is polemical and emotionally manipulative, aiming to provoke outrage rather than inform. While it cites real events (e.g., Davis’s quotes), these are framed to advance a partisan agenda, with no attempt at neutrality. The 5% uncertainty reflects the presence of factual elements (e.g., Davis’s statements), but these are weaponized to serve propaganda goals.
