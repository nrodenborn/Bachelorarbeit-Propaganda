Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – The text uses neutral or descriptive terms like "gun control advocates" and "plaintiffs" without employing insulting labels.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The phrase "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times consecutively in the poll section.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries within the main argumentative text (e.g., no equivalent to "BUILD THE WALL").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the impossibility of regulating "ghost guns," suggesting criminals will easily obtain them regardless of laws, instilling fear about the futility and dangers of gun control: "3D printers make the already extremely difficult job of controlling access to guns practically impossible."; "It's difficult to see how 'ghost guns' could ever be regulated by the government."
5.  **Doubt** – No – While critical of government effectiveness, it doesn't specifically question the credibility of a person or institution in a targeted way (e.g., "Can the same be said for the Obama Administration?" is not paralleled). Criticism is more general.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The effectiveness of gun control measures is minimized or presented as impossible ("practically impossible", "laughable", "quite useless", "no more effective... than... stopping them from obtaining drugs"). The difficulty of regulation is exaggerated ("difficult, if not impossible").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – The text appeals to constitutional rights (1st & 2nd Amendment) but does not invoke patriotism, national identity, or use phrases like "We the People" in a rallying manner within the core argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged or negatively connotative words are used to describe the situation and opponents: "death blow", "ruckus", "laughable", "capitulated", "ghost guns" (implies invisibility/evasion), "game changer" (implies insurmountable shift).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally hated groups are made to disapprove of gun control or its advocates.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of the idea of unregulated gun blueprints or 3D printing. The focus is on technological inevitability and government futility, not popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text oversimplifies the complex issue of gun violence and control by heavily implying that the availability of 3D printers and blueprints alone makes *all* gun control efforts ("eliminating guns," background checks, magazine limits, registration) definitively impossible: "3D printers make the already extremely difficult job of controlling access to guns practically impossible." It ignores other potential regulatory, social, or technological solutions or mitigations.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is relatively clear in its arguments and descriptions. Terms like "ghost guns" are evocative but their meaning (unmarked, untraceable) is explained.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While quotes from figures like J. Adam Skaggs and references to the DOJ/State Department are used, they are presented as part of the narrative or opposing viewpoints, not as definitive proof solely based on the authority of the source.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text presents the situation as an absolute choice: either gun control (specifically eliminating guns or effectively regulating access) is possible, or it is completely futile ("fool's errand," "practically impossible"). It dismisses the possibility of partial regulations, mitigations, or alternative approaches having any value.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – The text employs arguments and explanations, not simplistic phrases designed to shut down critical thought (e.g., no equivalent to "It is what it is" or "That's just the way things are" applied to the core argument).
16. **Red herring** – No – The core argument focuses on the technological challenge to gun control posed by 3D printers. While mentioning drugs, it connects it to the source (gangs) of both illegal items, staying relevant to the difficulty of control. The Kavanaugh poll is a distraction but is clearly separated as a poll, not integrated into the gun control argument.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text summarizes the opposing view (gun control advocates believe the government "capitulated" and think regulation is possible) without misrepresenting it into an easily refutable extreme position.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge gun control advocates with hypocrisy. It focuses on arguing the futility of their goals based on technology and government ineffectiveness.

**Verdict – 65% –** The text exhibits several hallmarks of propaganda, primarily through **Appeal to Fear** (emphasizing the uncontrollable danger of ghost guns), **Exaggeration/Minimization** (downplaying any potential effectiveness of gun control measures as "laughable" or "useless"), **Loaded Language** (using terms like "death blow," "ruckus," "capitulated," "ghost guns"), **Causal Oversimplification** (attributing the inevitable failure of *all* gun control solely to 3D printing technology), and the **Black & White Fallacy** (presenting gun control as completely futile vs. possible). The inclusion of the repetitive Kavanaugh poll also uses **Repetition**. However, the text is grounded in a real event (the DOJ/DD settlement) and presents factual details about the case, history, and technology. It also accurately represents an opposing viewpoint (Skaggs' quote). This factual basis prevents it from being purely propagandistic, but the pervasive use of persuasive techniques to promote a specific, one-sided conclusion (that gun elimination/control is a "fool's errand") and to evoke fear and resignation pushes it significantly towards propaganda. It functions more as strong advocacy with propagandistic elements than pure disinformation.
