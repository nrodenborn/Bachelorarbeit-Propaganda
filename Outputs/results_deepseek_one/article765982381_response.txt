Based on the definitions provided, here's the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Vichy journalists" (Labeling journalists who don't support Assange as collaborators akin to the Nazi-collaborating Vichy government).
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – While themes like "silence" and persecution are central, the *same exact message* isn't repeated verbatim throughout.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Long live the Fifth Estate!" (A brief, memorable phrase rallying support for WikiLeaks/Assange).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Describing Assange's potential fate ("manufacture a reason to put him on trial and put him in prison") and the hypothetical that WikiLeaks could have prevented 9/11 instills fear about his persecution and the consequences of suppressing such platforms.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "is 'unseemly sycophancy' at work among the media?" and "The silence of what used to be the noble profession of journalism is deafening." (Questions the integrity and motives of the media).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "Fourth Estate now on life support" (Exaggerates the state of traditional journalism). "whose only 'crime' is publishing documents" (Minimizes the potential legal/ethical complexities of Assange's actions).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – References to "patriotic truth-tellers", "the U.S. and 'civilized world'", the First Amendment, and framing sources as "patriot[s]" appeal to national ideals and identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "scurrilous slander campaign", "rapacious power", "systematic brutality", "ruthless suppression", "imperial crimes", "ossified bureaucracies", "victim", "unseemly sycophancy". (Emotionally charged words and phrases).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – "Vichy journalists" explicitly compares journalists not supporting Assange to Nazi collaborators.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text focuses on the *lack* of support (silence) for Assange compared to Mindszenty, rather than appealing to its popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – "If WikiLeaks had been up and running before 9/11... perhaps averting the terrorism attacks." (Posits WikiLeaks as a simple solution to a vastly complex event).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The arguments and comparisons are presented directly, not obscured by vague language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Pope Pius XII, John Pilger, Harold Pinter, Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (Rowley & Dzakovic), and the Sam Adams Associates award to bolster arguments.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Portrays journalists as either courageous truth-tellers like Pilger/Assange/WikiLeaks sources or complicit collaborators ("Vichy journalists") who are silent. The media's silence is framed as enabling oppression.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free." (Used to definitively justify WikiLeaks' actions and shut down counter-arguments about methods or consequences).
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The extensive comparison to Mindszenty is central to the argument about persecution and silence, not an irrelevant distraction. The 9/11 hypothetical, while oversimplified, is used to argue for WikiLeaks' value.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Criticisms of media silence and government actions address positions they are perceived to hold (silence/complicity), though the characterization might be disputed.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Highlights Pope Pius XII's initial silence against the Nazis ("having failed to speak out forcefully against the Third Reich") when discussing his later condemnation of the Communist treatment of Mindszenty, implying hypocrisy or inconsistent moral courage relevant to current silence on Assange.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its core purpose is to persuade the reader that Julian Assange is a persecuted truth-teller akin to Cardinal Mindszenty, that governments (especially the US) and mainstream media are acting oppressively and hypocritically, and that WikiLeaks is uniquely vital. This is achieved through:
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** Heavy use of loaded language ("scurrilous," "rapacious," "victim," "torture") and appeals to fear (Assange's potential imprisonment, the implication that suppressing WikiLeaks endangers society like pre-9/11 failures).
*   **Framing & Fallacies:** The extended Mindszenty analogy frames Assange's situation as historical persecution. It relies heavily on Black & White fallacy (heroic truthtellers vs. complicit collaborators/silent enablers), Whataboutism (Pius XII's Nazi-era silence), Reduction ad Hitlerum ("Vichy journalists"), Causal Oversimplification (WikiLeaks preventing 9/11), and Exaggeration (media "on life support").
*   **Undermining Opposition:** It consistently uses Doubt and Name-Calling ("Vichy journalists") to attack the credibility and motives of the mainstream media and governments opposing Assange.
*   **Simplified Narrative:** It presents a clear, emotionally charged narrative of good (Assange/WikiLeaks/truth-tellers) vs. evil (oppressive governments/complicit media), minimizing complexities and using a Thought-terminating cliché ("truth shall set you free") to shut down nuance.
While based on factual events (Mindszenty's history, Assange's asylum), the text's primary function is not balanced reporting but persuasive advocacy using numerous established propaganda techniques to generate sympathy for Assange and condemnation for his perceived persecutors. The high percentage reflects the density and strategic use of these techniques throughout the text.
