### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Never-Trumpers," "GOP elite" (used pejoratively to dismiss critics).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – "It’s not coming back," "It is over," "no restoration," "no turning back" (emphasizes irreversible GOP demise).  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Build the Wall") are used.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings of China as a "geo-strategic rival" with "expansionist ambitions" and border threats.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions credibility of Bush-era policies: "What are the gains for democracy from these wars?"  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Minimizes Trump’s role in nationalism ("Trump didn’t start the fire"); exaggerates GOP failures ("failed, and are seen as having failed").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to American sovereignty: "begged for measures to control our bleeding southern border."  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Hubristic drive," "bleeding southern border," "potentially malevolent power" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis or Hitler.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Does not appeal to popularity (focuses on elite failures, not popular trends).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames NATO expansion for "a second Cold War" and trade policies for China’s rise (ignores complex global factors).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are direct; no deliberate obscurity.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites George Kennan as a "statesman" and Bono to validate critiques of institutions.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents Trump’s policies as the *only* alternative to "failed" GOP establishment approaches.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" to halt debate.  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Focus remains on GOP failures; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Criticizes actual policies (e.g., Iraq War, NATO expansion), not misrepresented positions.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Does not deflect criticism by accusing others of hypocrisy.

### Verdict – **85%** –  
**Explanation:** The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques (e.g., name-calling, fear appeals, loaded language, causal oversimplification) to advance a partisan narrative. It vilifies "Never-Trumpers" and the "GOP elite" while glorifying Trump’s policies, using emotionally charged rhetoric ("bleeding border," "hubristic drive") and oversimplified causality (e.g., blaming NATO expansion solely for renewed tensions with Russia). The goal is persuasion, not balanced analysis: it dismisses opposing viewpoints, selectively presents facts to condemn past Republican leaders, and frames Trump as the sole viable alternative. While based on real events (e.g., Iraq War, China trade), the one-sided framing, omission of counter-evidence, and reliance on emotional triggers align with propaganda. The 15% uncertainty reflects the use of verifiable historical references, though their interpretation is skewed to serve the argument.
