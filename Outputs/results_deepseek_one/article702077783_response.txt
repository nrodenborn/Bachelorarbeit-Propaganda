Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "incompetent, clueless authorities", "bumbling FBI". These are insulting labels applied to the authorities/FBI.
2.  **Repetition – No** – While the concept of an information blackout is mentioned, it is not repeated in a specific, identical phrase throughout the text. The narrative develops rather than repeats.
3.  **Slogans – No** – There is no distinct, brief, memorable phrase used as a rallying cry (like "Build the Wall"). "INFORMATION BLACKOUT" is a headline label, but not used repeatedly as a slogan within the body.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – The text strongly implies authorities are hiding crucial information (potentially a terrorist link: "ISIS foothold", "covert terrorism financing", "San Bernardino jihad attackers did the same thing") and paints the investigation as "botched" and a "stunning indictment", fostering fear of a cover-up and ongoing threat.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – Repeatedly questions the FBI's dismissal of jihad as a motive: "while the bumbling FBI has dismissed out of hand jihad as a motive, here is what we know...", questioning their investigation timeline ("comprehensive timeline, which ended up being wrong"), and their transparency ("refusing to fill in the blanks").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – "INFORMATION BLACKOUT" is an exaggeration of authorities scaling back briefings as an investigation progresses normally. Minimizes authorities' efforts ("botched investigation", "bumbling FBI", implying incompetence rather than procedural caution).
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – "This is not the Soviet Union, this is not Iran or Riyadh – this is America. Where is the outrage?" Appeals directly to American identity and values to criticize the handling of the investigation.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "savagery", "unspeakable", "incompetent, clueless", "bumbling", "botched", "stunning indictment", "dismissed out of hand", "slaughter". These words carry strong negative connotations and evoke specific emotional responses (anger, distrust, disgust).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or specific hated groups like the Vichy government are made.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – The text does not argue that an idea should be accepted because it's popular or that others are doing it.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – No** – The text does not attribute the shooting or the blackout to a single, simple cause. It lists multiple factors (ISIS claim, travel, finances, hard drive removal, FBI actions) without explicitly stating one simple cause dominates.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is actually quite direct and specific in its accusations and the details it presents (e.g., trips to the Middle East, $100k transfer, hard drive removal, body camera snippets released, timeline errors, lack of briefings). It aims for clarity in its criticism, not confusion.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Cites ISIS claims multiple times as authoritative proof ("ISIS has claimed responsibility", "ISIS does not claim credit for events that are not theirs", "They have double and tripled down"). Also cites the parallel to the San Bernardino case as authoritative precedent. Ends with an appeal to Pamela Geller's authority ("Article posted with permission from Pamela Geller. Pamela Geller's commitment to freedom...").
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents the situation as either the FBI is correct in dismissing jihad (implied incompetence/cover-up) or ISIS is telling the truth ("ISIS does not claim credit for events that are not theirs"). Downplays other possibilities (e.g., ISIS opportunism, complex non-terrorist motive).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – The text encourages questioning and investigation, rather than shutting down thought with phrases like "it is what it is" or "that's just the way things are".
16. **Red herring – No** – The details presented (ISIS claim, travel, finances, hard drive removal, FBI communication issues) are all directly related to the core arguments about motive and the information flow, not irrelevant distractions.
17. **Straw men – No** – The text attacks the FBI's actual statements and actions (dismissing jihad, scaling back briefings, timeline errors) rather than misrepresenting their position.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The text does not charge the FBI or authorities with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions or inconsistencies in a different context. It focuses on their actions *within* this specific investigation.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is not balanced reporting but to advance a specific, highly critical narrative about the authorities (especially the FBI) handling the Las Vegas shooting investigation. It uses **Name-calling**, **Appeal to fear**, **Doubt**, **Exaggeration/Minimization**, **Flag-waving**, **Loaded language**, **Appeal to authority**, and the **Black & white fallacy** very prominently to paint a picture of incompetence, potential cover-up (specifically regarding a possible jihadist motive supported by ISIS claims), and a betrayal of American transparency. The selective presentation of facts (emphasizing ISIS claims and parallels to San Bernardino while dismissing the FBI's stance), the heavy reliance on emotionally charged language, the appeal to national identity to demand outrage, and the concluding endorsement of Pamela Geller (a known controversial figure) all strongly signal a propagandistic intent to persuade the reader towards a specific, distrustful conclusion rather than objectively inform. While it raises questions about investigation transparency (a legitimate topic), the methods used overwhelmingly align with propaganda.
