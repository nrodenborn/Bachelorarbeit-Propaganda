Here are the propaganda techniques and whether they are used in the text:

Name calling – Yes – Both speakers use insulting labels to attack their opponent's arguments and character. For example, Chris Ferrara calls Robert Fastiggi’s argument “sophistical” and later refers to defenders of Amoris Laetitia as “latter-day Pharisees and legalists.” Fastiggi, in turn, calls Ferrara’s questions “clumsy and insulting.”

Repetition – Yes – Both speakers repeat their core message. Chris Ferrara repeatedly insists that Amoris Laetitia is leading to “public adulterers” being “admitted to Holy Communion.” Robert Fastiggi repeatedly states that his opponents have “failed to grasp its true meaning” and that the document is about a “move away from sin.”

Slogans – No – The text does not contain brief, memorable phrases used as slogans. The arguments are presented in longer, more complex sentences.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The technique is used to create anxiety about the consequences of the opponent's position. Chris Ferrara warns of a “moral catastrophe” and the “overthrow” of the Church’s “bimillenial discipline.” Robert Fastiggi raises the prospect of Ferrara being in “schism,” a state of grave sin for a Catholic.

Doubt – Yes – Both speakers actively work to undermine the credibility of the other. Fastiggi questions Ferrara’s legal expertise (“As a lawyer, Ferrara should have a better sense of what really counts as evidence”) and his understanding of theology. Ferrara questions Fastiggi’s comprehension (“demonstrate a pronounced lack of comprehension”).

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Both speakers exaggerate their own points and minimize their opponent's. Ferrara refers to a “growing mountain of evidence” and a “moral catastrophe,” which is an exaggeration. Fastiggi minimizes Ferrara’s evidence as “very thin evidence.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The technique is used by appealing to a shared identity, in this case, Catholic identity. Fastiggi appeals to loyalty to the Pope (“we defend the Roman Pontiff”) and questions Ferrara’s “standing in the Catholic Church.” Ferrara appeals to the identity of a defender of tradition, citing the “Church’s constant practice” and “bimillenial discipline.”

Loaded Language – Yes – Both speakers use words with strong emotional connotations. Ferrara uses phrases like “public adulterers,” “moral catastrophe,” and “fig leaf.” Fastiggi uses emotionally charged terms within a Catholic context like “bearing false witness” and “schism.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler directly, the technique of disapproving of an idea by associating it with a hated group or concept is used. Ferrara’s use of the term “Leviathan Church” associates his opponent’s position with the hated concept of an amoral, totalitarian state as described by Hobbes.

Bandwagon – Yes – The technique is used to suggest an idea is correct because it has widespread support. Ferrara explicitly does this when he says: “Tell that to the four cardinals, the 800,000 faithful, the 45 theologians and the 61 other original signers of the correctio…”

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – A complex event is attributed to a single, simple cause. Ferrara states: “A moral catastrophe is self-evidently underway and it is not possible honestly to deny its cause,” identifying Amoris Laetitia as the sole cause for a complex situation in the Church.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – While the theological arguments are complex, neither speaker appears to be using intentionally vague language to confuse the audience. They are both trying to make their respective points, however polemically.

Appeal to authority – Yes – Both speakers use authorities to support their claims. Fastiggi cites Pope Francis, Cardinal Müller, and Cardinal Schoenborn. Ferrara cites John Paul II, the “four cardinals,” and “45 theologians.”

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The argument is framed as having only two possible outcomes. Fastiggi questions Ferrara by asking if he believes the Church is a “‘Leviathan Church’ and not the Catholic Church?” The entire debate is presented as a choice between AL being perfectly orthodox (Fastiggi) or a complete disaster (Ferrara), with no middle ground.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases are used to shut down debate. Fastiggi ends one reply by saying, “I can only ask that you to study the matter more carefully with an open heart and mind,” which dismisses his opponent's argument by questioning his disposition. Ferrara does similarly, stating, “If Dr. Fastiggi wishes to continue to pretend... then I cannot help him.”

Red herring – Yes – An irrelevant topic is introduced to divert attention. Fastiggi shifts the argument from the interpretation of Amoris Laetitia to Ferrara’s personal “standing in the Catholic Church” and whether he is in a state of “schism,” a distraction from the core theological debate.

Straw men – Yes – An opponent's argument is misrepresented to be more easily attacked. Ferrara accuses Fastiggi of creating a straw man by taking his "Leviathan Church" metaphor literally: "I do not, as should be obvious, argue that this Leviathan Church actually exists."

Whataboutism – No – Neither speaker directly accuses the other of hypocrisy by pointing to a separate, unrelated failing as a way to invalidate their current argument.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a highly concentrated example of propaganda. It is not a scholarly debate seeking truth, but a polemical exchange where both participants deploy a vast arsenal of propaganda techniques to win the argument and discredit their opponent. The sheer density and variety of techniques—including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, loaded language, bandwagon, red herring, and straw man arguments—are overwhelming. Both Chris Ferrara and Robert Fastiggi are engaged in persuading an audience not through neutral reason and evidence, but through emotional appeals, attacks on credibility, and the manipulation of arguments. Ferrara frames the situation as a “moral catastrophe” caused by a single document, while Fastiggi attempts to disqualify his opponent by questioning his standing within the Church. The goal is not mutual understanding but rhetorical victory, which is the essence of propaganda.
