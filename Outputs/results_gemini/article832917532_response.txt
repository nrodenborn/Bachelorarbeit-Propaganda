Verdict – 10% – The text itself is a news report and is not inherently propaganda. Its primary function is to inform the public of an event—the delivery of the Mueller report—and to present the immediate reactions of key figures from both political parties. It maintains a neutral tone and attributes all opinions and statements to their sources.

However, several propaganda techniques are present within the direct quotes it includes, almost all of them from Senator Grassley's statement. His statement employs loaded language ("speculation and innuendo"), appeal to fear ("play into the hands of our foreign adversaries"), flag-waving, and thought-terminating clichés to frame the end of the investigation in a specific political light. The article is reporting on a political figure using propaganda, rather than being propaganda itself. The 10% likelihood accounts for the journalistic choice of which quotes to include and how much space to give them, as the lengthy and technique-filled statement from Grassley is the final voice in the article, which can subtly influence a reader's takeaway.
