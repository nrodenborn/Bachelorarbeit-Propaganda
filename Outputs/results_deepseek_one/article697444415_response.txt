Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text for each technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to the subject (FBI, police, concert organizers). Descriptions like "pigs in a corral" and "sheep" refer to the victims' situation, not the subjects of the criticism.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The core claim of "more than one shooter" is repeated multiple times: "100% more than one shooter", "every other person... have all said the same things", "multiple shooters carried out the attack". The claim about locked gates is also repeated.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as slogans within the quoted text or the article's framing (e.g., "Locked Gates Kill!" or "Multiple Shooters Now!" aren't present).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The description of the locked gates creating a situation where concertgoers were trapped like "pigs sitting in a corral" with only one exit while being shot at is used to instill fear and imply malicious intent or negligence, supporting the idea of a cover-up/conspiracy. The overall narrative builds fear about an official cover-up of a larger attack.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – Explicitly questions the official narrative and credibility: "the FBI is actively covering this up", "we are not being told what actually happened".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Uses strong, absolute language like "100% more than one shooter" which exaggerates the certainty of the claim beyond what personal testimony can provide. Describing the testimony as a "huge bombshell" and "stunning" potentially exaggerates its impact or novelty. Minimization isn't evident.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, national identity, or a specific group identity like "We the People" to rally support for the claims.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Uses emotionally charged and vivid language: "horrific attack", "shocking comments", "frantic civilians", "pigs sitting in a corral", "following the sheep", "stunning testimony", "huge bombshell", "fateful night". These words evoke strong emotions (fear, anger, victimization, revelation).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons are made to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally despised groups to discredit the official story or those involved.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Appeals to the idea that this view is widely held among victims to validate it: "every other person that I’ve talked to that did unfortunately get hit as well, have all said the same things", "correlate with various other reports", "add credence to the growing belief".
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text describes events (locked gates, multiple shooters, police directions) but doesn't explicitly claim these factors were the *simple* cause of the attack's severity or occurrence. It implies a cover-up is the cause of the public not knowing the "truth".
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – While the description of bullet trajectories ("up and down" vs. "horizontal line") is somewhat unclear and based on perception, it doesn't appear *deliberately* obscure or vague to confuse. The main claims (multiple shooters, locked gates) are stated directly.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Uses the eyewitness testimony and victim status of Rocky Palermo as authoritative evidence to support the claims of multiple shooters, locked gates, and police directions: "Las Vegas mass shooting victim Rocky Palermo... is now speaking out", "Palermo detailed", "he continued", "he shockingly concluded". His status as a victim lends credibility to his account in the narrative.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents the situation as a stark dichotomy: either the official story (single shooter, no malicious intent with exits) is true, OR there was a conspiracy involving multiple shooters, deliberately locked gates, police complicity, and an FBI cover-up. Nuance or other explanations are excluded.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical discussion (e.g., "It's obvious!", "Just common sense!", "Case closed!").
16. **Red herring** – No – The focus on the locked gates and police directions is central to the article's conspiracy narrative about the attack being facilitated or covered up, not an irrelevant distraction from the main topic (the shooting and its investigation).
17. **Straw men** – No – The article reports Palermo's testimony and the claims of a cover-up. It doesn't explicitly misrepresent or refute a specific opposing argument that wasn't made.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge its opponents (FBI, authorities) with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions or inconsistencies. It accuses them of a cover-up and negligence, but not hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits several clear propaganda techniques (Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Bandwagon, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy). Its primary purpose appears to be promoting a specific, alternative narrative about the Las Vegas shooting (multiple shooters, intentional trapping, FBI cover-up) by heavily relying on the emotional testimony of a single victim, using inflammatory language, repeating the core claims, casting doubt on official accounts, suggesting widespread belief in this alternative, and presenting it as the only alternative to an implied false official story. While based on a real person's account, the selective reporting, framing, and use of these techniques strongly indicate an intent to persuade the audience of a conspiracy viewpoint rather than neutrally report testimony. However, it stops short of some of the more extreme techniques like Name-Calling or Reduction ad Hitlerum, and it is rooted in an actual interview, preventing a higher percentage.
