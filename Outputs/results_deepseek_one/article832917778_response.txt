### Verdict – 5% – Detailed Explanation  
The text is **not propaganda** but a straightforward news report. It neutrally summarizes Mueller probe outcomes, citing official sources without emotive language, distortion, or persuasive intent. The single use of *appeal to authority* (citing DOJ officials) is standard journalistic practice for verifying facts, not manipulative. No other techniques are present. The 5% likelihood acknowledges that *any* reporting could unintentionally sway readers, but here the tone, structure, and lack of bias align with objective journalism.
