Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Illegal Alien 'Caravan'", "Crooked Hillary", "border-crashers". Insulting labels used to dehumanize migrants and opponents.  
2. **Repetition** – No – No significant repetition of identical phrases.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "#PromisesKept" and "The Trumpinator" are brief, memorable phrases reinforcing loyalty/strength.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Razor wire imagery implies migrants are dangerous threats requiring extreme measures: "They won’t be doing any of that now... no climbers anymore".  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions media credibility: "The Fake News is showing old footage", "CNN and the rest had their little fever dreams".  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates Trump’s successes ("knocked out Crooked Hillary", "beat CNN") and minimizes opposition/context (e.g., oversimplifying investigations: "Mueller and the Dossier aren’t just coming up empty").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to patriotism: "secure our Southern border", framing policies as national protection.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms: "taunting", "bravado", "border-crashers", "circling the toilet", "Leftism’s backside".  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No linkage to hated groups like Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Implicit – References Trump’s victories (e.g., primaries, election) imply popular support, but not explicit "join the crowd" appeals.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes border security solely to razor wire/Trump: "no climbers anymore under our Administration!" (ignores complex factors).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Language is direct and hyperbolic, not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Uses Trump’s statements as evidence: "This is what it really looks like...".  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents Trump as solely effective vs. ineffective opponents: "If Congress insists on dragging its feet... Trump will find other ways".  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "#PromisesKept" and "Stay Rowdy!" shut down nuance with simplistic slogans.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Irrelevant distractions: CNN’s ratings "circling the toilet", Mueller investigation, and promotion of MeWe/Facebook censorship.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Refutes exaggerated claims: "CNN and the rest had their little fever dreams about cross-border gun battles" (misrepresents criticism).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No direct accusations of hypocrisy against opponents.  

---

**Verdict – 95%** – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It systematically employs **name-calling**, **loaded language**, and **appeal to fear** to dehumanize migrants and frame border security as a crisis. It uses **slogans** ("#PromisesKept"), **black-and-white fallacies** (Trump vs. "dragging" Congress), and **causal oversimplification** (attributing border control solely to razor wire) to glorify Trump while dismissing opposition. **Doubt** and **straw men** undermine critics (media, investigators), and **red herrings** distract from policy debates. The tone is emotionally manipulative, urging allegiance ("Stay Rowdy!") and financial support ("kick in to our ‘war chest’"), aligning with partisan identity. Only minor elements (e.g., platform migration details) lack overt propaganda, but they serve the broader agenda. The text’s primary function is to persuade through emotional triggers, distortion, and us-vs-them rhetoric, not inform.
