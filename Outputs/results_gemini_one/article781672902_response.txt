**Name calling – Yes – Explanation:** The text uses numerous insulting labels to attack its subjects, such as calling the media "presstitutes" and "whores," describing AG Sessions as "weak and stupid," and referring to Mueller as a "proven corrupt person." The title itself, "The Brennan-Rosenstein-Mueller–Comey-Presstitute," is a compound insult.

**Repetition – Yes – Explanation:** The core message that "Russiagate" is a conspiracy orchestrated by the "military/security complex" is repeated throughout the text. For example: "Russiagate is an orchestration." and later, "After two years the only evidence we have of Russiagate is that it is a conspiracy against President Trump and the American people."

**Slogans – No – Explanation:** The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan. It favors long-form arguments and complex, insulting names over short, catchy phrases meant for chanting or easy recall.

**Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation:** The text repeatedly instills fear by suggesting that the alternative to its viewpoint is global catastrophe. For example: "the danger of nuclear war is today far higher than ever" and "The danger is real that the Democrats’ Russiagate “investigation” aided and abetted by the presstitute media will result in nuclear Armageddon."

**Doubt – Yes – Explanation:** The entire article is an exercise in casting doubt on the credibility of the Russiagate investigation and its key figures. For example: "We do not know if Manafort is guilty or is simply a victim of Mueller’s frameup and an incompetent jury."

**Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation:** The text exaggerates threats and minimizes crimes. Exaggeration: "The entire world looks at America and Israel, and what does the world see? Two countries... distrusted and universally hated". Minimization: It downplays Manafort's alleged crimes by stating, "Manafort was found guilty not of Russiagate, but of income tax evasion and misrepresenting his financial position on a loan application," framing them as lesser issues.

**Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation:** The text appeals to American identity and patriotism by framing the conflict as an attack on the populace and democracy itself. Example: "it is an endorsement of the American people who in their distress... elected Donald Trump their President" and warning of a "conspiracy to overthrow democracy in America."

**Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation:** The text is saturated with emotionally charged and stereotypical language to influence the reader's perception. Examples include "hegemonic neoconservatives," "Trump-hating presstitutes," "mass murder," and "rabid Russiaphobia."

**Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – Explanation:** The text disapproves of an idea by associating it with a hated group or concept. It compares the Gaza Strip to "the largest concentration camp ever in the world," a clear reference to Nazi practices to demonize Israel.

**Bandwagon – No – Explanation:** The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea. Instead, it presents its viewpoint as a lonely truth fighting against a massive, popular conspiracy, which is the opposite of the bandwagon technique.

**Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation:** The text presents a single, simple cause for the entire complex Russiagate investigation. Example: "Russiagate is an orchestration. It is the response of the military/security complex to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign statement that he intended to normalize relations with Russia."

**Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanation:** The author is not vague; the text makes very direct, specific, and bold accusations against named individuals and groups, even if those accusations are unsubstantiated. The style is accusatory, not obscure.

**Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation:** The text uses the support of perceived authorities as evidence for its claims. For example: "Let Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz tell you:" and "President Eisenhower warned the American people about this likely outcome in 1961 to no avail."

**Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation:** The text presents only two options: either accept the author's narrative of a deep-state coup, or face global destruction. Example: "If Trump is defeated... what happens? It will be the end of life on earth."

**Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation:** The text uses phrases to discourage critical thought and present its conclusions as final. For instance, after making a sweeping claim, it states: "The US military/security complex will not permit any normalization of relations with Russia. Period."

**Red herring – Yes – Explanation:** The text introduces irrelevant material to distract from the main point. When discussing Manafort's loan application charge, it distracts by bringing up the 2008 financial crisis: "...what about the mortgage-backed derivative crisis was the misrepresentation of mortgage applicants on the loan documents by the companies issuing the mortgages."

**Straw men – Yes – Explanation:** The text refutes a distorted version of its opponents' arguments. It claims Mueller's focus on Manafort's financial crimes proves the Russiagate investigation is a sham, misrepresenting the investigation's actual mandate, which allowed for prosecuting any crimes uncovered. Example: "Mueller’s investigation of Manafort has nothing to do with the Russiagate story line."

**Whataboutism – Yes – Explanation:** The text deflects criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy. It counters the idea of Russian election meddling by claiming, "In other words, the real election meddling is being done by the Russiagate 'investigation'."

***

**Verdict – 100% – Explanation:** The text is unequivocally propaganda. It employs at least 16 of the 18 listed techniques, often multiple times and with great intensity. The entire piece is structured not as a reasoned argument but as a polemic designed to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions. It is built on a foundation of **Causal Oversimplification** (the entire Russiagate scandal is simply a plot by the "military/security complex") and uses constant **Repetition** of this conspiracy. It relies heavily on aggressive **Name-calling** ("presstitutes," "whores") and emotionally **Loaded Language** to demonize any person or institution that contradicts its narrative. A powerful **Appeal to Fear** is used throughout, with repeated warnings of "nuclear Armageddon" and the "end of life on earth" as the only alternative to its preferred outcome. The author systematically uses **Doubt**, **Straw Men**, and **Whataboutism** to dismantle opposing views and deflect accusations. The argument is presented as a stark **Black & White Fallacy**, forcing a choice between a heroic Trump fighting a cabal and a world doomed to destruction. The sheer density and combination of these techniques confirm that the text's primary purpose is not to inform but to indoctrinate the reader into a specific, highly conspiratorial worldview.
