1. Name calling – No – The text does not use any insulting labels to attack a person, group, or idea. It uses formal titles and neutral descriptions.
2. Repetition – No – While the core subject is revisited from different angles, the text does not repeat the same message or phrase over and over to enforce an idea.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text reports on the US State Department issuing a health alert that is designed to create caution and fear for safety purposes. Explanation: "While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source. Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text introduces an expert opinion that questions the credibility of one of the main theories. Explanation: "Dr Toby Heys told the New Scientist in 2017 that an infrasound attack wouldn't be 'very covert' as a 'large array of subwoofers' would be needed."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text reports on the incident using official and medical terminology like "mild traumatic brain injury" and "subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations," which are descriptive rather than deliberately exaggerated or minimized.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions nations like the US and China, but it does so to provide factual context, not to appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses the term "'sonic attack'" repeatedly. While often in quotes, this phrase is emotionally charged and suggests a deliberate, hostile, and invisible act of aggression, framing the event in a dramatic way.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to hated figures like Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is true because it is popular. In fact, it highlights the uncertainty surrounding the event.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does the opposite; it explicitly states that the cause is unknown and presents several complex potential causes (sonic attacks, electromagnetic weapons, flawed spy devices).
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is not deliberately vague. It is reporting on a situation where the facts are unclear and quotes descriptions that are inherently vague, such as "subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure."
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text relies heavily on statements from official sources to establish its claims and credibility. Explanation: "The state department has issued a health alert to its citizens in the country..." and "The US Secretary of Mike Pompeo has said he is concerned about the 'serious health incident'..."
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text avoids this fallacy by presenting multiple theories about the cause of the health issues, rather than limiting the options to just two.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any clichés that would shut down critical thought. It presents a situation with many open questions.
16. Red herring – No – The material presented, such as the context of US-China relations and the previous incident in Cuba, is relevant to understanding the significance of the event.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that wasn't made. It presents theories and then introduces expert skepticism about them.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any party of hypocrisy. The comparison to the Cuba incident is used to provide context and show a pattern, not to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 20% – The text is primarily structured as a news report, not a piece of overt propaganda. It adheres to journalistic conventions by attributing information to specific sources (State Department, Mike Pompeo, Dr. Toby Heys), presenting multiple competing theories, and acknowledging uncertainty ("not sure what has caused the employee's symptoms"). However, it contains elements that give it a propagandistic flavor. The headline and repeated use of the loaded phrase "'sonic attack'" frame the incident in the most alarming way possible, immediately priming the reader to think of a deliberate, hostile act by a foreign power. While the use of "Appeal to authority" is standard for journalism, it is also a key tool of propaganda, and the article's narrative is built almost entirely on the statements of US government officials. The inclusion of a skeptical voice (Dr. Heys) mitigates this, but the overall framing still leans towards the dramatic "attack" narrative. Therefore, while not pure propaganda, the article's framing and word choice serve to amplify a narrative of fear and suspicion that aligns with a specific geopolitical viewpoint.
