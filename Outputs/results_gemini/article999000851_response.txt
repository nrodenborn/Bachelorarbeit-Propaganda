1. Name calling – Yes – The poll option "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass" attacks Acosta by labeling his behavior with the insult "like a child."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text promotes "Truth Uncensored" updates, a brief and memorable phrase designed to sound appealing.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear about the future of press freedom by stating that the media "might have won a battle, but lost the war" and that reporters can now have their passes revoked "without having a leg to stand on in terms of due process."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions Acosta's credibility as a professional journalist by describing his actions as "antics," "misbehavior," and stating he "argued with Trump instead of asking questions."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes CNN's legal victory by framing it as having "won a battle, but lost the war," while exaggerating Acosta's actions by calling them "antics and confrontations."
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions the First Amendment and the US Constitution in a legal context but does not use patriotism to persuade the audience.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "antics," "misbehavior," and "confrontations" to create a negative impression of Acosta.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular; in fact, it criticizes the "mainstream media outlets that had joined CNN."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue with the line, "Thanks to Jim Acosta, all White House correspondents have to adhere to the new rules."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is biased but its arguments and presentation of events are direct, not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from the letter by White House officials Sanders and Shine to legitimize the claim that the new rules were a necessary response to Acosta's behavior.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents only two distinct options, "Yes, he should have gotten it back" versus the loaded option "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass," ignoring any possible nuanced positions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase in the poll, "you can't act like a child and keep your pass," is a simplistic and dismissive statement that discourages critical thought on the complex issues of press freedom and due process.
16. Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of a poll and an email sign-up for "Truth Uncensored" serves as a distraction from the substantive details of the new rules, shifting the reader's focus to a simple emotional judgment of Acosta.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text creates a straw man by claiming the media celebrated the White House "backing down," then refutes this simplified "victory" narrative by arguing they actually "lost the war," misrepresenting the media's more complex legal and procedural focus.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses its criticism directly on Acosta and CNN and does not deflect from another topic by charging them with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it reports on factual events (Acosta's pass being restored, new rules being implemented), it does so with a clear and aggressive bias. The purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of Jim Acosta, CNN, and the "mainstream media." This is achieved through a potent combination of propaganda techniques, including loaded language ("antics," "misbehavior"), causal oversimplification (blaming Acosta for all the new rules), and name-calling ("act like a child"). The structure of the article, particularly the inclusion of a poll with repeated questions and a black & white fallacy in its answers, is a deliberate tool to manipulate audience opinion and collect user data under the guise of engagement. The consistent use of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to shape perception rather than report neutrally.
