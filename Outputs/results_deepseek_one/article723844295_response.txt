Here's the analysis of the text using the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – **No** – No insulting labels are directly applied to specific subjects/objects within the quoted text.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Perry repeats variations of "nothing adds up" and emphasizes waiting ("waiting and waiting and waiting", "We’ve all been waiting, and I’m waiting, too").
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as slogans within the quoted text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Perry links the attack to ISIS infiltration via the southern border ("ISIS terrorists... infiltrated the U.S. via the southern border"), invoking fear of terrorism and border security failures.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Perry repeatedly casts doubt on the official narrative ("Americans still have no idea what happened", "something is not adding up", "nothing adds up", "covering up a big story").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – While Perry makes a serious claim, the text doesn't clearly show him exaggerating his evidence or minimizing counter-evidence beyond casting doubt. The headline's "shocking claim" could be seen as exaggeration, but it's the outlet's framing, not Perry's direct quote.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While discussing terrorism and national security, Perry doesn't explicitly appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Words like "shocking claim", "devastating", "incredulous", "covering up", and "irresponsible" are used to evoke strong emotional reactions (outrage, suspicion, sympathy).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Perry doesn't argue his point based on the popularity of the idea.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Perry implies a simple cause (ISIS infiltration via the border) for the complex event of the Las Vegas shooting, dismissing the official investigation's findings ("lone gunman, again, something is not adding up").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Perry uses vague terms like "credible evidence", "credible information", "potential terrorist infiltration", "possible terrorist nexus", and refuses to share specifics when challenged ("we’re gonna have to wait… until the situation develops").
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Perry cites no external authority to support his claim beyond his own belief in the evidence he claims to have seen.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – The text doesn't explicitly present only two absolute choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Perry uses "nothing adds up" multiple times to dismiss the official narrative without engaging critically with its details or Lombardo's counter-arguments.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The discussion stays focused on the evidence (or lack thereof) for the terrorism claim vs. the official narrative.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Perry doesn't directly misrepresent Lombardo's or the investigators' arguments. Lombardo directly challenges his lack of evidence.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Perry doesn't accuse his critics of hypocrisy to deflect from his own claims.

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits strong characteristics of propaganda. It centers on an unsubstantiated claim (ISIS involvement via the border) promoted by Rep. Perry using several key techniques: **Appeal to Fear** (linking the attack to border security threats), **Doubt** (casting suspicion on the official investigation), **Causal Oversimplification** (blaming border infiltration), **Obfuscation** (vague claims of "credible evidence" without specifics), and **Thought-terminating clichés** ("nothing adds up"). The headline ("shocking claim") and use of **Loaded Language** further sensationalize the story and prime the audience for suspicion. While it includes a counter-argument (Lombardo demanding evidence and citing the official investigation), the framing, headline, and focus on Perry's unsupported allegations strongly push a specific, fear-based narrative that aligns with broader political agendas (border security, distrust of government) without providing verifiable facts. The lack of concrete evidence presented for the central claim is the most significant propagandistic element. The inclusion of Lombardo's challenge prevents a higher percentage.
