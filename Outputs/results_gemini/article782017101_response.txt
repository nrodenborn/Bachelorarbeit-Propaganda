Name calling – Yes – The author labels McCarrick and others as “perverts in the clergy” and refers to internal enemies as a “fifth column.”

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly blames the Second Vatican Council and its spirit of “aggiornamento” for the Church’s problems, hammering home this central point.

Slogans – Yes – The title itself, “Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II,” acts as a slogan framing the entire argument. The phrase “the spirit of Vatican II” is also used as a pejorative, memorable label for the problems discussed.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear by framing the issue as a demonic attack on the Church, stating, “cast into Hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls,” and warning of a “fifth column working to tear down the walls from within.”

Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on the credibility and motives of the post-Vatican II Church, asking, “How was he allowed to go on molesting young priests and seminarians when virtually the entire Church hierarchy knew what he was up to?”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by stating, “there’s only one possible explanation: the Second Vatican Council.” It also minimizes other potential factors contributing to the crisis.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific Catholic identity, particularly a traditionalist one, with phrases like “As Catholics, we ask St. Michael…” and addressing “Those who love our Holy Mother.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like “depraved,” “perverts,” “demonic,” and describes the modernizing Church as “lecherous and pathetic” to evoke strong negative feelings.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses the same logic by associating the internal problems with historical enemies hated by the target audience, such as “heretics like Arius, Luther, and Hans Kung,” and placing the modernizers in the same category.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to popularity. In fact, it does the opposite, framing its position as a courageous, counter-cultural stance against the mainstream post-Vatican II Church.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The entire premise of the article is a causal oversimplification, blaming the complex, multi-faceted crisis of clerical abuse and institutional corruption on a single cause: “there’s only one possible explanation: the Second Vatican Council.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s argument, while simplistic, is presented directly and clearly. The text is not intentionally vague; its goal is to state a very clear, albeit controversial, cause-and-effect relationship.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites Pope Paul IV’s supposed reaction to the council (“This holy old boy doesn’t realise what a hornet’s nest he’s stirring up”) to lend weight to its negative view of Vatican II.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark dichotomy between the pre-Vatican II Church (good, traditional) and the post-Vatican II Church (bad, modernist, demonic). It frames the situation as a simple choice between tradition and the “vices of modernity.”

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like “The answer is, ultimately, demonic” serve to shut down further rational inquiry into the complex institutional and psychological reasons for the scandal, replacing them with a simple, supernatural explanation.

Red herring – Yes – The discussion about why the “liberal press” might not have covered the story because it would involve “outing a closeted gay man” distracts from the central issue of why the Church hierarchy failed to act, introducing an external group (the media) to criticize.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified version of a counter-argument by stating, “It was not supposed (as some have claimed) to simply update the liturgy from its last redesign in 1570,” which is an oversimplification of the purpose and defense of the Council, making it easier to attack.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy. Its focus is a direct, sustained attack on its chosen target (the legacy of Vatican II).

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or present a balanced analysis, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly biased conclusion through a barrage of rhetorical and emotional tactics. The piece is built upon a foundation of Causal Oversimplification, reducing a complex, decades-long crisis to a single cause (Vatican II). It heavily employs a Black & White Fallacy, framing the issue as a battle between a pure, traditional past and a corrupt, demonic present. This framework is reinforced with a constant stream of Loaded Language ("perverts," "depraved," "lecherous"), Name-Calling ("fifth columnists"), and Appeals to Fear (invoking Satan and the "ruin of souls"). The author attempts to discredit the entire post-conciliar Church by casting Doubt on its leadership and using a form of Reduction ad Hitlerum to lump modernizers in with historical heretics. The argument is designed to bypass critical thought by using Thought-Terminating Clichés ("The answer is... demonic") and to appeal to the in-group identity of traditionalist Catholics through Flag-Waving. The sheer density and combination of these techniques (15 out of the 18 listed) demonstrate that the text's intent is not objective discourse but forceful indoctrination into a particular worldview.
