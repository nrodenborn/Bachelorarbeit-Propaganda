Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "illegal alien criminals", "rapists and child sex offenders". These are insulting labels applied to the subjects of the ICE raids.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – While themes are reinforced, there isn't a specific phrase or message repeated verbatim throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – The text doesn't use a brief, memorable phrase designed for easy recall like "Build the Wall".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text emphasizes the danger of criminals ("rapists and child sex offenders") escaping arrest and links the mayor's actions to facilitating felonies ("tipping off criminals committing a felony"), instilling fear about the consequences of her warning.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Schaaf refuses to say how she learned about the ICE raids..." and "Whatever the leak pipeline looked like, it's good odds that it began with Obama holdovers..." directly question the mayor's credibility and the source of her information.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – **Exaggeration:** Claiming the story "just keeps getting worse" without presenting significant new facts beyond the emails. Labeling *all* targets of the raids as "rapists and child sex offenders" or "criminals committing a felony" is an extreme generalization. **Minimization:** Downplaying the mayor's stated motivation ("I felt that it was my duty to share the information") by immediately shifting focus to potential "Obama holdovers".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While the text deals with law enforcement and national sovereignty, it doesn't explicitly appeal to patriotism or national identity as a primary argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Widespread use: "illegal alien criminals", "rapists and child sex offenders", "shocked the nation", "ensconced", "tipping off criminals", "admits that it is aware of their status", "committing a felony". These words carry strong negative connotations and appeal to emotion.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – While "Obama holdovers" is used negatively, it doesn't explicitly compare them or their actions to universally despised groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text doesn't argue that the mayor's actions are wrong because they are unpopular or that an opposing view is right because it's popular. It implies collective action by businesses ("some Oakland businesses got a head start") but doesn't use this as the primary appeal.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – "Whatever the leak pipeline looked like, it's good odds that it began with Obama holdovers ensconced in the government." This attributes a complex information leak to a single, politically convenient cause ("Obama holdovers") without evidence.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is relatively direct in its accusations and claims, even if speculative. It doesn't rely on deliberately unclear expressions to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – The text cites emails obtained via public records, but it doesn't invoke the support of a specific authority figure or institution as evidence for its claims. It quotes the mayor and cites the law, but these are the subjects of criticism, not authorities backing the author's argument.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – The text frames the situation as: Either businesses are completely unaware of their employees' status, OR by receiving a warning they admit guilt and are committing felonies ("Any business that tips off illegal aliens admits that it is aware of their status."). It presents warning employees as inherently proving criminal knowledge and intent, ignoring other possibilities.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – The text doesn't use simplistic phrases to shut down discussion. It attempts to build an argument, albeit a biased one.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The focus remains on the mayor's actions, the leak, and the alleged criminality involved. While it introduces the legal definition of harboring, this is directly used to accuse the mayor and businesses, not to distract from a different point.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text doesn't misrepresent the mayor's defense ("I felt that it was my duty to share the information") or create a weaker version to attack. It directly attacks her actions and motivations as stated or implied.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text doesn't charge the mayor or her supporters with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated actions of their own side. It focuses solely on the incident described.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs numerous propaganda techniques: **Name Calling** ("illegal alien criminals", "rapists"), **Appeal to Fear** (dangerous criminals escaping), **Doubt** (questioning the mayor's source), **Exaggeration/Minimization** (labeling all targets as serious criminals, minimizing her stated duty), **Loaded Language** (throughout, e.g., "tipping off criminals"), **Causal Oversimplification** (blaming "Obama holdovers"), and **Black & White Fallacy** (businesses either ignorant or felons). The language is overwhelmingly emotive and negative, designed to provoke outrage against the mayor and those warned. It presents speculation ("good odds") as near-certainty, uses extreme generalizations, interprets actions in the most criminal light possible, and frames the issue in a highly polarized, us-vs-them manner consistent with persuasive messaging aimed at shaping perception rather than providing a balanced factual report. While it cites some factual elements (the mayor's tweet, email existence, the harboring law), these are used selectively and embedded within a heavily biased narrative employing classic propaganda devices.
