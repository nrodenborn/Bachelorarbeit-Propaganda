Here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique, followed by the verdict:

**Analysis:**
1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "alien to the Catholic Faith", "neo-pagan society", "sexual depravity", "plague of divorce". These are insulting labels applied to opposing views and societal trends.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage" is repeated multiple times, reinforcing the core message.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage" functions as a brief, memorable phrase encapsulating their stance.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "causing 'rampant confusion'", "will spread 'a plague of divorce' in the Church", "sexual depravity is increasingly spreading", "divorce has become a plague". These instill fear about the consequences of the opposing interpretation.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Some of these norms... give 'implicit approval' of divorce and of sexual activity outside a valid marriage", "causing 'rampant confusion'", "alien' to the Church’s entire faith and Tradition". This questions the credibility and orthodoxy of the norms implementing *Amoris Laetitia*.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "plague of divorce", "rampant confusion", "sexual depravity". These exaggerate the scale and nature of the problems attributed to the opposing view.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage", "constant truths of the Church", "Church’s entire faith and Tradition", "Successors of the Apostles". Appeals strongly to Catholic identity and tradition.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "alien", "neo-pagan society", "plague", "sexual depravity", "rampant confusion", "contrary to Divine Revelation", "allowance to sin". These terms carry strong negative emotional weight and stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis or similar universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Listing the growing number of signatories ("bringing the total... to eight bishops and one cardinal", "the following prelates have signed", "brings the number of signatories to nine") and quoting Schneider's call for "greater public support" appeals to the idea of growing popularity/acceptance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes "rampant confusion" and the potential spread of a "plague of divorce" primarily to certain pastoral norms implementing *Amoris Laetitia*, simplifying complex societal and theological issues.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is relatively clear in stating its objections, though terms like "discernment" and "pastoral accompaniment" are critiqued as vague by the bishops. The text itself isn't *using* intentional vagueness to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Relies heavily on the authority of bishops ("His Excellency", "Successors of the Apostles", "Our conscience as bishops", "We were forced by our conscience... of the Successors of the Apostles") and divine authority ("God decides the time", "contrary to Divine Revelation", "before God who will judge us") to validate the position.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as immutable truth vs. error ("alien to the Catholic Faith", "contrary to Divine Revelation", "allowance to sin"), with little room for nuance or alternative interpretations within orthodoxy.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Phrases like "immutable truths", "constant truths of the Church", "contrary to Divine Revelation", and "Successors of the Apostles" are used to shut down debate by positioning the signatories' view as unquestionably authoritative and divinely mandated.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on the theological disagreement about marriage, divorce, and communion. It doesn't introduce significantly irrelevant material to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Accuses the norms implementing *Amoris Laetitia* of giving "implicit approval" of divorce and extramarital sex, and being an "allowance to sin". This misrepresents the nuanced arguments of those supporting the pastoral application of *Amoris Laetitia*, which focuses on conscience and gradualness, not approval of sin.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not charge its opponents with hypocrisy by pointing to their other actions or beliefs.

**Verdict – 65% –** The text exhibits a significant number of propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Bandwagon, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-Terminating Clichés, Straw Men). It frames a complex theological debate in highly emotional, polarized, and fear-based terms, using the authority of bishops and tradition to delegitimize an opposing interpretation while simplifying causes and consequences. While it reports factual events (a bishop signing a statement) and quotes sources, the overwhelming use of these persuasive techniques aimed at discrediting one view and promoting another without nuanced discussion pushes it strongly towards propaganda. The 35% uncertainty acknowledges the factual reporting element and the context of an internal religious debate where strong doctrinal language is common.
