Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text labels those who hold modern Catholic views on the death penalty as followers of a "new man-centered conciliar religion" and describes their thinking as "shallow." It also labels secular opponents as "materialists."
2.  Repetition – Yes – The central message that the death penalty was instituted by God is repeated constantly throughout the text, starting from the title and the opening paragraphs and reinforced with examples from Adam, Noah, Moses, and Christ.
3.  Slogans – Yes – The title itself, "The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself," serves as a brief, memorable phrase that encapsulates the entire argument. The call to action, "Isn't it time to subscribe to the 'paper of record' for the traditional Catholic counterrevolution?" also functions as a slogan for the publication.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that abandoning the death penalty leads to severe negative consequences, such as a dramatic rise in murder rates, a "decline in the Faith," and criminals being more likely to "die in their sins" without the threat of swift execution.
5.  Doubt – Yes – The text actively works to create doubt about the validity of modern Catholic teaching and the judgment of recent popes, stating, "To illustrate how shallow Catholic thinking on the death penalty has become and how far it has deviated from the age-old doctrine of the Church..."
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the issue of executing innocent people by stating that such injustices "can be dismissed as irrelevant to the argument." Conversely, it exaggerates the spiritual benefits of execution, suggesting a repentant criminal "could go straight to heaven!"
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific group identity—that of "traditional Catholic"—by framing the argument as a defense of the "age-old doctrine of the Church" and a "traditional Catholic counterrevolution" against modern deviations.
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged and biased language, such as "new man-centered conciliar religion," "fruitless, guilty 'vengeance'," and "shallow Catholic thinking" to frame the opposition negatively.
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare its opponents or their ideas to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text argues against the current popular trend, acknowledging that "growing numbers of Catholics" and many nations oppose the death penalty. It does not claim its position is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text draws a direct causal link between a decline in executions and a rise in murder rates and a decline in faith, stating, "What leaps to the eye from the mounting statistics is that decline in the exercise of the death penalty has kept close pace with decline in the Faith and church attendance," ignoring numerous other complex societal factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text's argument, while one-sided, is presented directly and with assertive clarity. It does not attempt to confuse the audience with vague or obscure language.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – This is the primary technique used. The entire argument is built upon the unquestionable authority of God, the Bible (Genesis, Deuteronomy, Romans, etc.), and selected Popes (Pius XII, Leo XIII) to assert that the death penalty is a divine mandate.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the issue as a simple choice between two extremes. The opening line, "TO ARGUE AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY is to contend with constituted reality," frames the debate as accepting God's will or fighting against reality itself, leaving no room for nuanced positions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The core premise, that the death penalty was "instituted by God Himself," is used as a final, unarguable statement intended to end critical discussion. Phrases like "dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return" are also used to reinforce a sense of divine, inescapable finality.
16. Red herring – No – While the text brings up many historical examples (e.g., stoning for blasphemy), they are all used to support the central thesis that capital punishment has a long, divinely sanctioned history. It does not introduce truly irrelevant topics to distract from the main argument.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the arguments of opponents by simplifying their position to being concerned only with "the physical safety of society" or deterrence. This ignores the complex moral, ethical, and human rights arguments that are central to the modern abolitionist stance.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text directly attacks its opponents' views rather than deflecting criticism by pointing out their hypocrisy on another issue.

***

Verdict – 95% – This text is an exemplary piece of propaganda. Its purpose is not to foster a balanced, critical understanding of the complex issue of capital punishment, but to indoctrinate the reader into accepting a single, absolute viewpoint. The entire argument is constructed upon a foundational Appeal to Authority (God and the Bible), which is presented as infallible and beyond question. This is used to create a Black & White Fallacy where any opposition is framed as an argument against God and reality itself.

The author employs numerous other techniques to reinforce this position, including Name Calling and Loaded Language ("new man-centered conciliar religion," "shallow thinking") to discredit any dissenting voices within the Catholic Church. It creates a Straw Man argument by misrepresenting the abolitionist position as being solely concerned with societal safety, thereby ignoring and dismissing the core ethical and moral objections. Furthermore, it uses Causal Oversimplification to link a decline in executions to a rise in crime, a classic propaganda tactic that preys on fear. The text is not designed to persuade through reason but to compel belief through divine authority, emotional manipulation, and the discrediting of all opposition.
