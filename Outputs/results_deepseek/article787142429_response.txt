### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to Kavanaugh or the accuser; neutral terms like "the woman" and "nominee" are used.  
2. **Repetition** – No – The core allegation is stated once, and Kavanaugh’s denial is quoted once; no redundant phrasing.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Make America Great Again") appear.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text reports facts without instilling fear about alternatives (e.g., no warning about consequences of confirming Kavanaugh).  
5. **Doubt** – No – The text neutrally presents accusations and denials without explicitly questioning credibility (e.g., "Kavanaugh denies it happened" is factual).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Descriptions are specific but not inflated (e.g., "held a woman down, covered her mouth") or downplayed; Kavanaugh’s denial is direct but not dismissive.  
7. **Flag-waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Dropped on the last days" implies strategic timing; "character assassination" (from Severino) is emotionally charged.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association of Kavanaugh or the accuser with universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Cites "65 women... defended his character" to imply broad support, suggesting his confirmation aligns with popular opinion.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified cause-effect claims (e.g., the allegation isn’t blamed solely on politics without evidence).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are clear (e.g., timeline, actions described); no ambiguous language.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Carrie Severino cites "over 60 women" and their letter to vouch for Kavanaugh’s integrity, using their authority as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomy (e.g., the text doesn’t frame the confirmation as "confirm Kavanaugh or oppose all women").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Severino’s "nothing more than a last-minute attempt at character assassination" shuts down scrutiny by reducing the allegation to a trope.  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions; all details relate directly to the allegation or defense.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of arguments; quotes reflect actual positions.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no deflection like "What about Clinton’s accusers?").

### Verdict – 20% –   
The text is primarily **factual reporting**, citing sources (NYDN, New Yorker, Breitbart) and presenting both allegations ("held a woman down") and defenses ("65 women defended his character"). However, it includes **one attributed propagandistic element**: Carrie Severino’s quote uses *loaded language* ("character assassination"), *bandwagon* (citing 60+ women), and a *thought-terminating cliché* to dismiss the accusation. This quote is clearly attributed to a partisan source (Judicial Crisis Network), so the article itself isn’t propagandizing—it’s reporting her statement neutrally. The core narrative avoids emotional manipulation, exaggeration, or fallacies, maintaining balance. Thus, the text is 80% neutral news and 20% propagandistic *only* in its inclusion of Severino’s rhetoric.
