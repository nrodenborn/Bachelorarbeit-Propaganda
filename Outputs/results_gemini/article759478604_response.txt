1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents with insulting terms, for example, calling the proponents of the new changes the “despots of the New Paradigm” and “anti-Catholic revolutionaries.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The central message that “Cor orans” is the end of contemplative life is repeated throughout the text. It begins with the title “Cor Orans is the Death-Knell of Carmel,” is echoed by Sister T who calls it the “death-knell of Carmel” and a “disaster,” and is reinforced by the author’s concluding analysis.

3. Slogans – Yes – The title itself, “Cor Orans is the Death-Knell of Carmel,” serves as a brief, dramatic, and memorable phrase that encapsulates the entire argument of the piece.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by presenting the document as a “disaster” that will lead to the “death-knell of Carmel” and the end of “contemplative monastic life.” Sister T’s comments are explicitly described as “frightening.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively questions the credibility and motives of the Vatican officials responsible for the document, suggesting their actions are a “vicious persecution” and part of a plan by “anti-Catholic revolutionaries.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to describe the document’s effects, calling it the “death-knell,” and the motives behind it “totalitarian fantasies.” It also minimizes the stated intentions of the Vatican officials, reducing their position to a simple desire to destroy tradition.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific religious identity by contrasting the “2000-year-old tradition of religious life” and the intentions of founders like “Our Holy Mother St. Teresa” with the new path of the “Second Vatican Council,” framing loyalty to the former as true faith.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to evoke a strong negative reaction, such as “disaster,” “vicious persecution,” “totalitarian fantasies,” and “stamped back into the frost of Vatican II’s perpetual winter.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses the same technique by disapproving of the new changes by associating them with a group hated by the target audience: “Given the Marxist leanings of the recent crop of Fathers General, it seems clear that what can be expected by ‘ongoing formation’ is, in essence, some form of political indoctrination.”

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea. In fact, it does the opposite, championing the small number of “holdouts” against the larger, allegedly failing trend of the post-Vatican II Church.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents the decline in the number of nuns in European federations as a direct and sole result of adopting the post-Vatican II changes, ignoring other complex social, cultural, and economic factors that affect religious vocations. It calls this path the “death spiral.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s position and argument are direct and clear. The language is emotionally charged but not deliberately obscure or confusing.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on the authority of insiders and revered figures to make its case, such as “Sister T, fully professed and a senior member of the monastery’s council,” the historical abbot “Dom Paul Delatte, OSB,” and the founder “Our Holy Mother St. Teresa.”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between only two options, quoting Dom Paul Delatte to frame it as a choice between “the world or Our Lord, as mutually exclusive alternatives,” and implying that “Cor orans” represents “the world.”

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses highly charged, simplistic phrases that frame the issue in such extreme terms as to discourage nuanced discussion. For example, stating “The Vatican presents a choice: the world, or Christ” shuts down any possibility of a middle ground or a more complex reality.

16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central argument against “Cor orans” and the direction of the Church. Even its attacks on various figures are used to support this main point rather than to distract from it.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes a simplified and misrepresented version of the opponent's argument, stating that the Vatican is prioritizing “just Vatican II” over “the charism of the order, nor the rule, nor the Patristic tradition.” This is an oversimplification designed to be easily dismissed.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The author charges Pope Francis with hypocrisy by writing, “In this day and age, when Pope Francis is proclaiming, if not Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, then at least license and ‘choice’ for all, plus the ‘rights’ of women, here our rights are completely taken away.”

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or present a balanced view, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative position against the Vatican document “Cor orans.” It achieves this by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. The entire piece is built on a foundation of emotional manipulation, using Loaded Language (“death-knell,” “vicious persecution”), Appeal to Fear, and Name-Calling (“despots”). It constructs a stark Black & White Fallacy (the authentic tradition vs. the destructive “New Paradigm”) and supports this with Appeals to Authority (Sister T, St. Teresa) while simultaneously casting Doubt on the motives of the opposing authorities. Logical fallacies like Causal Oversimplification (blaming Vatican II for all numerical decline) and Straw Men (misrepresenting the Vatican's position) are used to make the author's argument appear more logical than it is. The sheer density and combination of these techniques indicate a deliberate effort to shape opinion and incite opposition rather than to foster understanding.
