Name calling – No – The text uses descriptive words like “Deadly Plague,” but it does not attack a subject with an insulting label to discredit it.

Repetition – Yes – The idea that the plague could “mutate and become untreatable” is repeated multiple times throughout the text. Example: “Deadly Plague Could MUTATE And Become Untreatable As It Spreads Globally”; “health officials are now warning the deadly bacteria could mutate and become untreatable”; “it’s a real worry that it mutates and become untreatable”

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as a slogan or rallying cry.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The article is constructed to create fear about the plague spreading and becoming more dangerous. Example: “Coupled with the high likelihood that this disease could spread globally by an infected traveler getting on a plane to Europe or America, health officials are now warning that the strain of plague which has already killed more than 140 Madagascar could mutate and become untreatable.”

Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or organization; in fact, it uses authorities to build its own credibility.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the immediate threat of the plague mutating and spreading globally. Example: The headline, “Deadly Plague Could MUTATE And Become Untreatable As It Spreads Globally,” presents a remote possibility as a likely, imminent event.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its case.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to provoke a reaction from the reader. Example: “Deadly Plague,” “worst outbreak,” “devastated Europe’s population,” “black death.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to hated groups like the Nazis to discredit an idea.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not attribute the complex outbreak to a single, simple cause. It even notes that one tradition was only “partially blamed” for the spread.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its messaging, not intentionally vague or confusing.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text relies on the statements of experts and organizations to support its claims. Example: “Professor Paul Hunter has warned that, while it would be rather easy for an advanced country to contain the disease in its current form, he fears that it could evolve into something far more dangerous.”

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present only two choices or options to the reader.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any clichés to shut down critical thought.

Red herring – No – All the information presented in the text is relevant to the central topic of the plague outbreak.

Straw men – No – The text does not create and then refute a false argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it is based on a real news event and cites real authorities, its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader through emotion, specifically fear. It heavily employs techniques like Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language, Exaggeration, and Repetition to create a sense of imminent and catastrophic danger. The headline sensationalizes a remote possibility, and the repeated warnings about the plague becoming "untreatable" are designed to maximize alarm. This style of reporting, often called "scaremongering," manipulates facts and expert opinions to generate a strong emotional response and is a clear form of propaganda.
