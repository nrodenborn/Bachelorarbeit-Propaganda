Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and black & white fallacy. These elements suggest a strong likelihood of propaganda, as the text aims to influence the reader's perception of sanctuary cities and immigration enforcement by using emotionally charged language and oversimplified arguments. However, not all techniques are present, and some arguments are based on factual events, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood.
