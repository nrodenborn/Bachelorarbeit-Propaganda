Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly refers to the Mueller investigation as the "Mueller circus," which is an insulting label designed to frame it as a spectacle devoid of seriousness or legitimacy.

Repetition – Yes – The phrase "Mueller circus" is repeated in the title and the first line, reinforcing the central, derogatory message about the investigation.

Slogans – Yes – The title itself, "The Mueller Circus is Over, Long Live the Mueller Circus," functions as a memorable, slogan-like phrase that encapsulates the article's cynical viewpoint.

Appeal to fear – No – The text describes a negative situation and attributes malicious motives to a group ("the swamp"), but it does not explicitly instill fear against a specific alternative course of action for the reader.

Doubt – Yes – The text is designed to cast doubt on the entire Mueller investigation and the media, for example, by stating the report contains "inevitable lies, smears and assaults from the Obama/Clinton team".

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text makes the unsubstantiated and likely exaggerated claim that the media made "ten times that more" than the millions the investigation cost taxpayers, and that the fortunes made were "priceless."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use appeals to patriotism, national pride, or patriotic symbols to make its case.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words intended to evoke a negative reaction, such as "circus," "lies," "smears," "assaults," "coup members," "swamp," "malice," and "spite."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or group to the Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular and that the reader should therefore adopt it. In fact, it frames its position as being in opposition to a powerful majority ("the swamp," "the media").

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex motivations and events behind the Mueller investigation and subsequent actions to "three goals" that are "simple," such as "Keep the media happy and profitable" and "Punish the voting public for electing Trump."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and aggressive in its claims. While terms like "the swamp" are broad, they are used to make a clear point to the intended audience, not to intentionally confuse through obscurity.

Appeal to authority – No – The text does not cite any experts, officials, or other authorities to support its claims.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a binary opposition: "The more Trump is investigated, the less he can investigate, reform or implement changes to the swamp." This frames the situation as having only two outcomes, ignoring any other possibilities or nuances.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like "Never underestimate the power of the swamp's spite" and "Culture wars are built on tribal rage" as definitive statements that discourage further questioning or complex discussion.

Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its primary topic of attacking the Mueller investigation and its aftermath, without introducing irrelevant material to distract the reader.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that was not the official purpose of the investigation. It claims the investigation's goals are to make the media profitable and punish voters, and then attacks these manufactured motivations, rather than addressing the investigation's stated purpose of examining Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Whataboutism – No – The text attacks opponents but does not do so by deflecting criticism of its own side by pointing out the hypocrisy of others.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It does not attempt to present a balanced or evidence-based analysis of the Mueller report. Instead, it employs a wide array of propaganda techniques to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint. The piece relies heavily on emotional manipulation through Name-calling ("Mueller circus"), Loaded Language ("lies," "smears," "coup members"), and Causal Oversimplification (reducing the investigation to three simple, malicious goals). It creates a stark Black & white fallacy of Trump versus "the swamp" and uses Straw men arguments to misrepresent and attack the motivations of the investigators and the media. The clear intent is not to inform but to inflame and solidify an "us vs. them" narrative, which is a primary function of propaganda.
