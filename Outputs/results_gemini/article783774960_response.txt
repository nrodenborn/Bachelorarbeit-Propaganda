Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels like “Muslim jihadis,” “Islamists,” and “little jihadis” to attack the subjects of the article.
Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is repeated three times. Additionally, the district attorney's failure to file within 10 days is mentioned multiple times.
Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by stating that children at the compound were “being trained to commit jihad in mass school shootings,” linking the subjects to a widely feared event to support the author's viewpoint.
Doubt – Yes – The text explicitly questions the credibility of multiple entities, stating, “Yeah, well, that's about as trustworthy as the FBI in this matter,” and suggesting the FBI might be engaged in a “coverup” and has its “own complicity.”
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author minimizes the new federal charges by exclaiming, “And the death of the three-year-old? Nothing! And what of the training of little jihadis? Nothing!” This exaggerates the idea that the most serious crimes are being ignored, despite the text later stating the DA will seek grand jury indictments for the death.
Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by invoking the U.S. Constitution in its criticism of the President: “According to the Constitution, you, and you alone, are the sole head of the executive branch…”
Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases designed to appeal to emotions and stereotypes, such as “Jihad compound,” “terror compound,” and “Islamists.”
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with hated groups like Nazis to discredit it.
Bandwagon – No – The text does not attempt to persuade the reader by claiming an idea is popular or that “everyone” is doing it.
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple cause for a complex legal event by stating, “this all occurred because the district attorney failed to file for a preliminary hearing within 10 days and didn’t even bother to show up for court,” ignoring other potential legal complexities.
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The author uses vague expressions to create suspicion without providing evidence, such as speculating about the FBI’s “own complicity” and “what really took place at that compound.”
Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites external sources like “CBN reports” and official statements from the “U.S. Attorney's Office” to support its claims. It also appeals to the Constitution as an ultimate authority.
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by framing the situation as a choice between true “justice” and a “coverup,” and by suggesting an attorney general is either “serious about justice” or engaged in “political grandstanding or covering up criminal activity,” with no other possibilities.
Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “you are where the buck stop” is a cliché used to end discussion about responsibility by assigning it to a single person.
Red herring – Yes – The poll, “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?”, is completely irrelevant to the events in New Mexico and serves to distract the reader.
Straw men – No – The text criticizes the actions and statements of officials directly rather than misrepresenting their arguments and refuting a position they did not take.
Whataboutism – Yes – When discussing the current case, the author deflects by bringing up past, unrelated failures of the FBI, stating, “…don't forget that the FBI ignore the intelligence that was provided to them, just like they have in many cases…”

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast majority (15 out of 18) of the listed techniques to construct a narrative that is not intended to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly emotional, and conspiratorial viewpoint. The article moves far beyond reporting facts and instead uses loaded language (“jihadis,” “terror compound”), name-calling, and appeals to fear (“mass school shootings”) to demonize the subjects. It actively works to erode trust in institutions like the district attorney's office and the FBI by casting doubt on their competence and motives, suggesting a “coverup” and “complicity” without evidence (obfuscation). The use of a completely irrelevant poll (red herring) and the oversimplification of complex legal matters further underscore its goal of manipulation over information. An objective news report would present the facts of the arrests and legal proceedings using neutral language, whereas this text is a masterclass in using propaganda to frame an event to fit a pre-determined, outrage-driven narrative.
