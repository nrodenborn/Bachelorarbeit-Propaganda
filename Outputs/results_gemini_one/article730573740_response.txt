Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Cardinal Müller calling the blessing of a homosexual couple an “atrocity” and the Church's adaptation to the modern world a “suicidal modernization.” These are strong, insulting labels.
Repetition – Yes – The core message that Church teaching is absolute and must be interpreted in continuity with past magisterium (specifically Veritatis Splendor) is repeated by multiple sources in the article: Cardinal Müller, Archbishop Zvolensy, and Professor Livio Melina.
Slogans – Yes – The headline “Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’” functions as a brief, memorable, and impactful phrase that summarizes the article's core message.
Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that modernizing trends are a “suicidal modernization” and that contradictory interpretations of doctrine lead to “chaotic conditions” and a “situation like the one before the Reformation,” instilling fear of schism and chaos.
Doubt – Yes – The article casts doubt on the credibility of alternative interpretations of Amoris Laetitia by some bishops’ conferences, stating they lead to “chaotic conditions” and that in dogmatic questions, “there cannot be a plurality.” This questions the authority and theological soundness of those conferences.
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by quoting Müller, who calls the blessing of a homosexual couple an “atrocity” (an extremely wicked act) and compares the current disagreements to the “situation like the one before the Reformation.”
Flag-Waving – Yes – While not appealing to a nation, the text appeals to a shared Catholic identity by framing the issue as a defense of the authentic “Magisterium of the Church” and “the Truth of God” against modernizing forces.
Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “atrocity,” “decried,” “suicidal modernization,” and “chaotic conditions” to evoke a strong emotional response from the reader.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text uses a variation of this technique. Instead of Hitler, it disapproves of modern trends by associating them with Martin Luther and the Reformation (“a situation like the one before the Reformation”), a profoundly negative event for the intended Catholic audience.
Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is good because it is popular. In fact, it frames Cardinal Müller’s position as standing against a popularizing modern trend.
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests that “contradictory conceptions concerning the Sacraments, said the cardinal, lead into chaotic conditions.” This presents a simple cause for a highly complex situation of theological and pastoral disagreement within the global Church.
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague. Its arguments and condemnations are presented directly and clearly.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The article’s entire argument is built on the authority of its speakers: Cardinal Müller (“former Vatican doctrine chief”), Archbishop Zvolensy (“President of the Slovakian Bishops’ Conference”), and Professor Livio Melina (“former President of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute”). It also appeals to the authority of the encyclical Veritatis Splendor and “Christ Himself.”
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: the “orthodox way” of interpreting Church teaching, or the path of “suicidal modernization” and “chaotic conditions.” Müller’s statement that “In dogmatic questions, there cannot be a plurality” explicitly rejects any middle ground or nuanced positions.
Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like “The Commandments are an expression of the Love of God for us” and the assertion that Amoris Laetitia must be understood such that “he who lives in the state of mortal sin cannot receive Holy Communion” are presented as definitive, unchallengeable truths that shut down further nuanced discussion.
Red herring – Yes – The specific criticism of “Martin Luther's own denial of man's free will and his teaching about the total depravity of man” is a red herring. It diverts the discussion from the contemporary Catholic debate about Amoris Laetitia to a 500-year-old theological dispute with Protestantism.
Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a distorted version of its opponents' argument by characterizing the modernizing trend as a desire for a “submissive change of the Church into a NGO for the embetterment of the this-worldly life conditions.” Proponents of these changes would not frame their own arguments this way.
Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge its opponents with hypocrisy. It attacks their theological and pastoral positions directly rather than deflecting with a counter-accusation.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a neutral news report on an event but a curated piece designed to advance a specific theological and ideological viewpoint while discrediting any opposition. The article, published by LifeSiteNews (an outlet known for its strong conservative Catholic stance), exclusively presents voices that support one side of an internal Church debate. It systematically employs a wide array of propaganda techniques to frame this side as heroic, orthodox, and authoritative, while portraying the opposing view as chaotic, destructive, and unfaithful.

The piece relies heavily on emotional manipulation through Loaded Language ("atrocity," "suicidal"), Name Calling, and Appeal to Fear (warning of chaos and a new Reformation). It builds its case on a one-sided Appeal to Authority, stacking credentialed figures who all agree with each other, while presenting the opposition's argument as a Straw Man (reducing it to turning the Church into an "NGO"). It uses logical fallacies like the Black & White Fallacy to eliminate any possibility of a nuanced or middle-ground position.

A neutral journalistic article would have sought comment from the figures being criticized (like Cardinal Marx), provided more background on their actual proposals rather than just condemning them, and used more dispassionate language. This text does the opposite; its purpose is not to inform but to persuade and reinforce the beliefs of its target audience by presenting a narrative of crisis that has clear heroes and villains. The sheer density of the techniques used confirms its nature as propaganda.
