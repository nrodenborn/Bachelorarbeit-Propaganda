Here's the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Barack Obama's reckless appeasement", "disastrous nuclear deal", "milquetoast approach". These are insulting labels applied to Obama's actions.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – While themes like Iran's threat and Obama's failures recur, the *exact same message* isn't repeated verbatim extensively enough.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, brief, memorable phrases designed solely for easy recall are prominent ("Shiite Crescent" is descriptive, not a slogan in this context).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text repeatedly emphasizes the threat Iran poses: "hegemonic threat", "threat to international peace", "aggression", "fund its aggression", "establish its Shiite Crescent", "sophisticated rockets... for future use against Israeli population centers", "new monster", "cycle of violence", "perpetuate conflict". It uses this fear to justify actions against Iran and critique past policies.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Whether the Trump administration follows through remains to be seen." casts doubt on the Trump administration's commitment. "apparently have done next to nothing" casts doubt on coalition efforts.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – **Exaggeration:** Portraying Iran as the sole cause of complex events (ISIS re-emergence, Syria conflict) via Obama's actions. Describing Iraq as a "virtual vassal state". Labeling Hezbollah as having "American blood on its hands" without specifics. **Minimization:** Downplaying the complexity of the Syrian conflict and the roles of other actors. Minimizing the stated goals/constraints of the Obama administration's policies.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While Israeli actions are described ("Israel will do what is necessary"), the text doesn't overtly appeal to the reader's patriotism or identity as a primary technique. Focus is on threats and policy critiques.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Pervasive use of emotionally charged negative words: "reckless appeasement", "disastrous", "radical Shiite Iranian regime", "purported", "vassal state", "largest state sponsor of terrorism", "aggression", "coffers", "new monster", "terrorist proxy", "sophisticated rockets", "blood on its hands", "bought and paid for", "expansionist", "free reign", "cycle of violence", "fallout", "ambitions".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – "largest state sponsor of terrorism" is used to immediately discredit Iran and any actions attributed to it (like "rescuing" Iraq/Syria). Linking Hezbollah to "American blood on its hands" serves a similar guilt-by-terrorist-association purpose.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Popularity of the idea (opposing Iran) isn't invoked as a reason to support it. Focus is on threat and policy failure.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames Obama's troop withdrawal *directly* for ISIS's re-emergence: "Obama precipitously removed... giving rise to ISIS’s re-emergence". Blames Obama's policies *directly* for enabling Iran's rise and influence: "Obama ran down our options...", "Obama's disastrous nuclear deal... legitimized... filling its coffers...".
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and accusatory, not deliberately obscure or vague. Terms like "Shiite Crescent" are explained contextually.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Quotes are used from "an Iraqi Kurdish official," Andrew Tabler (senior fellow), Jonathan Spyer, and H.R. McMaster to lend credibility to the narrative of Iran's threat and policy failures.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the Obama administration's approach as weak and disastrous ("appeasement", "milquetoast") solely versus the Trump administration's approach as strong and correct ("sharp denunciation", "welcome departure", "proclaimed its intention"), ignoring nuance or other policy options/contexts.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No obvious phrases used to shut down discussion (e.g., "it is what it is", "America First" isn't used here). The loaded language is argumentative but not inherently thought-terminating.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on Iran's threat, Obama's policies, and Israel's response. No significant irrelevant distractions are introduced.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks actual policies (Iran deal, troop withdrawal) and stated Iranian actions/goals. It doesn't misrepresent an opponent's argument to refute it.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not accuse its opponents (Obama, coalition) of hypocrisy by pointing to their other actions. It critiques specific policies and inaction directly.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It employs numerous propaganda techniques systematically:
*   It relies heavily on **Loaded Language** and **Appeal to Fear** to create a sense of imminent danger from Iran and its allies.
*   It uses **Name Calling** and **Reduction ad Hitlerum** to demonize opponents (Obama administration, Iran) and dismiss their actions or motives.
*   It engages in **Causal Oversimplification**, blaming complex geopolitical outcomes (ISIS resurgence, Iranian influence) almost solely on specific actions of the Obama administration.
*   It employs the **Black & White Fallacy**, presenting the previous administration as entirely weak/wrong and the current one as strong/right regarding Iran.
*   It uses **Appeal to Authority** selectively through quotes that support its narrative.
*   While based on real events (airstrikes, troop withdrawals, the Iran deal), the presentation is highly selective, emotionally charged, and designed to persuade the reader to a specific viewpoint (Iran is an existential threat enabled by Obama, Israel/Trump are right to confront it) rather than provide a balanced analysis. The sheer density and combination of these techniques leave little room for objective reporting. The 5% allowance is for the factual basis of some events mentioned, though their framing is propagandistic.
