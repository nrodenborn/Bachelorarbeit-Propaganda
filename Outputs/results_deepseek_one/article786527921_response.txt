2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated emphasis on "silent donation" and "partisan intent" (e.g., "openly partisan intent," "partisan motives").  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "Silent Donation" (used as a memorable phrase to encapsulate the alleged misconduct).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings about tech companies "control[ling] and shutter[ing] conservative ideas" and influencing elections (e.g., "When will something be done about these tech and social media companies?").  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Google’s non-partisan claims (e.g., "undercut her own commentary ... by openly admitting").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates Google’s influence (e.g., "Google alone could determine the outcome of almost any election") and minimizes Murillo’s non-partisan statements as disingenuous.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to American electoral integrity (e.g., "interfere in elections in the United States in a partisan manner against the duly elected President").  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotional terms like "devastating," "afraid for our families," "vehemently offended," and "rogue staffer" stoke outrage.

10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on popular support for the article’s claims.

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct; no deliberate confusion.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites Tucker Carlson, Dr. Robert Epstein, and a "source close to the White House" to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Portrays Google as purely partisan (e.g., "this was not an exercise in civics, this was political consulting"), ignoring nuance.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "case closed" or "end of story" to halt debate.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Mentions the Mueller probe (e.g., "compared the revelations ... to Special Counsel Robert Mueller") to distract from the email’s content.

### Final Verdict  
**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits extensive use of propaganda techniques to advance a narrative of deliberate, partisan election interference by Google. Key indicators include:  
- **Selective framing**: Presents leaked emails as evidence of a conspiracy against conservatives, while downplaying Murillo’s stated non-partisan goals.  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded language (e.g., "devastating," "afraid for our families") and fear appeals paint Google as a threat to democracy.  
- **Bias amplification**: Uses exaggeration (e.g., Google’s power to "determine the outcome of almost any election") and causal oversimplification to blame Google for Clinton’s loss.  
- **Source slant**: Published by Breitbart (a partisan outlet), the article omits counter-evidence (e.g., Google’s protocols for non-partisan GOTV efforts) and relies on authority figures (Carlson, Epstein) to legitimize claims.  
- **Persuasive intent**: Techniques like name-calling ("leftist," "rogue staffer") and flag-waving aim to galvanize opposition to tech companies rather than inform neutrally.  
While based on real emails, the text’s structure, language, and omissions transform factual reporting into propaganda, leaving only minor room for non-propagandistic elements (e.g., direct quotes from the email).
