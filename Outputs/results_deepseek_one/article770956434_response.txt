### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels directed at opponents (e.g., no terms like "traitors" or "criminals" for prosecutors).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" repeats three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., no equivalents to "Build the Wall").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No attempts to instill fear about alternatives (e.g., no warnings of future injustices if Trump hadn’t acted).  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility (e.g., no "Can we trust the courts?").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes the Hammonds’ responsibility: "a fire that leaked onto a small portion of public land" downplays the arson. Calls the appeal "overzealous" to minimize government actions.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeals to patriotism (e.g., no "true Americans support this").  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms like "unjust," "overzealous," "shock the conscience," "tyrants," and "devoted family men" frame the narrative.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or hated groups (e.g., "tyrants" is generic, not linked to Hitler/Nazis).  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "Widespread support from neighbors, law enforcement, and ranchers" implies readers should join popular opinion.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames the "previous administration" for the Hammonds’ sentencing, ignoring complex legal procedures.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – No vague or confusing language; arguments are straightforward.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites the judge’s original sentencing notes to legitimize the claim that the punishment was disproportionate.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Portrays the Hammonds as entirely innocent ("deserving of clemency") versus the government as unjust ("tyrants"), ignoring nuance.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "This was unjust" and "Justice is overdue" shut down critical analysis of the legal details.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The Brett Kavanaugh poll distracts from the Hammonds’ story and serves no relevance to the pardon.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments (e.g., no "Critics want ranchers in prison forever").  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no "What about Obama’s pardons?").  

### Verdict – 80% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of persuasive techniques to shape perception, rather than neutral reporting. Key indicators include:  
- **Loaded language** ("tyrants," "overzealous," "unjust") and **minimization** of the Hammonds’ crimes to evoke sympathy.  
- **Bandwagon appeals** and **black-and-white framing** paint the Hammonds as universally revered victims and the government as monolithic oppressors.  
- **Thought-terminating clichés** ("This was unjust") discourage scrutiny of legal complexities.  
- **Causal oversimplification** reduces the legal saga to blame on the "previous administration."  
- **Red herring** (Kavanaugh poll) diverts attention.  
While based on real events, the text omits counterpoints (e.g., details of the arson’s risks, why prosecutors appealed) and uses emotional manipulation to champion Trump’s action as heroic. The source (The Washington Standard, a partisan outlet) and call to "celebrate" further signal ideological advocacy. However, the absence of techniques like *fear-mongering* or *name-calling* prevents a 100% rating.
