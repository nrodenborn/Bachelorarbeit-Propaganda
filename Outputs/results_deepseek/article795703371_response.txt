### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text  
**Note:** The analysis focuses on the text's content (including Trump's tweets and the author's commentary).  

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Example: "CRIMINALS" (used by Trump to label migrants).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Example: The poll question "Will the Democrats try to impeach President Trump now that they control the House?" is repeated verbatim three times.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – Example: "All Democrats fault for weak laws!" (brief, memorable phrase blaming Democrats).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Example: "assault on our country," "Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in" (instills fear about migrants and border security).  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Example: "Why are you not stopping those payments now, Mr. President? They are unconstitutional..." (questions credibility of aid payments).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Example: "every single migrant... will more than likely commit at least 28 crimes" (exaggerates criminality of migrants).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Example: "CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!" (appeals to patriotism/national identity).  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Example: "onslaught," "assault" (emotionally charged terms dehumanizing migrants).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No emphasis on the popularity of an idea.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Example: Blaming "weak laws" (by Democrats) for complex migration issues ignores root causes like violence/poverty.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Example: "Criminal elements" (vague, unspecific about who/what is criminal).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Example: "as President, [this] is far more important to me" (uses presidential authority to validate claims).  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Example: Presents only two options: close the border via military or face an "assault" (ignores policy alternatives).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Example: "All Democrats fault for weak laws!" (shuts down deeper analysis of migration causes).  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Example: The impeachment poll distracts from the caravan topic.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – No misrepresentation of an opponent’s argument.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy.

### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Concentration of Techniques**: It employs 13/18 propaganda techniques (e.g., fear-mongering, name-calling, exaggeration), indicating a systematic effort to manipulate perception.  
2. **Dehumanizing Language**: Migrants are labeled "CRIMINALS" and an "onslaught," stripping them of humanity to justify extreme measures (military deployment, border closure).  
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded terms ("assault," "pouring in") and appeals to fear/patriotism override rational debate about migration policy.  
4. **Distraction & Oversimplification**: The impeachment poll (red herring) and blame toward Democrats ("All Democrats fault") evade nuanced discussion of root causes (e.g., Central American violence, U.S. foreign policy).  
5. **Authority Bias**: Trump’s tweets dominate the text, leveraging his presidential platform to lend false credibility to unverified claims (e.g., "DRUGS pouring in").  
6. **Purposeful Repetition**: Repeating the impeachment poll reinforces a partisan narrative unrelated to the caravan, priming readers to view Democrats as adversaries.  

**Why not 100%?**  
The text includes limited factual reporting (e.g., citing Reuters about the caravan’s growth) and criticizes Trump’s threats (e.g., calling payments "unconstitutional"). However, these elements are overshadowed by the overwhelming use of propagandistic framing, selective emphasis on Trump’s messaging, and the author’s own hyperbolic claims (e.g., "28 crimes"). Thus, it functions primarily as propaganda advancing a nativist, anti-immigrant agenda.
