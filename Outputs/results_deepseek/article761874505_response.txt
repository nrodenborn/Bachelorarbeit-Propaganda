Here is the analysis of the propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation*: The text does not use insulting labels to attack subjects (e.g., Obama/Clinton are criticized but not labeled with epithets like "traitor" or "criminal").  
2. **Repetition** – No  
   *Explanation*: The core message (unequal prosecution) is reiterated, but not excessively or formulaically.  
3. **Slogans** – No  
   *Explanation*: No brief, memorable phrases are used (e.g., no equivalents to "Make America Great Again").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
   *Explanation*: The text critiques past actions but does not instill fear about future alternatives.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: Saucier questions the credibility of prosecutors: "his prosecution was politically motivated" and "They used me as an example because of Hillary Clinton."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: Exaggeration: "The government actively destroyed his life." Minimization: Describing Clinton’s actions as "running around free" while downplaying the scale/nature of her case.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No  
   *Explanation*: No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: Emotional/stereotypical phrasing: "destroyed his life," "ruined for political reasons," "running around free," and "burnt about."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *Explanation*: No attempt to link opponents to universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No  
    *Explanation*: No emphasis on the popularity of Saucier’s claims.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes  
    *Explanation*: Attributes Saucier’s prosecution solely to the Clinton email scandal: "They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton," ignoring other legal factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No  
    *Explanation*: The text is direct; no unclear expressions are used to confuse.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No  
    *Explanation*: No authoritative figures or institutions are cited to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes  
    *Explanation*: Presents only two options: harsh punishment for Saucier vs. no consequences for Clinton ("Hillary is still walking free"), ignoring nuances (e.g., differences in intent, evidence, or legal contexts).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No  
    *Explanation*: No phrases that shut down critical discussion (e.g., "end of story").  
16. **Red herring** – No  
    *Explanation*: Focus remains on unequal treatment; no irrelevant distractions are introduced.  
17. **Straw men** – No  
    *Explanation*: The text refutes actual arguments (Clinton’s lack of prosecution) rather than misrepresenting them.  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes  
    *Explanation*: Charges opponents with hypocrisy by pivoting to Clinton’s actions: "They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal, but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton."

**Verdict – 85% –**  
The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements. It employs *loaded language*, *exaggeration*, and *doubt* to frame Saucier as a victim of political bias while vilifying Clinton/Obama officials. The core argument relies on *whataboutism* (Clinton’s emails) and *causal oversimplification* (attributing Saucier’s prosecution solely to the Clinton scandal). The *black-and-white fallacy* paints justice as hypocritical without addressing legal distinctions between the cases (e.g., Saucier admitted to destroying evidence; Clinton’s case involved no intent proven). Though it reports Saucier’s perspective, the narrative is one-sided, emotionally charged, and aligns with a broader partisan agenda (e.g., "Fox News" sourcing, emphasis on "unequal protection"). However, it is not 100% propaganda as it includes factual details (e.g., Saucier’s guilty plea, prison term). The overwhelming use of selective framing and manipulative techniques suggests a high likelihood of propaganda aimed at fueling distrust in institutions and political opponents.
