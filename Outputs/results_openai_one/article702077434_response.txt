**Verdict – 20% –** The article is primarily factual and reports on the conviction of Mohamad Khweis, using quotes from both the defense and prosecution. However, it does employ some propaganda techniques, such as doubt (questioning the cause of radicalization), causal oversimplification (suggesting radicalization happened without clear cause), obfuscation (repeatedly stating the cause is unknown), and appeal to authority (quoting officials to support the narrative). These techniques are subtle and do not dominate the article, which is largely informative. Therefore, there is a low likelihood (20%) that the text is propaganda, as it mostly presents facts but includes some elements that could influence perception through vagueness and appeals to authority.
