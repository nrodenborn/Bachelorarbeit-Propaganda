Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "WITCH HUNT" (used by Trump and his campaign to label the Mueller investigation).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No significant repetition of phrases or ideas beyond standard reporting.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "WITCH HUNT" (used as a memorable, rallying phrase in the campaign text and Trump’s quotes).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No attempt to instill fear about alternatives; focuses on reporting events.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Let’s see whether or not it’s legit" (Trump questioning the report’s credibility).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text reports statements neutrally (e.g., "illegal" investigation is attributed to Trump, not asserted by the author).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "WITCH HUNT" (emotionally charged term framing the investigation as malicious).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified causes for complex events.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Language is clear and specific (e.g., details about Trump’s calls, timelines).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No use of authoritative figures to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomies presented.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" to halt discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions; stays focused on the Mueller report.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no deflections like "but what about Hillary?").  

**Verdict – 30% –** The text itself is primarily factual journalism reporting on Trump’s actions and statements regarding the Mueller investigation. However, it quotes Trump and his campaign using propagandistic language (e.g., "WITCH HUNT" for Name Calling, Slogans, and Loaded Language). These elements are presented as attributed quotes rather than the author’s voice, and the article includes balancing context (e.g., noting Trump’s past attempt to fire Mueller). The core structure is informational, not persuasive, but reproduces propaganda from its subjects, resulting in a low likelihood of the text itself being propaganda.
