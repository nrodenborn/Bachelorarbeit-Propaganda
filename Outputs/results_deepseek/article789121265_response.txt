Here's the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Dicky Durban [sic], are a complete FRAUD" (insulting label directed at Sen. Durbin).
2. **Repetition** – **No** – The poll question ("Who should replace Nikki Haley...") is repeated 3 times, but this appears to be website formatting rather than propagandistic message repetition.
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans.
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Implied fear that Kavanaugh's confirmation without investigation would enable hypocrisy and injustice ("Where was mine?", "double standard").
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Repeatedly questions credibility of Democrats/Feinstein ("Not one Democrat would look at my deposition", "You didn't give a damn back then").
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Minimizes Ford's accusation as "flimsy and meritless" while emphasizing Broaddrick's as serious and ignored.
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "shut down", "liar", "didn't give a damn", "double standard", "FRAUD" (emotionally charged words).
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No association with hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to popularity of the idea.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Reduces complex political dynamics to simple hypocrisy about sexual assault allegations.
12. **Obfuscation** – **No** – Arguments are presented directly, not vaguely.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – No authoritative sources cited as evidence.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents Democrats as either investigating all allegations or none ("let's investigate my RAPE allegations too").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases used to shut down critical thought.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The comparison of cases is central to the argument, not irrelevant.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Refers to actual Democratic actions (ignoring Broaddrick's allegations).
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Core argument diverts from Kavanaugh/Ford by demanding equal attention for Broaddrick/Clinton ("Where was mine?", "let's investigate my RAPE allegations too").

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques including loaded language, whataboutism, name-calling, exaggeration/minimization, and black-and-white framing. It centers on a false equivalence between distinct historical cases while using emotionally charged accusations of hypocrisy to discredit political opponents. Though based on real events, its selective presentation, minimization of Ford's allegations, and inflammatory language ("FRAUD") serve a persuasive agenda rather than balanced analysis. The techniques aim to provoke outrage against Democrats rather than objectively examine either allegation.
