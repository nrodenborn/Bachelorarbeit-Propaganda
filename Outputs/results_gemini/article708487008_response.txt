Verdict – 20% – The text is very unlikely to be propaganda, though it employs a few techniques common to it. Its primary purpose is to inform the public about a health crisis by reporting on expert opinions and data from health organizations. The use of "Appeal to authority" is a standard journalistic practice of citing credible sources (a professor of infectious diseases, the WHO) and is not fallacious in this context. However, the headline "Black Death Warning" and the mention of how quickly the disease can kill are clear uses of "Loaded Language" and "Appeal to fear." These techniques are used to create a sensational headline to grab the reader's attention, a common practice in modern journalism, rather than to manipulate the audience for a political or ideological purpose. The body of the article is factual, data-driven, and sourced, which runs contrary to the aims of most propaganda.
