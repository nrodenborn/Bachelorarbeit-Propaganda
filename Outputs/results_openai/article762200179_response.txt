Verdict – 40% – The text contains elements of propaganda, such as doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, and appeal to authority, which suggest an attempt to influence the reader's perception of the Obama administration's actions regarding the Iran nuclear deal. However, it also presents responses from former Obama administration officials, which provides some balance to the narrative. The presence of these propaganda techniques indicates a moderate likelihood of the text being propaganda, but the inclusion of multiple perspectives reduces the overall likelihood.
