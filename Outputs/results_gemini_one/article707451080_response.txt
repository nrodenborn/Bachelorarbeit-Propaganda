1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack a group, referring to politicians as “corrupt career politicians that are completely and utterly out of control.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the idea that the current situation is unacceptable and action must be taken. For example, "The status quo is not acceptable in Washington," "The American people are not going to put up with this any longer," and "we simply are not going to put up with it anymore."
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the brief and memorable phrase “drain the swamp once and for all.”
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting a loss of national standing and a bleak future, stating, “We have no choice but to clean up our government because the rest of the world is laughing at us,” and ending with the line, “Take a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and integrity of the entire institution of Congress by asking, “If members of Congress are engaged in this type of behavior, why don’t the American people know about it? And why are those members of Congress still allowed to serve?”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the behavior of Joe Biden by quoting a source that describes it as “‘Weinstein-level’ predatory behavior.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a national disgrace that must be fixed to restore America's image, stating, “it is time to take our government back” and “We are supposed to serve as an example to the rest of the world, and instead, we have become a bad joke.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the audience, such as “deeply disturbing,” “truly disgusting,” “corrupt career politicians,” and “predatory behavior.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that there is a growing popular movement against the status quo, stating, “The American people are not going to put up with this any longer” and “we simply are not going to put up with it anymore.”
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests that the complex issue of systemic misconduct in Washington is caused simply by “corrupt career politicians” and that the solution is to “drain the swamp.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its accusations and uses specific figures and quotes to make its point, rather than being deliberately unclear.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites several authorities to support its claims, including “U.S. Representative Jackie Speier,” “Representative Barbara Comstock,” news outlets like “CNN” and “Breitbart,” and an “ex-Secret Service agent.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by suggesting there are only two options: “We have no choice but to clean up our government because the rest of the world is laughing at us.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase “drain the swamp,” which is a cliché that oversimplifies a complex political problem and discourages a more nuanced discussion about solutions.
16. Red herring – Yes – The article's main topic is sexual harassment in the House of Representatives, but it introduces an unrelated tangent about former Vice-President Joe Biden, who was part of the executive branch, to distract and broaden the attack.
17. Straw men – No – The text focuses on making accusations rather than refuting a counter-argument that was not presented.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge a specific opponent with hypocrisy in response to an accusation. The introduction of Joe Biden is more of a red herring than a direct whataboutism charge.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it uses factual elements, such as quotes from congressional hearings and news reports, its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade and incite a specific political action. This is evident from the author's stated goal to "get motivated to finally drain the swamp" and the declaration, "When I am elected to Congress, I am going to make fighting this sort of predatory behavior a top priority." The piece employs a vast number of propaganda techniques, including loaded language, name-calling, appeal to fear, flag-waving, and slogans, to create an emotionally charged narrative of widespread corruption. It simplifies a complex problem (Causal Oversimplification), presents a false binary choice (Black & White Fallacy), and introduces a red herring (the allegations against Joe Biden) to further its political argument. The framing, tone, and explicit call to action clearly mark it as a persuasive political piece rather than a neutral journalistic report.
