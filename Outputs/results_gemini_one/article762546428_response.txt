Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases that function as a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text aims to instill fear by highlighting "rampant violence," "liberal violence," "bullying," and "unsafe environments" in public schools to scare parents.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to make the reader doubt the safety, morality, and educational value of the public school system, stating "as schools continue to fail."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its case.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words such as "seethe," "brainwashing," "indoctrination," "collectivist agenda iceberg," and "absolute horror" to provoke an emotional response.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make a comparison to Hitler or the Nazis to discredit public schools.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text states that homeschooling rates are "skyrocketing" and that "so many have decided to educate their children themselves," appealing to the idea that this is a popular and growing trend that others should join.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents the rise in homeschooling as a direct result of a few simple factors ("liberal social engineering and violence") and claims the failure of state education is the cause for the destruction of the "moral fabric of humanity," which is a vast oversimplification.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague and menacing phrases like "leftist social engineering" and "the tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg" without clearly defining them, leaving them to the reader's negative imagination.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not rely on common, cliché phrases to end discussion.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces an irrelevant and lengthy tangent about the fundamental illegitimacy of all government ("Governments are nothing more than a handful of people and have no right to aggress against others") to distract from the core topic of education.

Straw men – Yes – The text creates a straw man by portraying public schools as being almost exclusively focused on "brainwashing and indoctrination," which is a distorted caricature that is easier to attack than the real, multifaceted institution.

Whataboutism – No – The text attacks its opponent directly and does not use the technique of deflecting criticism by charging the opponent with hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast majority of the listed techniques not to inform or persuade through balanced reasoning, but to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions. The piece is built on a foundation of fear appeals ("rampant violence"), loaded language ("brainwashing," "indoctrination," "seethe"), and exaggeration ("absolute horror"). It constructs a black & white fallacy, pitting the pure, safe option of homeschooling against a straw man caricature of public schools as dens of "leftist social engineering." It uses bandwagon appeals ("skyrocketing" rates) and appeals to hand-picked authorities to create a sense of an inevitable, correct movement. The goal is clearly not to present a nuanced discussion about educational choices but to stoke anger and fear to push a specific ideological agenda, making it a clear example of propaganda.
