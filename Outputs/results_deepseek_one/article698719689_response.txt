Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to any subject or object.
2.  **Repetition** – No – Key facts or phrases are not repeated excessively for emphasis.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to persuade.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the seriousness of the plague is described, the text reports facts (spread rate, fatality, transmission ease) without using them explicitly to instill fear *against alternatives* or drive a specific action beyond awareness. The tone is informative, not alarmist.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The credibility of any person, organization, or information is not questioned.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Figures (57 dead, 680 infected) and descriptions (e.g., "unprecedented rate", "more virulent") are presented as reported facts from sources (WHO, BNGRC, experts) without clear evidence of being inflated or downplayed for persuasive effect.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There are no appeals to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty (e.g., "our way of life").
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is largely factual and clinical (e.g., "claimed 57 lives", "infected", "bacterium Yersinia pestis", "symptoms include"). Terms like "black death" are used historically, not emotionally. "Unprecedented rate" and "huge concern" are descriptive based on context.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or other universally despised groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or action to encourage joining in.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The cause (bacteria, fleas, rats, transmission methods) and spread factors (urban settings, pneumonic form) are explained with appropriate complexity for a news report, not reduced to a single simplistic cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The information is presented clearly with specific figures, locations, disease types, transmission methods, and sources. Terms like "unprecedented" and "huge concern" are contextualized by the reported facts.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites WHO, BNGRC, CNN (reporting WHO/BNGRC), and "experts" to establish the credibility of the information (e.g., "According to CNN, the cases were reported by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Bureau for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC)"; "experts warn").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents the situation with its complexities (different plague types, locations, responses) and does not force a false dichotomy.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking or discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the plague outbreak, its details, and the response. No irrelevant topics are introduced.
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented arguments are presented to be refuted.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy are made against any person or group.

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is overwhelmingly a factual news report detailing an outbreak of plague in Madagascar. It presents specific data (cases, deaths, locations, types), explains the disease (cause, transmission, symptoms, forms), discusses why this outbreak is concerning compared to previous ones, and outlines the international response. While it cites authoritative sources like WHO and experts (Appeal to Authority), this is standard journalistic practice to establish credibility for factual reporting, not inherently propagandistic in this context. The language is primarily neutral and informative. The inherent seriousness of the plague outbreak may carry an inherent emotional weight, but the text itself does not appear to manipulate this to promote a specific agenda beyond informing the public. The very low percentage reflects the minor use of Appeal to Authority within an otherwise objective report.
