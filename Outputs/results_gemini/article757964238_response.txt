1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the federal justice system as a "prison for profit system" and includes a poll asking the reader to identify the "most corrupt Democrat Politician."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases that function as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text mentions "unmitigated 'terrorism' charges," which instills fear that the government can apply extreme labels and punishments to ordinary citizens for lesser offenses.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on the justice system by calling the verdict a "manifest miscarriage of justice" and a "gross miscarriage of justice."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the crime of arson on federal land by describing it as simply "doing what ranchers do," while potentially exaggerating the government's motive by calling it a "prison for profit system" and labeling the death of LaVoy Finicum a "murder."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the identity of "hard-working, family ranchers" and "Rural communities of the West" to create a sense of patriotism and shared identity among the target audience.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "murder," "miscarriage of justice," "humble ranchers," and "corrupt" to appeal to the reader's emotions and stereotypes.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to the Nazis or any other universally hated group.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text states, "many who have seen what took place... are calling on President Donald Trump" and "Many of you followed these stories," encouraging the reader to join a supposedly popular movement.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex legal case against the Hammonds to them simply "doing what ranchers do," ignoring the specific details of the federal arson charges for which they were convicted.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is quite direct in its accusations and its call to action; it does not use vague language to confuse the reader.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the "White House petition on behalf of Dwight and Steven Hammond by Protect The Harvest" to lend authority and credibility to its claims of injustice.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a simple choice between supporting "humble ranchers" and siding with a corrupt federal "prison for profit system," leaving no room for a nuanced view.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "doing what ranchers do" is used to frame the ranchers' actions as normal and unquestionable, discouraging any critical thought about the actual crime of arson.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about "corrupt Democrat Politician[s]" is completely irrelevant to the Hammond ranchers' case and serves only to distract the reader and channel their anger towards a separate political target.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text argues that the Hammonds "are the furthest thing from terrorists." This refutes an extreme interpretation of the charges (which fell under an anti-terrorism statute) rather than addressing the specific legal arguments for their conviction on arson charges.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not directly charge an opponent with hypocrisy using a "what about..." structure, though the red herring serves a similar distracting purpose.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint and take a specific action (signing a petition) by using emotional manipulation rather than balanced, factual reporting. The piece employs a vast array of propaganda techniques, including loaded language ("murder," "miscarriage of justice"), causal oversimplification ("doing what ranchers do"), and a stark black & white fallacy (innocent ranchers vs. a corrupt government). It creates an "in-group" of rural Americans and patriots (flag-waving) and an "out-group" of the federal government and Democrats, reinforced by the blatant red herring of a poll about "corrupt" politicians. The sheer number of techniques used in concert demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion and bypass critical thinking.
