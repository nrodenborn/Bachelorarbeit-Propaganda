Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by a verdict:

### Propaganda Technique Analysis
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "presstitutes" (used repeatedly to insult media), "idiot Russian Atlanticist Integrationists," "the whores who constitute the American print and TV media."  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "Russiagate" (repeated 10+ times), "military/security complex" (repeated 8+ times), "presstitutes" (repeated 4 times).  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "Russiagate is an orchestration," "The Russia Hoax," "Death of a Nation."  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "nuclear war would be a terminable event," "the danger of nuclear war is today far higher," "Russia will be destroyed," "end of life on earth."  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Mueller’s investigation... has nothing to do with Russiagate," "no evidence of something that did not happen," "deception of the FISA Court."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "largest concentration camp ever" (Gaza), military/security complex "large enough to be a member of the G-20." Minimization: Manafort’s crimes dismissed as "phony and meaningless."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "endorsement of the American people who... elected Donald Trump," framing Trump as defending democracy against a conspiracy.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "orchestration," "conspiracy," "frameup," "mass murder," "whipped up," "corrupt person," "idiots."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No direct comparison to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "The entire world looks at America and Israel... distrusted and universally hated."  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes all geopolitical tension to the "military/security complex" resisting normalized Russia relations.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – "military/security complex" (undefined entity), "orchestration" (vague process).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Quotes Alan Dershowitz to validate the "perjury trap" claim.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents Russiagate as purely a conspiracy with no valid basis; normalizing Russia relations vs. destruction.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Period." (to end debate on US-Russia relations), "It is the response of the military/security complex" (shuts down alternate explanations).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Detailed diversion into Gaza/Israel conflict unrelated to Russiagate.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Portrays Russiagate investigators as solely motivated by hatred of Trump, ignoring actual legal premises.  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Defends Manafort by citing banks’ mortgage fraud: "one of the causes of the mortgage-backed derivative crisis was the misrepresentation... by the companies."

### Verdict  
**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs 16/18 techniques, primarily through **emotionally charged language** ("presstitutes," "conspiracy," "mass murder"), **fear-mongering** (nuclear war, end of life), and **systematic delegitimization** of opponents (media, investigators, Democrats). It presents a **one-sided narrative** where Russiagate is an orchestrated coup by a shadowy "military/security complex," dismissing all counter-evidence. While it references factual events (e.g., Crimea, Manafort’s trial), these are selectively framed to support the core agenda: defending Trump and condemning US foreign policy. The lack of sourcing, hyperbolic claims (e.g., Gaza as "largest concentration camp"), and reliance on **conspiratorial logic** further confirm its propagandistic nature. The 5% uncertainty reflects isolated factual anchors (e.g., Mueller’s mandate), but these are instrumentalized to serve the polemical goal.
