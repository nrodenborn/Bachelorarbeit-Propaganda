Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – While "Muslims" and names of individuals are used, there are no specific insulting labels applied directly to them within the quoted text. Terms like "brainwash" describe alleged actions, not direct name-calling labels.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – The phrase "Political correctness needs to be thrown out the window" acts as a brief, memorable phrase advocating a specific action.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text strongly implies a widespread, ongoing threat ("at least 22 verified Islamic jihadi camps have existed on American soil... including one in the very country I reside in within eyeshot of a nuclear power plant") to instill fear and support the idea that political correctness is dangerous.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The rhetorical questions "Well, all of this should make Americans feel just comfy, right? I mean, after all, Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah is out of office so these things aren't really going on in America, right?" actively question the safety of America and the effectiveness/awareness of authorities ("under the watchful, or maybe not so watchful, eye of the FBI").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes (Exaggeration) – The claim of "at least 22 verified Islamic jihadi camps" existing on US soil for decades is a broad, alarming assertion presented without evidence or context, likely exaggerating the scale and nature of the threat.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – The text appeals to American identity and safety concerns ("all of this should make Americans feel just comfy, right?", the implied threat to "American soil", the mention of a nuclear power plant).
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Numerous emotionally charged words and phrases are used: "brainwash", "third world conditions", "Islamic jihadi camps", "devout, not radical, followers of Muhammad" (implying devoutness is linked to extremism), "take the Quran's teachings seriously" (in a threatening context).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt is made to link the subjects or ideas to Hitler or Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not primarily argue that an idea is correct because it's popular.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – It strongly implies that "political correctness" is the simple cause preventing authorities from dealing with the alleged widespread threat of Islamic extremism within the US ("Political correctness needs to be thrown out the window when dealing with those...").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – While some claims lack evidence (e.g., "22 verified Islamic jihadi camps"), the language itself is not deliberately obscure or vague; the intended meaning and accusations are clear.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text repeatedly cites "documents", "court filing", "Taos County Sheriff's Department", "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution", and "The Associated Press" to lend credibility to its claims about the compound and the training allegations.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – It presents a dichotomy: either abandon political correctness to deal with the threat ("those who take the Quran's teachings seriously") or be unsafe ("these things" will keep happening). The complex issue of security, religious freedom, and civil liberties is reduced to this binary choice.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – While the slogan "Political correctness needs to be thrown out the window" could potentially stifle discussion, it's presented more as a call to action than a definitive phrase ending debate within this specific text. No clear examples like "it is what it is" are used to shut down thought.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The inclusion of the completely unrelated poll about Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation ("Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" repeated 3 times + poll options) distracts from the main story about the compound.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent an opposing argument to refute it. It focuses on its own narrative of threat and the need to abandon political correctness.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse critics or opponents of hypocrisy to deflect from the issues it raises.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits numerous propaganda techniques, heavily skewing towards propaganda. While reporting factual elements (arrests, discovery of a body, allegations from court documents via AJC/AP), the core narrative is constructed using:
*   **Repetition & Slogans:** To emphasize unrelated political content (Kavanaugh poll) and a core message (anti-political correctness).
*   **Appeal to Fear & Loaded Language:** To create a sense of pervasive, immediate threat from Islamic extremism within the US, linked to religious devotion itself ("devout, not radical, followers").
*   **Doubt:** Undermining trust in safety and authorities (FBI).
*   **Exaggeration:** Making an alarming, unsubstantiated claim about "22 verified Islamic jihadi camps".
*   **Causal Oversimplification & Black & White Fallacy:** Framing "political correctness" as the singular, dangerous obstacle to security, presenting a simplistic either/or choice.
*   **Appeal to Authority (Selectively):** Using official sources for the initial crime report while making broader, unsupported claims independently.
*   **Red Herring:** Introducing the irrelevant Kavanaugh poll.
The overall effect is not just to inform about a crime, but to promote a specific, fear-based worldview about Islam and advocate for the abandonment of political correctness as the necessary solution to an allegedly widespread domestic threat. The factual reporting serves as a springboard for this persuasive, agenda-driven narrative.
