1. Name calling – Yes – The text directly attacks former CIA Director Richard Helms with insulting labels to discredit his testimony. Example: "He left out that former CIA Director Richard Helms was a perjurer. A liar."
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the same descriptive words to characterize the alleged CIA plot, reinforcing the idea in the reader's mind. Example: The words "cunning," "ingenious," and "brilliant" are used multiple times to describe the cover-up, such as in "one of the most ingenious and cunning plots ever designed" and "The CIA’s cover-up in the JFK assassination was even more brilliant and ingenious."
3. Slogans – No – The text is a long-form article and does not employ brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text explains the motive for the cover-up by invoking the terrifying prospect of nuclear war, suggesting that this fear was used to shut down the investigation. Example: "An assassination of the president by the Soviet Union and Cuba is obviously an act of war. That means nuclear war is about to break out..."
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to cast doubt on the official narrative of the JFK assassination, primarily by asking rhetorical questions that imply a conspiracy. Example: "How often have you ever heard of a U.S. Marine communist? If Oswald was a genuine communist, why would he have joined the Marines in the 1950s...?"
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses hyperbole to describe the supposed CIA plot, making it seem more significant and well-designed than can be proven. Example: "Whatever else might be said about the assassination of President Kennedy, one thing is for sure: The cover-up of this particular U.S. regime-change operation was one of the most ingenious and cunning plots ever designed."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of populist identity by framing the issue as a conspiracy by a federal agency against the "American people." Example: "...records of the CIA and other federal agencies that had been kept secret from the American people since 1963."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses words with strong emotional connotations to influence the reader's perception of events and individuals. Example: "And employ Operation Mockingbird-like journalistic assets in the private sector to flood the market with alternative “conspiracy theories” to confound and confuse the public. And smear anyone who questions the official narrative..."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other universally hated groups to discredit an idea.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that its viewpoint is part of a larger, popular movement of public awakening, thereby encouraging the reader to join the crowd. Example: "The ARRB Had been formed after Americans had learned of the official secrecy after watching Oliver Stone’s movie JFK..."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the highly complex events surrounding the JFK assassination to a single, straightforward cause: a CIA plot designed to be covered up by the threat of nuclear war. Example: "That’s why they had shots fired from the front and placed Oswald in the rear. The idea was that since an investigation would lead to Oswald’s supposed communist confederates in the front, which in turn would lead to nuclear war, the investigation had to be shut down immediately..."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The author presents speculation and assumption as if it were a logical step in reasoning, blurring the line between evidence and conjecture. Example: "It would be safe to assume that the CIA continued developing and expanding on the assassination principles enunciated in that early assassination manual."
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites various sources, such as doctors and reporters, to lend credibility to the claims being made. Example: "The doctors at Parkland Hospital stated that President Kennedy had a big exit-sized wound in the back of his head, which implied a shot having been fired from the front."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the identity of Lee Harvey Oswald as a binary choice, ignoring other possibilities to force the author's conclusion. Example: The series of questions about Oswald's time as a Marine is designed to lead to the conclusion that since he couldn't be a "genuine communist," he must have been a U.S. intelligence agent.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author uses a definitive, simplistic statement to resolve a complex issue, discouraging further critical thought. Example: After a long series of rhetorical questions about Oswald, the author concludes with a simple, final declaration: "The answer: Helms lied."
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces detailed information about other CIA operations that, while establishing a pattern of behavior, are irrelevant to providing direct evidence for the central claim about the JFK assassination. Example: The lengthy sections on the CIA's "regime-change operation in Guatemala" serve to build animosity towards the CIA without proving its involvement in Kennedy's death.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author misrepresents an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. The author reframes journalist Ian Shapira's point about a transcript's public availability as a defense of Richard Helms's credibility. Example: "But Shapira would be wise to follow his own advice because he himself is guilty of what he accuses others of. That’s because he failed to conclude his article with one great big important point about former CIA Director Richard Helms... Perjury."
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The author deflects from the substance of an opponent's argument by accusing them of hypocrisy. Example: "But Shapira would be wise to follow his own advice because he himself is guilty of what he accuses others of."

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 16 of the 18 listed propaganda techniques in a systematic effort to persuade the reader of a specific conspiracy theory. Rather than presenting a balanced analysis of evidence, the author relies heavily on emotionally loaded language, casting doubt, attacking the character of opponents (Name Calling, Whataboutism), and using logical fallacies (Straw Men, Red Herring, Causal Oversimplification) to build a case. The argument is structured not to explore a topic objectively, but to lead the reader to a predetermined conclusion by manipulating their emotions and perceptions. The sheer density and variety of these techniques indicate that the primary purpose of the text is persuasion and indoctrination, not objective reporting or historical analysis.
