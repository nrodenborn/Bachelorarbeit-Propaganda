Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the given text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Democrat temper tantrums", "RINO Republican Senator Jeff Flake". These are insulting labels.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – While phrases like "political hit" are used, there isn't a distinct, memorable phrase used repetitively as a slogan within the core narrative.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Speculating the investigation could expand into a "circus" that "will dwarf anything Clarence Thomas had to face" instills fear about the potential negative consequences of the investigation.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "there has been zero evidence submitted to the committee that Ford's allegations are true" and characterizing the allegations as lacking credibility casts doubt on Dr. Ford and the Democrats' motives.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Minimization: Describing the allegations as having "zero evidence" and being based on "Senate Democrat temper tantrums" minimizes the seriousness of the accusations and the Democrats' position. Exaggeration: Calling it a "huge waste of time" and a potential "circus" exaggerates the negative aspects of the investigation.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No direct appeals to patriotism or national identity are made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Numerous examples: "temper tantrums", "smear of Kavanaugh", "slanderous accusations", "political hit", "circus". These words carry strong negative connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis or Hitler are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text doesn't primarily argue that the investigation is wrong *because* it's unpopular or that opposing it is popular.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – The text presents the FBI investigation as being ordered *solely* because of "Senate Democrat temper tantrums" and "RINO Republican Senator Jeff Flake's desire", ignoring other potential factors or the stated rationale (like further scrutiny of serious allegations).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is generally direct and opinionated, not deliberately vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – References to "sworn statements by those she claims were there", "Kavanaugh's calendar", "character statements by dozens of women", and statements from Mark Judge and Patrick Smyth are used as evidence to support Kavanaugh's innocence and discredit Ford.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – The prediction of the FBI outcome: "(1) Absolutely nothing will be found... or (2) look for this thing to expand...". This presents only two extreme, negative possibilities.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "this has been nothing but a political hit". This phrase shuts down further critical analysis by providing a simplistic, dismissive label for the entire event.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The inclusion of the poll about Nikki Haley's replacement ("take our poll - story continues below...") and its associated sign-up text is completely irrelevant to the Kavanaugh story and serves as a distraction.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – The text characterizes the Democrats' position as solely based on "temper tantrums" and a "smear" campaign driven by belief in Ford without evidence and obvious disbelief of Kavanaugh, potentially misrepresenting or oversimplifying their actual arguments for further investigation.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – While it references the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas situation for comparison, it doesn't directly charge the current critics with hypocrisy related to that past event.

**Verdict – 90% – Explanation:** The text exhibits a very high concentration of propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on **Name Calling** ("temper tantrums", "RINO", "smear"), **Loaded Language** ("slanderous", "circus", "political hit"), **Exaggeration/Minimization** ("zero evidence", "huge waste of time"), **Doubt**, and **Appeal to Authority** to discredit the opposition (Democrats, Dr. Ford) and downplay the allegations against Kavanaugh. It employs **Causal Oversimplification** regarding the investigation's origin and a **Black & White Fallacy** regarding its potential outcomes. It uses **Repetition** (the poll) and includes an irrelevant **Red Herring** (the poll and sign-up). It dismisses critical thought with a **Thought-Terminating Cliché** ("nothing but a political hit") and potentially misrepresents opponents' views via a **Straw Man**. The overall tone is highly partisan, emotionally charged, and aims to persuade the reader to a specific viewpoint by selectively presenting information and using manipulative language rather than offering a neutral, balanced account. The sheer number and intensity of these techniques make it overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda.
