1. Name calling – No – The text reports that Ellison was accused of "screaming obscenities," but the article itself does not use insulting labels to attack any subject.
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat the same message over and over for persuasive effect; it presents different statements and developments in the story.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear in the audience about alternative ideas or outcomes.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text raises doubt about the accuser's credibility by focusing on the lawyer's report. Example: "A draft report obtained by the AP noted Monahan's shifting rationale for refusing to produce the video footage, including that it was lost, was on a USB drive in storage and would be too embarrassing and traumatic to release it."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text reports on Ellison's attempt to minimize the allegations by changing the subject. Example: "At this time, I will be focusing on the issues of this important election."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to group identity, specifically political party affiliation, and the conflict within it. Example: "I've been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to describe the events and reactions. Example: "Monahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations..."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text reports on an observed bandwagon effect concerning another case ("Many prominent Democrats have supported Ford’s allegations") to create a contrast, but does not use the technique to persuade the reader to join a cause.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The lawyer's reported conclusion simplifies the basis for substantiating abuse to a single piece of evidence. Example: "...unable to substantiate the accusations of domestic abuse against Rep. Keith Ellison because the lawmaker’s ex-girlfriend refused to provide video of the incident..."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text quotes a statement that is deliberately vague to shift responsibility. Example: "...we have decided to forward the information in the investigation to local authorities in order to let them review the contents and determine whether further investigation is warranted."
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The entire premise of the article and its headline is based on the findings of an authority figure hired by the party. Example: "A lawyer hired by Minnesota Democrats says she is unable to substantiate the accusations of domestic abuse against Rep. Keith Ellison..."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The lawyer's conclusion implies a false binary that the claim can only be substantiated with the video, ignoring other forms of evidence. Example: The conclusion that the claim is unsubstantiated *because* the video was not provided presents the two options as the only possibilities.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text includes a quote from a politician using a common phrase to shut down further discussion on an uncomfortable topic. Example: "At this time, I will be focusing on the issues of this important election."
16. Red herring – Yes – The text quotes Ellison introducing an irrelevant topic (the election) to distract from the allegations against him. Example: "At this time, I will be focusing on the issues of this important election."
17. Straw men – No – The text does not appear to refute an argument that was not presented by an opponent.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text explicitly highlights the charge of hypocrisy by comparing the handling of the Ellison case to the Kavanaugh case. Example: "The Ellison accusations have put Democrats in an uncomfortable position, as they speak out on sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh."

Verdict – 70% – The text is a news report, but it is structured in a way that promotes a specific narrative, making it propagandistic. The headline and opening paragraph immediately frame the story through an "Appeal to Authority" by highlighting the conclusion of a lawyer hired by the accused's own political party. This framing casts "Doubt" on the accuser from the outset. The article then includes quotes from Ellison and his party chairman that employ techniques like "Red Herring," "Obfuscation," and "Thought-terminating clichés" to downplay the allegations. While the article does include the accuser's perspective and her claims of hypocrisy ("Whataboutism"), the primary structure is built around the official party-line dismissal of the allegations. The selection and ordering of information guide the reader toward the conclusion that the allegations are unsubstantiated, which is a key function of propaganda.
