Based on the provided definitions and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – The text describes the predecessors' actions factually ("failed to protect children," "collectively failed") without using insulting labels like "monsters," "evil," or "traitors."
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated insistently throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – The text contains no brief, memorable phrases used as slogans (e.g., "Protect the Children!" or "Never Again!").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the subject matter (child sexual abuse) is inherently frightening, the text reports facts and actions taken (naming accused, removing names, apologies) without using the topic to explicitly instill fear to promote a specific alternative course of action or ideology.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of individuals or institutions reporting on the abuse or involved in the investigation. It reports statements and facts.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text reports the actions (removing names, releasing list of 71 accused, grand jury findings against 300+ priests) and statements ("failed to protect") without obvious hyperbole or downplaying. The scale presented aligns with reported facts.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, national identity, or group identity (like "true Catholics") to bolster the argument or actions.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language used is largely neutral and descriptive ("ordered," "released," "credibly accused," "failed to protect," "apologized"). While words like "predators" and "abuse" have negative connotations, they are accurate descriptors of the subject matter in this factual report, not manipulative emotional appeals beyond describing the events.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There are no comparisons made to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally hated groups to disapprove of the predecessors or the church's past actions.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of the idea of purging names or releasing lists. It explicitly states "No other Catholic prelate has conducted such a blanket purge," indicating it's *not* a popular action.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text reports the bishop's *stated reason* for removing the names ("because they collectively failed to protect children"), which is presented as his motivation, not as a claim that this single action (or the predecessors' failure) is the sole cause of the complex systemic issue of abuse. It also reports other contributing factors like confidentiality agreements and the grand jury investigation.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific: names removed from buildings, 71 accused named, 300+ priests in grand jury report, specific bishop (McCormick) accused, specific actions taken (apology, waivers, new guidelines).
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While the grand jury investigation and the Pope's sanctioning of McCarrick are mentioned, these are reported as factual events or sources of information (like the NY Times), not used as evidence to support a specific claim within an argument presented by the text itself.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text reports the bishop's action and the surrounding context without presenting the situation as having only two possible choices or outcomes. It doesn't frame the issue as "either purge the names or support abuse," for example.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – The text does not employ simplistic phrases designed to shut down critical thought. It reports facts, statements, and actions.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text remains focused on the core topics: the bishop's actions regarding predecessors' names, the release of the list of accused, the grand jury investigation, and the McCarrick case. It does not introduce irrelevant material to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text reports actions and statements. It does not present, attribute, or refute a weaker or misrepresented version of an opposing argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge anyone involved (the bishop, predecessors, accusers, investigators) with hypocrisy by pointing to their other failings or actions.

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is overwhelmingly a straightforward news report detailing factual events: a bishop's specific actions (removing names, releasing a list, apologizing), the context of a grand jury investigation, and related developments (McCarrick case). It uses largely neutral, descriptive language and reports statements from involved parties (bishop, AG spokesman) without employing manipulative techniques to promote a particular ideology, discredit opponents emotionally, or oversimplify complex issues. While the subject matter is highly charged and the bishop's action is significant and symbolic, the *presentation* of the information in this specific text aligns with factual reporting rather than propaganda. The low percentage acknowledges the inherent sensitivity of the topic but reflects the absence of the defined propaganda techniques in the text's construction.
