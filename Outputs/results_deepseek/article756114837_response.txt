1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation:* No insulting labels are used to attack any subject. The text reports neutrally.

4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
   *Explanation:* While the risks of Ebola are highlighted (e.g., urban spread, high fatality rates), this is factual reporting on a health crisis, not an attempt to instill fear to promote an agenda.  

5. **Doubt** – No  
   *Explanation:* No questioning of credibility. Sources (WHO, experts) are cited authoritatively.  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No

   *Explanation:* No appeals to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity.

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No  
    *Explanation:* Details are specific (e.g., case locations, response efforts). No vague or confusing language.  

13. **Appeal to authority** – No  
    *Explanation:* WHO/expert statements are used for factual context, not as manipulative "proof" of a broader agenda.

**Verdict – 5% –**  
The text is a factual news report detailing an Ebola outbreak, citing credible sources (WHO, experts, historical data) and emphasizing public health risks without manipulative intent. While discussing dangers (e.g., potential urban spread) could evoke concern, this stems from legitimate public interest, not propaganda. The tone is informative, not persuasive. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges that *any* crisis reporting might subtly amplify fear, but here it aligns with journalistic standards. No techniques are employed to distort, mislead, or advance an ideological agenda.
