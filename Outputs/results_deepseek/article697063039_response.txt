Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against any object or subject.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message (rising numbers without water/power, dire situation) is stated, but not repeated obsessively in the same words.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to encapsulate a viewpoint or call to action.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the dire consequences (lack of water, power, fleeing, survival difficulty) are described, the text presents them as factual outcomes of the hurricane and lack of aid, not primarily as a tool to instill fear to support a specific idea against alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person, organization, or information source.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The statistics and descriptions (e.g., 90% without power, grid "all but completely destroyed", "devastated", "unprecedented level of destruction", 6-month restoration) are presented as reported facts or official statements without clear evidence of exaggeration or minimization beyond the inherent seriousness of the situation.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There are no appeals to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like "devastated", "wrath", "struggling", "devastating news", "hurricane-ravaged", "survival will get more difficult", and "life too difficult" carry strong negative emotional connotations. Example: "This is devastating news for those living in Puerto Rico".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No disapproval is attempted by linking ideas to hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or action.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The cause of the problems (Hurricane Maria) is clearly stated, and the text acknowledges the complexity (e.g., "unprecedented level of destruction", "almost complete shut-down of business", need for federal aid).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific (e.g., citing percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes, sources like the Governor and a tweet).
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites reports ("Newest reports", "Puerto Rico’s government has reported", "Govt stats on status.pr"), Governor Rosselló's statements, and the White House announcement to support its claims. Example: "Puerto Rico’s government has reported that roughly 10 percent...".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text does not present a complex issue as having only two simplistic choices or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used that shut down critical thinking or discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the hurricane's impact, the lack of resources, the need for aid, and policy decisions (Jones Act). No irrelevant material is introduced.
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented or weaker arguments are set up to be refuted.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy are made against opponents.

**Verdict – 5% –** The text primarily reports factual information about the dire situation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, citing specific statistics (power outages, aid requests), official statements (Governor, White House), and observable consequences (people fleeing, economic standstill). While it uses emotionally charged language (Loaded Language) and cites authorities (Appeal to Authority), these are common in news reporting to convey urgency and establish credibility, respectively. The core purpose appears to be informative, detailing the scale of the disaster and the challenges faced, rather than systematically manipulating the audience towards a specific, unstated agenda using multiple deceptive techniques. The 5% reflects the presence of Loaded Language, which can subtly influence perception, but falls far short of constituting propaganda. The text lacks the hallmark manipulative intent and systematic use of deceptive techniques typical of propaganda.
