Name calling – Yes – The text uses sarcastic and insulting labels to attack its subjects. For example, it refers to Farrakhan as "Calypso Louie" and puts "civil rights hero" in quotation marks with a trademark symbol, "(TM)", to mock and insult Rep. Clyburn.

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the central message of Democrats having "ties to Farrakhan." This idea is reiterated by listing multiple individuals (Rep. Davis, Obama, Rep. Clyburn) and connecting them to the same figure. The phrase "ties to Farrakhan" is used explicitly and the concept is the core, repeated focus of the entire piece.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases designed to be chanted or repeated as a rallying cry.

Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses on exposing alleged hypocrisy and media bias rather than instilling fear in the audience about a future negative outcome.

Doubt – Yes – The text actively works to create doubt about the sincerity and credibility of its subjects. For example, after quoting an Obama spokeswoman's denunciation of Farrakhan, it immediately follows with, "That fails to explain why he met with him." Similarly, regarding Rep. Davis's condemnation, it states, "So it likely doesn't represent his views."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to heighten the drama and importance of the story. The statement, "The media's Farrakhan embargo is collapsing," exaggerates the situation to make the author's side seem more impactful and victorious.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or use nationalistic symbols to make its case. The focus is on partisan politics and media criticism.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's perception. Examples include calling the Obama-Farrakhan photo "infamous" and Rep. Davis's comment "infamous," which frames them as notoriously evil without further explanation.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that covering this story is a growing trend that others should join. It states that the story is "breaking through the embargo" and lists multiple media outlets like CNN, the Washington Post, and The New York Times that are now covering the topic, creating the impression of a rising tide of agreement.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not attribute a complex event to a single, simple cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and is not deliberately obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites news outlets and organizations as evidence to support its claims and lend them credibility. For example, it mentions that the story is being pushed by "committed conservative journalists... especially at the Daily Caller" and that the "Republican Jewish Coalition has already called on the seven other Democrats to resign."

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present the situation as a choice between only two options.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down critical thought; rather, it attempts to provoke it along a specific line of reasoning.

Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central topic of linking Democratic politicians to Louis Farrakhan and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main point.

Straw men – Yes – The text invents a hypothetical, simplified argument for its opponent to then easily attack. It imagines a future defense from Obama, stating, "And then Obama can give a new remix of his Wright speech. 'I can no more disavow Calypso Louie than I can my dead white grandmother.'" This misrepresents a potential nuanced argument as a flippant and absurd statement.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text's central theme is to charge opponents with hypocrisy. It focuses on "civil rights hero" Democrats and their association with Farrakhan, implying they are hypocritical for opposing bigotry while associating with someone known for anti-Semitic views. The final line, "We're starting to have that 'national dialogue' about racism that the left keeps wanting us to have," is a direct charge of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a neutral report but a highly persuasive piece designed to shape opinion against specific political figures and groups. The author employs a wide array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. The piece uses name-calling and loaded language ("Calypso Louie," "infamous") to create a negative emotional response. It systematically instills doubt about the sincerity of politicians' statements and uses the bandwagon technique by listing media outlets to suggest its viewpoint is gaining mainstream traction. The core of the article is built on whataboutism, accusing Democrats of hypocrisy. By citing specific journalists and organizations (appeal to authority) and repeating the central accusation of "ties to Farrakhan," the text constructs a one-sided narrative aimed at discrediting its targets rather than providing a balanced and objective account of events.
