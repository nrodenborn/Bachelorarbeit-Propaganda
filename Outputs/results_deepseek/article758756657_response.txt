Based on the definitions provided and the text "Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia," here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "the most vicious and brutal ideology on the face of the Earth" (referring to Islam).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated verbatim three times.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: The book title "Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance" functions as a slogan encapsulating the core message.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Descriptions of threats against Penkoski and his children ("kill me by stabbing me in the chest... rip my organs out... hang my 3-year-old and 1-year-old") instill fear about opposing the school's actions and the consequences of Islamization.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Is the principal acting on this? And do the police have any interest in this? Or would that be 'islamofauxbic'?" questions the credibility and motives of the principal and police.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: "forced Islamization" exaggerates the nature of a calligraphy exercise. "Large public-school publishers have been bought by the Saudis" is a broad, unsubstantiated claim implying complete control.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: "This is in West Virginia, not Baghdad" appeals to American (specifically West Virginian) identity and location versus a perceived foreign threat.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Numerous examples: "outrage," "egregious submission," "vicious and brutal ideology," "weasel out," "doubling down," "deceptive," "pusher," "frenzy," "offensive," "forced Islamization," "threatened."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Explanation: Linking the curriculum to "Muslim Brotherhood front group" (Islamic Society of North America) and "Hamas-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)" invokes groups widely hated by the target audience to discredit the curriculum push.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Explanation: References protests in Florida ("hundreds protested") and claims it's a "national problem" to imply widespread agreement and encourage joining the opposition.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: "History lessons in Islam are dawah – proselytizing for Islam" oversimplifies the complex reasons for teaching world religions (cultural understanding, history) to a single nefarious cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Large public-school publishers have been bought by the Saudis" is vague (which publishers? What constitutes "bought"? What level of control?) and obscures specifics.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: The author cites her own book ("This is exactly what I warned about in my book...") and presents Rich Penkoski's account as evidence, leveraging her position and his firsthand status.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents the situation as a forced choice between opposing "Islamization" or submitting to it and Sharia law, ignoring nuanced educational purposes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Phrases like "History lessons in Islam are dawah" and "forced Islamization" shut down critical examination of the educational intent.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: The entire poll about "the most corrupt Democrat Politician" is irrelevant to the topic of religious curriculum in schools and serves to distract and inflame.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: "the school is saying that’s not indoctrination or proselytizing?" refutes an argument (that the exercise isn't proselytizing) that the school likely *would* make, framing their defense as inherently weak or dishonest.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Explanation: Penkoski's complaint focuses on comparing the treatment of Islam ("write the shahada," "faith aspects included") to Judaism/Christianity ("no bible verses," "faith aspects left out"), charging the school with hypocrisy in its approach to different religions.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text overwhelmingly employs a wide array of propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is not balanced reporting or reasoned argument but to provoke outrage, fear, and opposition towards the inclusion of Islamic content in school curricula. Key indicators include:
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** Heavy use of loaded language, appeals to fear (threats, violence), and outrage.
*   **Distortion & Oversimplification:** Exaggeration ("forced Islamization," "Saudis bought publishers"), minimization of educational context, causal oversimplification (teaching Islam = proselytizing), and presenting a black-and-white view.
*   **Ad Hominem & Guilt by Association:** Name-calling ("vicious and brutal ideology"), Reduction ad Hitlerum (linking curriculum to MB/CAIR/Hamas).
*   **Distraction & Misdirection:** Inclusion of an irrelevant political poll (Red Herring), Whataboutism focusing on unequal treatment rather than the educational merit of the exercise itself.
*   **Undermining Credibility & Discouraging Thought:** Creating doubt about officials, using thought-terminating clichés, Straw Man arguments against the school's likely position.
*   **Promoting Tribalism:** Appeals to American/West Virginian identity (Flag-Waving) and implying joining a popular resistance (Bandwagon).
While based on a real incident, the text's presentation is heavily slanted, manipulative, and designed to push a specific ideological agenda rather than inform objectively. The sheer density and variety of propaganda techniques used leave little room for balanced discourse within the text itself.
