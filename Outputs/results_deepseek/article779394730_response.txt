Based on the analysis of the propaganda techniques against the provided text, here are the results:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "sodomitical clergy", "lavender liturgy" (Insulting labels attacking clergy and liturgical practices).
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message isn't repeated verbatim multiple times.
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – "#stopthesynod" (A brief, memorable phrase used as a rallying cry).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "I'd sooner let my kids be accompanied by fans of the Oakland Raiders than turn them over to you" (Instills fear about the safety of children with clergy).
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text makes assertions, not questions about credibility.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "rampant homosexuality", "widespread apostasy", "trivialized liturgy" (Exaggerates the prevalence and nature of problems); "can't seem to think of a darn thing, apart from heretical homilies, sodomitical clergy and an increasingly lavender liturgy" (Minimizes/dismisses any positive outcomes from Vatican II/aggiornamento).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or broad group identity beyond the specific Catholic critique.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "sodomitical clergy", "lavender liturgy", "heretical homilies", "widespread apostasy", "rampant homosexuality", "trivialized liturgy", "God of Surprises" (used sarcastically), "uber-merciful" (used sarcastically). These terms carry strong negative emotional connotations and stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt to link ideas to universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to the popularity of the author's viewpoint.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – "What exactly has Vatican II and the last fifty years of aggiornamento given us? Because I can't seem to think of a darn thing, apart from heretical homilies, sodomitical clergy and an increasingly lavender liturgy." (Attributes all listed problems solely and simplistically to Vatican II and aggiornamento).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The language in the commentary is inflammatory but direct and clear in its intent; not deliberately obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – "according to Pope Benedict XVI" (Used to support the claim of a "trivialized liturgy").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The commentary presents Vatican II and the last 50 years as having produced *only* negative outcomes ("can't seem to think of a darn thing, apart from..." the listed negatives).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "You don't say!", "You know what, guys?", "Thanks, but no thanks." (Phrases used to dismiss opposing views or complex issues and shut down discussion).
16. **Red herring** – Yes – "I'd sooner let my kids be accompanied by fans of the Oakland Raiders than turn them over to you... meaning no disrespect to fans of the Oakland Raiders, of course." (Introduces the irrelevant and distracting comparison to Oakland Raiders fans).
17. **Straw men** – Yes – The entire characterization of the "Church of Accompaniment" and "synodal Church" with its "new orientation", overseen by a "God of Surprises" who is "uber-merciful and doesn't judge", etc., is a misrepresentation and extreme caricature of the actual concepts, set up to be easily attacked.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge opponents with hypocrisy by pointing to their own failings.

**Verdict – 70% –** The initial portion of the text (before "REMNANT COMMENT") is largely factual reporting on the release of the grand jury report and its context. However, the "REMNANT COMMENT" section is heavily propagandistic. It employs numerous techniques (Name Calling, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-Terminating Clichés, Red Herring, Straw Men) to advance a specific, highly critical agenda against modern Church leadership, Vatican II reforms, and Pope Francis. The language is inflammatory, relies on emotional manipulation and stereotypes, misrepresents opposing views, uses fallacious reasoning, and aims to provoke a strong negative reaction rather than foster nuanced discussion. While based on a real event (the report), the commentary section is clearly designed to persuade through propaganda. The significant presence of these techniques, concentrated in the commentary which forms a substantial part of the text, warrants a high likelihood assessment.
