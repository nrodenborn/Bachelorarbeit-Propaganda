Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "invasion" (used in Trump's description of the caravan) is an insulting label applied to the migrants' movement.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrase designed to be easily recalled is used as a rallying cry within the main text body reporting on the caravan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Describing the caravan as an "invasion" and detailing the military deployment, barbed wire, aircraft, and night-vision capabilities aims to instill fear about the migrants' arrival and the threat they pose.
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not question the credibility of any specific person, group, or information source.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Using the term "invasion" to describe a migrant caravan is an exaggeration, implying a hostile, organized military force rather than migrants seeking entry.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Highlighting the deployment of US troops ("Army and Marine Corps", "active-duty servicemen") and their actions ("protect", "reinforce", "make it less penetrable") appeals to patriotism and national security.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Words and phrases like "illegal entry," "invasion," "thwart," "less penetrable," "barbed wire," and "blocking their illegal entry" use emotionally charged negative connotations to frame the migrants and the situation.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally hated groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: There is no appeal to the popularity of the idea of stopping the caravan or supporting the policies mentioned. It reports actions and statements.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text reports on actions (caravan moving, troop deployment, policy changes) but does not attribute complex events to single, simple causes.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The reporting on troop numbers, locations, policies, and migrant actions is relatively clear and specific.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: While President Trump's statements and actions are reported, they are presented as factual occurrences (he signed an order, he described the caravan) rather than cited as definitive proof to support a claim within the article's own argument.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not present the situation as having only two possible choices or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: No phrases designed to shut down critical thinking are used.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: The entire embedded poll about Jim Acosta's press pass ("Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?") is completely irrelevant to the topic of the migrant caravan and distracts the reader.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument not actually made in the context of the caravan story.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not charge opponents with hypocrisy regarding the caravan or border policies.

**Verdict – 60% – Explanation:** The text exhibits several clear propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Exaggeration, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Red Herring). The use of emotionally charged language like "invasion" and "illegal entry," the focus on military reinforcement, and the inclusion of the irrelevant Acosta poll are strong indicators of an intent to frame the migrants negatively and evoke fear/nationalism in the reader. However, it also contains significant factual reporting on the caravan's movement, Trump's policy changes, and the military deployment details. This blend of factual reporting with manipulative framing techniques suggests a high likelihood of propaganda aimed at shaping perception, but not purely fabricated information. The purpose leans towards persuasion and fear-mongering regarding immigration, rather than purely neutral reporting.
