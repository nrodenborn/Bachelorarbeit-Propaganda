1. Name calling – Yes – The text attacks opponents with insulting labels such as calling Rod Rosenstein a “Deep State DOJ tool” and referring to the special counsel investigation as a “witch hunt” and a “hoax”.
2. Repetition – Yes – The term “Deep State” is used repeatedly to label the group of officials opposing the president, reinforcing the idea of a shadowy, unified conspiracy. The concept of Trump wanting transparency is also repeated.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the brief and memorable phrase “witch hunt” to dismiss the entire investigation.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses the word “insurrection” to describe the actions of the DOJ and other officials. This term implies a violent, unlawful overthrow of the government, instilling fear about the actions of these officials.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to question the credibility and motives of the Department of Justice, the FBI, and Democratic lawmakers, suggesting they are part of a conspiracy to hide the truth from the public.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the situation by calling it an “insurrection” and claims officials are in “panic mode.” It minimizes the complexity of declassifying sensitive documents by stating “Trump is simply asking for full transparency.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the conflict as the “US President” acting on behalf of “every American citizen” and being empowered by the “US Constitution” against a subversive internal force.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like “insurrection,” “panic mode,” “witch hunt,” “hoax,” and “spy” to influence the reader’s perception.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular with a group like Nazis or other similarly hated groups to discredit it.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is good simply because it is popular. It focuses on a conflict of authority rather than an appeal to popular opinion.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex event. It claims the entire multi-faceted conflict over declassification is caused by a “Deep State” conspiracy to hide the “hoax” of Trump-Russia collusion, ignoring legitimate national security concerns or procedural disagreements.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The term “Deep State” is used as a vague, catch-all label for a supposed conspiracy. The text never defines who is specifically in this group or how it operates, leaving it intentionally obscure to encompass any opponent.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly cites President Trump’s authority (“Trump, as president, has the power to override the agencies”) as justification for his actions, using his position as evidence of the correctness of his order.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: Trump’s desire for “full transparency” (good) versus the “Deep State” doing everything to “make sure the truth... remains hidden” (evil). It ignores any nuanced middle ground, such as a redacted release balancing transparency and security.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “This is all you need to know about the hoax” is a classic example, designed to discourage the reader from seeking more information or considering alternative perspectives.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text includes a promotional block for a book (“The Deep State: The Fa... Mike Lofgren”) with a link to buy it. This is irrelevant to the news event being discussed and serves to distract the reader while reinforcing the author's frame.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the argument that opponents want to “make sure the truth... remains hidden.” However, the actual argument presented by Democrats in the quoted letter is a concern about interfering in an “ongoing law enforcement investigation.” The text misrepresents their position to make it seem more sinister and easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text accuses opponents of wrongdoing but does not use the specific tactic of deflecting criticism by charging them with hypocrisy for a separate, unrelated past action.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. The analysis shows the presence of 15 out of the 18 listed propaganda techniques, which are woven together to create a compelling but highly manipulative narrative. The piece does not aim to inform neutrally but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, conspiratorial worldview. It establishes a simple good-versus-evil conflict (Black & White Fallacy) between a patriotic President (Flag-Waving, Appeal to Authority) and a sinister, vaguely defined “Deep State” (Name Calling, Obfuscation). This conflict is amplified with emotionally charged language (Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear, Exaggeration) to create a sense of crisis. The entire complex political and legal situation is reduced to a simple cause: a conspiracy to hide a “hoax” (Causal Oversimplification). Finally, the text actively discourages critical thinking by misrepresenting opposing arguments (Straw Men) and telling the audience that its simplified version is all they need to know (Thought-Terminating Clichés). The sheer density and combination of these techniques confirm its function as propaganda.
