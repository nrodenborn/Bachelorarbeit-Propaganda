Name calling – Yes – The text labels Keith Ellison a “Cop Killer Supporter” in the headline and refers to him as the “epitome of an effeminate man.”

Repetition – Yes – The question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief, memorable phrase to rally support for its own cause.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting a supporter of “cop killers” and someone who follows a “demonic religion” could become the “top law enforcement job in Minnesota.”

Doubt – Yes – The text questions Ellison’s credibility by stating he is “running to be attorney general in Minnesota, even though he possesses no attorney's license that is valid.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the journalist’s actions by repeatedly describing her as a “woman, armed with a mic and camera phone” to exaggerate the perceived cowardice of Ellison calling the police.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as describing Islam as a “demonic religion” and Ellison as an “effeminate man.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of Ellison by association, stating he served on the steering committee for the National Lawyers Guild, which it labels an “old Communist front group.”

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its position is popular and that the reader should join the majority.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies Ellison’s complex political history by labeling him a “Cop Killer Supporter,” implying his past associations are the sole and direct cause for this label, ignoring other possible interpretations or contexts.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague; its accusations are direct and specific, even if biased.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites “Scott Johnson” and his article in “The Weekly Standard” as an authority to support its claims about Ellison’s history.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy where Ellison either supports the police or supports “cop killers,” ignoring any possibility of nuance, such as advocating for police reform while still believing in law enforcement.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The article does not use clichés to end discussion; instead, it provides extensive, albeit one-sided, details to support its argument.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll asking “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?”, which is completely irrelevant to the article’s topic of Keith Ellison and serves only to distract and gather user data.

Straw men – Yes – The article builds a straw man by labeling Ellison a “Cop Killer Supporter” and then attacks this caricature, rather than addressing his actual, more complex positions on criminal justice or his own explanations for his past.

Whataboutism – No – The text accuses Ellison of hypocrisy but does not use this to deflect from a criticism of the author or their own side. The accusation of hypocrisy is the main point of the attack, not a deflection.

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt an extremely negative view of Keith Ellison by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques. The article begins with aggressive name-calling in the headline and uses emotionally loaded language throughout (e.g., "demonic religion," "effeminate man," "sordid history") to provoke an emotional response rather than a rational one. It relies heavily on logical fallacies such as causal oversimplification and the black & white fallacy to frame Ellison's complex history in the most negative light possible, creating a straw man of him as a "cop killer supporter" that it then proceeds to attack. The piece makes no attempt at journalistic objectivity; it presents no counterarguments, context, or statements from Ellison's perspective that aren't immediately dismissed or framed as a lie. The inclusion of an irrelevant red herring poll further demonstrates that the article's goal is not purely informational. The sheer density and variety of propaganda techniques used confirm that this is a targeted attack piece designed to shape opinion through manipulation.
