Verdict – 80% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, obfuscation, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques work together to cast doubt on the official narrative of the Las Vegas shooting and suggest a cover-up without providing concrete evidence. The presence of these techniques indicates a high likelihood that the text is propaganda aimed at influencing public perception and opinion.
