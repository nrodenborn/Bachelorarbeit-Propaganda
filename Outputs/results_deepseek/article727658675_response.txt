2. **Repetition** – Yes – "sanctity and indissolubility of marriage" is repeated 3 times; "constant truths" is repeated twice.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage" acts as a memorable, branded phrase.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings that interpretations of *Amoris Laetitia* will cause "rampant confusion," spread a "plague of divorce," and enable "sexual depravity."  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions the credibility of pastoral norms implementing *Amoris Laetitia*, calling them "alien to the Church’s entire faith and Tradition."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates consequences (e.g., "plague of divorce") and minimizes opposing views as "tantamount to an allowance to sin."

13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Relies on bishops’ roles as "Successors of the Apostles" to validate their stance: "We could not act in another way."

---

**Verdict – 70%** – The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements, primarily through **loaded language**, **fear appeals**, **bandwagoning**, and **straw-man arguments** to discredit interpretations of *Amoris Laetitia*. It frames dissenters as defenders of "immutable truths" while portraying opposing views as enabling moral decay. However, it stops short of outright falsehoods by reporting factual events (e.g., bishop signatories) and quoting sources directly. The 70% likelihood reflects its persuasive intent and biased framing, though it retains a veneer of theological debate. Key indicators include emotional manipulation, oversimplification of causes, and suppression of nuanced discussion via absolutist language.
