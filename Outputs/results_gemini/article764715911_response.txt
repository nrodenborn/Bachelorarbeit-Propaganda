Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast majority (14 out of 18) of the listed techniques, indicating a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than engage in a reasoned debate. The piece relies heavily on emotional manipulation through name-calling ("anti-American," "Socialist"), flag-waving (appeals to the Constitution), and loaded language. It actively derails the core argument by introducing red herrings (the political poll) and using whataboutism (deflecting to the FDA and Big Pharma) to attack the AMA's credibility instead of addressing its proposals on their merits. The use of straw men and causal oversimplification further demonstrates that the author's goal is not to inform but to persuade by discrediting the opposition through rhetorical fallacies.
