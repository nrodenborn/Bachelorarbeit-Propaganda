1. Name calling – No – The text does not attack a person, group, or subject with an insulting label. It uses the historical term "Black Death," but this is not used as a pejorative against a target.
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the plague will inevitably spread to other parts of the world, particularly the UK, is repeated throughout the text. Example: “The fear that the disease will spread to the United Kingdom has been confirmed as ‘100 percent likely.’” and “I believe that it’s 100 percent likely that plague will arrive in the UK once more – it’s just a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’.”
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses short, memorable, and alarming phrases to create a sense of urgency and danger. Example: a “‘ticking time bomb’ ready to decimate the world”
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The entire article is structured to create fear about the plague spreading globally and becoming an unstoppable pandemic. Example: "Others worry the plague will go beyond mainland Africa and eventually reach the US, Europe, and Britain. The plague spreads easily and can kill within 48 hours."
5. Doubt – No – The text does not explicitly question the credibility of a person or source. It presents conflicting expert opinions to heighten drama, but does not directly cast doubt on them.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses extreme language to exaggerate the certainty and scale of the threat. Example: "Conway is saying it’s ‘only a matter of time’ before the disease arrives on British soil. ‘I believe that it’s 100 percent likely that plague will arrive in the UK once more...'"
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions specific countries like the UK and US as potential targets but does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its point.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses words with strong emotional connotations to influence the reader's perception of the situation. Example: "Richard Conroy, the founder of Sick Holiday, has sent a chilling warning to UK authorities."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text appeals to authority rather than the popularity of an idea among the general public. It does not suggest that the reader should believe something because "everyone else" does.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex process of a global pandemic down to a single, inevitable cause. Example: "Conroy warned it is inevitable that the plague will spread due to the vast movement of people across the globe."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text's message is direct and clear in its attempt to be alarming; it does not use intentionally vague or confusing language to obscure its point.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites experts to lend credibility to its claims, even when the expert's field (founder of a holiday sickness company) may not be directly relevant to epidemiology. Example: "Paul Hunter, a professor of health protection at the world-renowned University of East Anglia, was the first expert to predict the plague could travel across the sea."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as having only two outcomes: the plague is contained, or it will inevitably cause global devastation. Example: "If we don’t carry on doing stuff here, at one point something will happen and it will get out of our control and cause huge devastation all around the world.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a phrase that presents a conclusion as inevitable, discouraging further critical thought on the matter. Example: "it’s just a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’."
16. Red herring – No – The article stays focused on the central topic of the plague outbreak and its potential to spread. It does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent an opposing argument in order to more easily refute it.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an opponent by accusing them of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While based on a real-world event, its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader of a terrifying outcome. It achieves this by heavily relying on a core set of propaganda techniques. The entire piece is an exercise in **Appeal to fear**, using **Loaded Language** ("chilling warning," "decimate the world") and dramatic **Exaggeration** ("100 % Likely") to create a sense of panic. It reinforces its alarmist message through **Repetition** and lends it a veneer of credibility by using **Appeal to authority**, quoting experts to support its frightening narrative. Finally, it shuts down critical thinking by employing a **Black & white fallacy** (we are either fine or doomed) and a **Thought-terminating cliché** ("when, not if"), framing a global pandemic as an inevitability rather than a complex issue with varying levels of risk and many potential outcomes. The combination and intensity of these techniques show a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions rather than provide a balanced, objective report.
