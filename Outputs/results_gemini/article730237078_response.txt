Verdict – 0% – This text is not propaganda; it is an informational news article. Although it uses two techniques listed (Loaded Language and Appeal to Authority), their application is within the normal bounds of journalistic writing. The purpose of propaganda is to promote a specific, often political, point of view by manipulating emotions and information. This text's purpose is to inform the public about a scientific achievement. The "Appeal to Authority" is a standard journalistic practice of citing an expert source to provide credible information. The "Loaded Language" is used for stylistic effect to make the article engaging and convey a sense of wonder, not to deceive or manipulate the reader into adopting a biased viewpoint. The article lacks the manipulative intent, distortion of facts, and promotion of a specific ideology that are the hallmarks of propaganda.
