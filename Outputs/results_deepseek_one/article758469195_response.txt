6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No

### Verdict – 10% –  
**Explanation**: The text is a straightforward news report from Al Jazeera, citing official sources (e.g., Pompeo, Nauert) and detailing events without overt bias. It presents facts neutrally: describing symptoms, investigations, and historical context (Cuba incidents). No propaganda techniques are detected, as the language avoids emotional manipulation, oversimplification, or agenda-driven framing. The 10% likelihood accounts for inherent institutional perspectives in any media, but the article prioritizes factual reporting over persuasion. Key indicators include:  
- Attribution of claims (e.g., "Pompeo said," "embassy issued").  
- Balanced context (e.g., noting varied symptoms, multiple theories, China's non-comment).  
- Absence of loaded language, fear appeals, or rhetorical fallacies.  
Thus, it is primarily informational, not propagandistic.
