Name calling – Yes – The text labels Islam as the “most vicious and brutal ideology on the face of the Earth.”
Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is repeated three times in a row.
Slogans – Yes – The phrase “Islamizing the Schools” is used as the title and the concept of “Islamization” is used throughout to create a memorable, negative frame for the events.
Appeal to fear – Yes – The text details graphic death threats made against a parent and his young children, such as: “A student in the school threatened to get her adult friends to come to my home and kill me by stabbing me in the chest and ripping my organs out.”
Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and motives of the school administration by asking, “What do they have to hide?”
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of a school assignment by framing it as “forced Islamization” and an “egregious submission to the most vicious and brutal ideology on the face of the Earth.”
Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to national identity by contrasting an American location with a foreign one: “This is in West Virginia, not Baghdad.”
Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases such as “outrage,” “egregious submission,” and “weasel out” to influence the reader's emotions.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – While the text links ideas to groups the audience is expected to dislike (e.g., Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood), it does not make a comparison to Hitler or the Nazis.
Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests a growing movement against the issue by stating, “Rich Penkoski is hardly the first to protest this egregious submission... In Volusia County, Florida, hundreds protested Islamic lessons”.
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a complex curriculum decision as having a simple, sinister cause: a deliberate plot of “forced Islamization” and that “History lessons in Islam are dawah – proselytizing for Islam.”
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague; its claims and accusations are direct and clear, even if they are inflammatory.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites her own book as an authoritative source on the subject: “This is exactly what I warned about in my book, Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance”.
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by contrasting the treatment of Islam with the other religions, stating, “The faith aspects and the same considerations were not given to the others as they were for Islam,” ignoring other potential explanations for the differences in lesson materials.
Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “This is in West Virginia, not Baghdad” is used to shut down nuanced discussion by invoking a simple, uncritical patriotic sentiment.
Red herring – Yes – The text includes a poll that is completely irrelevant to the story about the school: “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?”
Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that was not presented by equating a calligraphy exercise with religious conversion, stating “Saying the shahada makes you a Muslim,” and then arguing against this forced conversion, which was not the school’s intention.
Whataboutism – No – The text makes direct accusations but does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy on another issue.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic, employing a vast majority (14 out of 18) of the listed techniques. Its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint by bypassing rational discourse in favor of emotional manipulation. The article consistently uses loaded language (“outrage,” “vicious and brutal ideology”), name-calling, and appeals to fear (graphic death threats) to create a sense of crisis and anger. It frames a school lesson as a sinister plot through exaggeration (“forced Islamization”) and causal oversimplification (blaming a global conspiracy for a single assignment). The use of a red herring (the unrelated political poll) and flag-waving (“This is in West Virginia, not Baghdad”) further serves to manipulate the reader’s emotions and create an "us vs. them" narrative. The entire piece is constructed to promote an alarmist agenda rather than present a factual, balanced account of events.
