1. Name calling – Yes – The text reports that Trump has referred to Sessions as one of his "favorite pinatas," which is an insulting label meant to demean him.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text quotes Sessions claiming "unprecedented success at effectuating the President’s agenda," which is a potential exaggeration. It also reports Trump's claim that Sessions "never" took control, which is also an exaggeration.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Jeff Sessions appeals to the authority of his position as Attorney General to lend weight to his rebuttal, stating, “While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.”

Verdict – 10% – This text is a news article from a news agency (CQ-Roll Call) reporting on a public conflict between two political figures, not a piece of propaganda itself. The primary purpose of the article is to inform the reader about the events that transpired, specifically the exchange of statements between Trump and Sessions. It maintains a journalistic tone by attributing statements, quoting the individuals directly, and providing context for their dispute.

However, the article *contains* statements from political figures that use numerous propaganda techniques (as identified above). The quotes from Trump and Sessions employ techniques like name-calling, doubt, exaggeration, and flag-waving to attack each other or defend their own positions. The article is *reporting on* the use of propaganda, rather than being an example of it. The low 10% likelihood accounts for the fact that any journalistic piece involves editorial choices in what to quote and how to frame the story (e.g., using words like "lashes back" and "fired back"), but its fundamental structure and intent are informational, not persuasive in the propagandistic sense.
