**Verdict – 10% –**  
**Explanation:** The text is primarily a factual summary of accusations against Senator Al Franken and his responses, as well as the political context of his resignation. It does not employ most propaganda techniques, with the possible exception of introducing some doubt by including Franken’s denials and statements of forgetfulness. However, this is standard journalistic practice to present both the accusations and the subject’s response, rather than a manipulative attempt to sway opinion. The language is neutral, avoids emotional manipulation, and does not push a particular agenda. Therefore, the likelihood that this text is propaganda is very low—about 10%—and it is best characterized as a straightforward news report.
