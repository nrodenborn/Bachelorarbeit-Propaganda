Name calling – Yes – The headline labels the attacker a “Communist Door Boy,” using “Communist” as an insulting label and “Door Boy” to diminish him. The text also refers to the “dangerous and violent predilections of the left.”

Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to promote its own message.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests a dangerous trend by stating the “dangerous and violent predilections of the left reared its ugly head once again” and asks, “Where Trump supporters can't even have a meal in peace?” This instills fear that political opponents are making the country unsafe for a specific group.

Doubt – Yes – The text places the word “man” in quotation marks when referring to the attacker, questioning his status or character: “A “man” attacked a teenager…”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the actions of one individual to represent the entire “left.” It also minimizes the fact that the attacker was fired and disavowed by his party by immediately pivoting to blame a broader political group.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The embedded tweet includes an American flag emoji. The source of the article, “Constitution.com,” and the publisher, “Freedom Outpost,” appeal to American patriotism and identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “dangerous and violent predilections,” “reared its ugly head,” and “criminal attacker” to evoke strong negative emotions.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with hated groups like Nazis to discredit it.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea as a reason to support it.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple cause for the attack by linking it to Maxine Waters’ comments and then blaming the Democratic party, stating, “The reality is that the Democrats are as much to blame for the corrosive and ugly rhetoric in America today as Donald Trump is.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses the vague phrase “Some on the right have connected the attack to Maxine Waters’ call…” to introduce an idea without providing a specific source or taking ownership of the claim.

Appeal to authority – No – While the text quotes authorities like the attacker’s employer and political party, it does so to report their condemnation of the act, not to use their support as evidence for the article’s main argument.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh presents only two choices: “Yes, he will be confirmed” or “No, he will not be confirmed.” The overall narrative also frames the situation as innocent Trump supporters versus the violent “left.”

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common, simple phrases or clichés designed to end discussion.

Red herring – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation is inserted into the middle of the article and is completely irrelevant to the story about the assault, serving as a distraction.

Straw men – Yes – The text sets up a straw man by saying, “Contrary to what you might believe about Jimenez… he is/was NOT a Democrat!” It refutes an assumption the reader may not have held in order to pivot its argument towards the entire “Left.”

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy. It is the source of the accusation.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. While it is centered around a factual event, its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader toward a specific political viewpoint by employing a multitude of propaganda techniques. The article begins with inflammatory name-calling in the headline (“Communist Door Boy”) and uses loaded language throughout to frame the incident not as the action of one individual, but as a symptom of the inherent violence of "the left." It uses causal oversimplification to link the attack to a politician from a party the attacker wasn't even a member of, thereby blaming the entire Democratic party. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring poll about Brett Kavanaugh further demonstrates that the article's intent is not journalistic. The piece systematically uses the actions of one person—who was promptly fired by his employer and disavowed by his political party—to stoke fear and anger against a broad political group, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
