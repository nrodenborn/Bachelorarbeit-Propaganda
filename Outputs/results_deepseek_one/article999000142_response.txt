### Verdict – 85% – Explanation:  
The text is highly likely to be propaganda due to its consistent use of multiple persuasive techniques aimed at vilifying Hillary Clinton and promoting a partisan narrative. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded language ("disgusting," "criminals") and appeals to fear (e.g., "near lynching") dominate the text.  
- **Distortion of events**: Exaggerates Clinton’s comment to imply blanket racism, ignores her broader context about inclusivity, and distracts with unrelated claims (e.g., "her many crimes").  
- **Partisan framing**: Uses whataboutism and false dichotomies to contrast liberal "hypocrisy" with conservative victimhood.  
- **Repetition and bias**: The triplicate poll question reinforces anti-immigrant sentiment, while selective quoting omits Clinton’s condemnation of stereotypes.  
While based on a real incident (Clinton’s gaffe), the text’s sensationalism, lack of neutral analysis, and overt agenda-pushing align with propaganda. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the incident itself occurred, but the presentation is overwhelmingly manipulative.
