1. Name calling – Yes – The author labels Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) as a “radical anti-Israel hate group with links to anti-Semitism.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The phrase “#BDStears” is repeated multiple times to mock the reactions of BDS activists.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the hashtag “#BDStears” as a brief, memorable, and derisive phrase to label the complaints of BDS activists.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses more on anger, ridicule, and discrediting the opposition rather than instilling fear in the audience about a potential future outcome.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text seeks to undermine the credibility of Dan Fishback by framing his arguments as “whining” and “entitled nonsense.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by equating the actions of BDS activists to wanting to “burn crosses on their lawn,” a highly inflammatory and disproportionate comparison.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to Jewish identity by framing the issue as a defense of “the human rights of the Jewish people” and accusing opponents of having “lost a key aspect of their Jewishness.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like “whines,” “hate group,” and “entitled nonsense” to evoke negative feelings towards the subjects.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of Dan Fishback by associating him with hated groups, stating, “Him, the PLO and the KKK,” when describing who feels unwelcome in Jewish spaces.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. Instead, it frames the conflict as a struggle against a supposedly growing but dangerous movement.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not attempt to explain a complex event with a single simple cause; its focus is on attacking the character and motives of its opponents.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and aggressive in its language and purpose; it does not use vague or obscure expressions to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The author does not cite any external authorities to support their own claims; they present their own arguments as self-evident.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy where one either supports the author's view of “Jewish nationhood” or one is an anti-Semite who sides with “hate groups.” It dismisses any nuanced position, as seen in: “But the only dissent and argument that Jews are supposed to welcome is that of people who hate the existence of Jewish nationhood.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to end discussion; instead, it makes aggressive and inflammatory arguments to provoke a reaction.
16. Red herring – No – The arguments, while often fallacious, remain focused on the central topic of Dan Fishback, BDS, and JVP. The author does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author misrepresents the opponents' position by equating their desire to be included in Jewish community spaces with a desire to “burn crosses on their lawn,” a grotesque caricature of their actual argument.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text’s central argument is a charge of hypocrisy: “Previously Dan Fishback had authored an article arguing for boycotting some Israeli plays. Now he's whining that boycotting his play is a violation of Jewishness”.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform or engage in reasoned debate, but to discredit and demonize its opponents (Dan Fishback, JVP, and the BDS movement) through emotional manipulation and logical fallacies. The piece is saturated with techniques such as Name-calling (“hate group”), Loaded Language (“whines,” “entitled nonsense”), and Repetition (“#BDStears”). It employs extreme Exaggeration and a Straw Man fallacy by equating a political disagreement with wanting to “burn crosses on their lawn.” It uses Reduction ad Hitlerum by associating its target with the “PLO and the KKK.” The entire argument is framed as a Whataboutism fallacy, focusing on the opponent's alleged hypocrisy rather than the substance of the issue. Furthermore, it uses Flag-Waving by appealing to a specific version of Jewish identity and a Black & White Fallacy to create a stark "us vs. them" narrative. The high density and combination of these techniques demonstrate a clear intent to persuade through non-rational means, making it a strong example of propaganda.
