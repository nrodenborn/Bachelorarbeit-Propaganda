Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the people Linda Sarsour is associated with as "the worst of the worst."

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases intended for repeated use.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text links a political figure (Linda Sarsour) and "the left" to terrifying events like a "school shooting" plot and the "bombing of the World Trade Center," creating fear around them and their ideology.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is framed to cast doubt on the credibility and judgment of Linda Sarsour and "the left" by associating them with the subjects of the criminal investigation.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The phrase "climbed into bed with the worst of the worst" is an exaggeration used to describe the association between "the left," Linda Sarsour, and the individuals in the news story.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "worst of the worst," "filthy New Mexico compound," and "radical speakers" to evoke negative emotions and stereotypes.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparison to Hitler or the Nazi party.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular or that the reader should agree because many others do.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text creates a simplistic and misleading causal chain suggesting that because "the left" chose Linda Sarsour as a role model, they are directly associated with and implicitly support the alleged crimes of her mentor's son.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The connection between Linda Sarsour and the actual crime is made intentionally vague and reliant on multiple degrees of separation (Sarsour -> elder Wahhaj -> younger Wahhaj). The text also uses phrases like "possible co-conspirator" to imply guilt without a factual basis.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites legitimate authorities like "prosecutors," "court documents," and the "Taos County Sheriff" to report on the crime, lending credibility to the article which is then used to support the unsubstantiated opening claim about Linda Sarsour and "the left."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The embedded poll explicitly presents only two choices: "Yes, he will be confirmed" or "No, he will not be confirmed." The article's framing also implies a false dichotomy: one is either with "the left" and its associated evils, or against them.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down discussion.

Red herring – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation is entirely unrelated to the main topic of the article and serves to distract the reader.

Straw men – No – The text primarily makes accusations rather than misrepresenting and refuting an opponent's argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing its opponents of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to form a negative opinion of Linda Sarsour and "the left" through a powerful "guilt by association" fallacy. It begins with a highly biased, emotionally charged claim and then presents a factual news story about a horrific crime. It then constructs a tenuous chain of connections (Sarsour's mentor is the father of the accused man, who was a "possible" but uncharged co-conspirator in a past event) to link the initial target (Sarsour) to the crime. This structure is designed to make the initial biased claim seem credible. The use of numerous propaganda techniques—including Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, and a blatant Red Herring (the Kavanaugh poll)—confirms that the article's intent is manipulative persuasion rather than objective reporting. While it contains factual elements from news reports, they are framed and weaponized to serve a propagandistic goal.
