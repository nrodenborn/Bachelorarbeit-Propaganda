Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to the subject (Cody Wilson, 3D-printed guns, or opposing parties). Descriptions like "gun rights advocate" or "menace to society" are descriptive or critical opinions, not direct insults like "traitor" or "monster".
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific message or phrase is repeated excessively throughout the text to hammer it home. Key points are stated once or twice for reporting.
3.  **Slogans** – No – The text contains quotes like "access to firearms is a fundamental human dignity" or "The debate is over", but these are statements within quotes, not brief, memorable phrases used independently as slogans like "Build the Wall".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The arguments against the blueprints rely heavily on instilling fear: "...blueprints could allow anyone -- from a teen to a 'lone wolf' gunman -- to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons." and "...3D-printed firearms 'nothing short of a menace to society.'" These paint a fearful picture of the consequences.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text reports statements and actions (e.g., White House distancing, court rulings) but does not explicitly question the credibility of a person or institution in a way that fits the "Doubt" technique. It presents facts and quotes.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text reports claims made by others (e.g., "menace to society", "fundamental human right", "waste all my time") but does not itself demonstrably exaggerate or minimize facts beyond reporting these opinions. The description of the steel block workaround is factual.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There are no appeals to patriotism, national identity, or concepts like "We the People" to garner support for a position within this text. The arguments are framed legally and in terms of public safety or rights.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged or value-laden words are used, particularly by critics quoted in the text: "wrong hands", "'lone wolf' gunman", "menace to society", "dangerous and reckless actions". These words evoke strong negative emotions.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There are no comparisons made to Nazis, Hitler, or universally hated groups to disapprove of an idea or person in this text.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – While multiple states and senators are mentioned as opposing the blueprints, the text does not frame this as a reason to agree (e.g., "everyone is doing it, so you should too"). It reports the scale of opposition factually.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text does not attribute complex events (like gun violence or legal battles) to overly simple causes. It presents multiple factors (legal history, technical details, political stances).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific about the events, legal positions, technical aspects (like the steel block), and statements from various parties. It does not use deliberately unclear language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While authorities are cited (Judge Lasnik, White House, NRA, Courts), their statements and rulings are reported as facts of their position within the story, not used as the *primary* evidence to convince the reader of the *truth* of a claim beyond reporting their stance. The NRA's claim about existing law is presented as their argument.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents the complexity of the issue, including legal nuances (the steel block workaround), differing viewpoints (Wilson vs. States/NRA vs. Brady Campaign), and the ongoing legal process. It does not reduce the issue to only two simplistic choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking or discussion (e.g., "It is what it is", "That's just the way things are"). Arguments and counter-arguments are presented with reasoning.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the core issue of publishing 3D-printed gun blueprints, the legal battle, safety concerns, and political reactions. It does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text accurately represents the arguments of the involved parties (Wilson's rights claim, states'/Brady's safety fears, NRA's legal argument, White House's position). No significant misrepresentation of an opponent's argument is evident.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No party in the text charges another with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions on unrelated matters. Criticisms are focused directly on the issue of 3D-printed guns and the blueprints.

**Verdict – 15% – Explanation:** The text is primarily a straightforward news report detailing a legal and political controversy surrounding 3D-printed gun blueprints. It presents multiple perspectives (Cody Wilson/Defense Distributed, the suing states, the White House, the NRA, gun control groups like the Brady Campaign) and reports facts, legal rulings, and statements from these parties. While it includes quotes that *contain* propaganda techniques (specifically **Appeal to Fear** and **Loaded Language** used by opponents of the blueprints), these techniques originate from the sources quoted within the article (the states' argument, the Brady Campaign statement), not from the article's own narrative voice. The article itself reports these statements neutrally as part of the story. The bulk of the text provides factual context, legal history, technical details about compliance attempts, and reports on actions taken (lawsuits, injunctions, legislation proposals, fundraising). There is no dominant, overarching propagandistic message being pushed *by the article itself*; it serves to inform about the situation. The presence of fear appeals and loaded language within quotes slightly elevates the likelihood beyond 0%, but the core reporting is factual and multi-perspective, making the overall text unlikely to be classified as propaganda itself.
