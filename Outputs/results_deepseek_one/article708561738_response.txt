Here is the analysis of the text according to the defined propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "corrupt career politicians", "grassroots deplorables" (used self-referentially but still employs the loaded term).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The title/question "How Do You Like Paying For Sexual Harassment Settlements from Your Congress, America?" is repeated verbatim at the beginning.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "It is time to drain the swamp".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "you and I have been paying to cover up the epidemic of sexual harassment", implying taxpayer complicity in a hidden, widespread problem and financial burden.
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – No direct questioning of a specific entity's credibility in the manner defined.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "epidemic of sexual harassment", "come to a screeching halt" (exaggeration). Minimization is less evident.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "The American people have a right to know", "We are not going to send people that engage in sexually inappropriate behavior to Washington anymore" (Appeals to American identity and values).
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Pervasive: "cover up the epidemic", "corrupt career politicians", "sex trade on Capitol Hill", "drain the swamp", "engaging in this type of behavior" (all carry strong negative connotations).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis or Hitler.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "So I am asking you to support my campaign and other “grassroots deplorables” that are running for office all over the nation" (Appeal to join a growing movement).
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – "If such a law was instituted, I guarantee you that sexual harassment on Capitol Hill would come to a screeching halt" (Assumes a single law change would completely solve a complex social problem).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The arguments and accusations are presented directly, not obscured.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites figures from Reid Wilson (The Hill correspondent) and the Congressional Office of Compliance, and quotes "one ex-House aide", "a former Senate staffer", and "one political veteran" to support claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the solution as binary: either boot out the corrupt politicians and elect the author/grassroots deplorables, or the harassment continues unchecked ("It isn’t going to stop until we boot out...").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "It is time to drain the swamp" (A well-known, emotionally charged phrase used to end the argument and spur action without deeper discussion).
16. **Red herring** – **Possible/Weak** – The discussion of reciprocated advances ("sex trade") could be seen as slightly deflecting from the core issue of harassment perpetrated by powerful figures, though it's related to the environment. Not the strongest example.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Does not explicitly refute an argument not presented.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Does not charge opponents with hypocrisy on this specific issue.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a significant number of classic propaganda techniques (Name-calling, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Bandwagon, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating clichés, and Repetition) to advance a specific political agenda. Its primary goal is not balanced information but to provoke anger and resentment ("you and I have been paying"), instill fear about an "epidemic" covered up with taxpayer money, discredit the current political establishment ("corrupt career politicians"), promote an "us vs. them" narrative ("grassroots deplorables" vs. the corrupt), oversimplify the solution (just pass *this* law or elect *us*), and rally support for the author's campaign and similar candidates under the emotionally charged banner of "drain the swamp." The selective use of facts (settlement figures) serves primarily to fuel this emotional and accusatory narrative rather than foster nuanced discussion. The pervasive use of loaded language and appeals to emotion/fear/patriotism solidify its propagandistic nature.
