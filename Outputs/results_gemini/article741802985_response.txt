Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – The title refers to the FBI as “Willfully Ignorant” and the suspect as a “Muslim Jihadi,” applying insulting and conclusive labels before an official motive was determined.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The core idea that the attack is part of a “global jihad” and that there is a “war going on” is repeated multiple times in the author’s commentary to reinforce the message.
3.  **Slogans** – No – The text uses strong, repeated phrases, but not in the form of a brief, catchy slogan designed for mass appeal.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text stokes fear by stating “there is a war going on,” that jihadist groups want to “kill military personnel and police, as well as civilians,” and that the FBI’s inaction is “catastrophic.”
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The entire piece is designed to cast doubt on the FBI’s competence and integrity, stating they have a “track record of denial and deception” and that their bafflement is “part of its deep, deep corruption.”
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The author exaggerates the FBI’s statement of uncertainty (“we don’t have any nexus… at this point”) into a claim of “deep, deep corruption” and a “catastrophic” waste of resources.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by highlighting that the attack was on a “U.S. Air Force Base” and that the targets of the “global jihad” are American “military personnel,” framing the issue as a matter of national defense.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like “Willfully Ignorant,” “Muslim Jihadi,” “denial and deception,” and “deep, deep corruption” to provoke an emotional response rather than a rational one.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – The author makes a direct comparison between the FBI’s investigation and the actions of the U.S. Army fighting Nazi Germany during the Battle of the Bulge, associating the FBI’s approach with a level of absurdity one would apply to fighting Hitler.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular or that “everyone” agrees with it.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The author dismisses the need for a thorough investigation by asserting a single, simple cause for a complex event: “when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad.”
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The author’s position and accusations are stated with extreme clarity and directness, not vagueness.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The article is presented under the authority of “Robert Spencer,” a figure whose views are central to the argument. The text relies on his interpretation as the authoritative one, contrasted against the official (and, in the author's view, incorrect) sources like the FBI.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text presents only two options: the event is an act of Islamic jihad, or the FBI is corrupt and willfully ignorant. It completely dismisses other potential motives like individual mental health issues or personal grievances.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – The phrase “And that is that there is a war going on” is used as a definitive statement to shut down further discussion or consideration of nuance regarding the individual’s specific motive.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text remains consistently focused on its central argument about the attacker’s motive and the FBI’s alleged incompetence, without introducing irrelevant topics to distract.
17. **Straw men** – Yes – The author refutes an argument the FBI never made by sarcastically listing simplistic evidence they must be looking for (“an ISIS membership card in his wallet,” “a note… reading, ‘I did this for Allah’”) to make the official investigation appear foolish.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text attacks the FBI directly for its handling of the current case but does not deflect criticism by accusing the FBI of hypocrisy on another matter.

***

**Verdict – 95% –** This text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform the reader about the facts of the case, but to persuade them to adopt a specific, predetermined worldview. The author achieves this by employing a very high number of propaganda techniques instead of relying on reasoned argumentation or waiting for conclusive evidence.

The piece immediately frames the narrative with **Name Calling** and **Loaded Language** in the title. It systematically works to destroy the credibility of the official source of information, the FBI, by accusing it of corruption, deception, and willful ignorance (**Doubt**, **Exaggeration**). It presents a **Black & White Fallacy** where the only alternative to the author’s conclusion is institutional corruption.

The author’s argument rests on **Causal Oversimplification**, insisting that the suspect’s presumed religion is the only possible motive, and dismisses the entire investigative process as a waste. This is reinforced with a **Straw Man** of what an investigation entails and an appeal to fear about an ongoing “war.” The use of a **Reduction ad Hitlerum** analogy and **Thought-Terminating Clichés** serves to shut down critical thinking and paint the situation in the most extreme terms possible.

While the text includes a factual news report, it is used merely as a jumping-off point to launch its own highly biased and emotionally driven argument. The overwhelming reliance on these manipulative techniques to promote a specific agenda, rather than engaging in a factual and nuanced discussion, confirms its nature as propaganda.
