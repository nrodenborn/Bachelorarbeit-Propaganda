Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used to attack any subject.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message is stated clearly but not repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed for rallying or persuasion are used (e.g., "Taken all necessary measures" is a descriptive statement, not a slogan).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the topic (Ebola outbreak) is inherently concerning, the text reports facts (cases, deaths, fatality rate) neutrally. It does not explicitly try to instill fear to promote a specific alternative action or idea.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person, organization, or information. It reports confirmed cases and statements from authorities.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The reported figures (2 confirmed cases, 21 suspected cases, 17 deaths, 50% fatality rate) and descriptions ("rare and deadly disease") are presented factually without obvious overstatement or understatement.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity to promote an idea or action.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is largely neutral and descriptive. Terms like "rare and deadly disease" are accurate descriptors for Ebola. There is no obvious use of emotionally charged words or stereotypes to manipulate.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No idea is disapproved of by linking it to hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or action to encourage acceptance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The causes of the outbreak or its spread are not discussed in simplistic terms. The transmission methods are stated factually without implying a single, simple cause for the complex event.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific about the location, numbers, actions being taken, and sources (WHO, DRC government, Dr. Moeti). No unclear or obscure language is used to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While authorities (DRC Government, WHO, Dr. Moeti) are cited, their statements are presented as factual reports of actions being taken ("declared an outbreak", "taken all necessary measures", "gather more samples...") rather than as evidence used to support a specific claim or persuade the audience of an idea's validity. The authority is the source *of the news*, not used to bolster an argument.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents a factual situation (an outbreak has been declared, cases exist, responses are planned). It does not present only two choices or options to the reader.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking or discussion (e.g., "It is what it is," "That's just common sense"). The statements are informative.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the topic of the Ebola outbreak declaration, the situation on the ground, and the planned response. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – No opposing argument is presented, let alone misrepresented or refuted.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – There is no attempt to charge an opponent with hypocrisy or deflect criticism by pointing to others' flaws.

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is overwhelmingly a straightforward, factual news report about the declaration of an Ebola outbreak in the DRC. It presents specific details (location, case numbers, fatality rate, transmission methods) and quotes official sources (DRC government, WHO) regarding the situation and the planned response. The language is neutral and descriptive. None of the listed propaganda techniques are employed to manipulate, persuade, or distort the information. The slight percentage (5%) acknowledges the inherent gravity of the topic (Ebola) which *could* be exploited for propaganda, but this text itself does not cross that line. It functions as an informational update.
