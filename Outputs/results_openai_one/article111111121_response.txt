### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 10% – The text is primarily a factual news report summarizing the events surrounding the firing of Officer Amber Guyger. While it does raise questions about the police department’s actions (doubt) and references authorities (appeal to authority), these are standard journalistic practices rather than clear propaganda techniques. The tone is neutral, and there is no evidence of manipulation, emotional appeals, or misleading arguments. The likelihood of this being propaganda is very low, as the primary intent appears to be informing the public rather than persuading or manipulating opinion.**
