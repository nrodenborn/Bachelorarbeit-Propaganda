### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Muslim jihadis," "Islamists," "jihad compound" (insulting labels for the subjects).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" repeated three times.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "jihad compound" (memorable phrase evoking fear).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "11 other children were being trained to commit jihad in mass school shootings" (instills fear of terrorism).  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "the FBI ignore the intelligence... just like they have in many cases" (questions FBI credibility).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "little jihadis" (exaggerates children's involvement); "And the death of the three-year-old? Nothing!" (minimizes legal actions taken).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No overt appeal to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "jihadis," "terror compound," "coverup," "complicity" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No association with hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to popularity of an idea.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Suggests the child’s death resulted *only* from the FBI’s inaction: "if they had acted, they may have saved the little boy's life."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – "further coverup of what really took place" (vague accusation without specifics).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Authority figures (e.g., Trump) are criticized, not cited as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Implies the only options are full prosecution ("pursue justice") or total failure ("coverup"), ignoring nuances.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "serves no useful purpose" (dismisses criticism without engagement).  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Shifts to Trump/Sessions/Gowdy: "if Trump is going to fire Sessions... put someone... who will do the job faithfully."  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – "their own complicity" (attributes unstated criminal intent to the FBI).  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting opponents.

### Verdict  
**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs **loaded language** ("jihadis," "terror compound") and **name-calling** to dehumanize subjects, uses **fear appeals** (school shootings, child death), and **exaggerates/minimizes** facts to manipulate emotions. It distracts with **red herrings** (Sessions, Gowdy) and **oversimplifies causality** (blaming the FBI solely for the child’s death). The tone is accusatory and dismissive of institutional processes (e.g., mocking the district attorney’s statement), while **straw men** and **obfuscation** imply systemic corruption without evidence. The repetitive poll and inflammatory framing further signal intent to provoke outrage rather than inform. Only the absence of *flag-waving* and *reductio ad Hitlerum* prevents a 100% rating.
