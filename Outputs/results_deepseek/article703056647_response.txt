Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to people/groups. "Black Death" is a historical term for plague.  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "Explode" is repeated 3 times to describe epidemic spread (headline, paragraph 1, paragraph 4).  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used for persuasion.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings like "unleashing the sickness on the globe" and "spread the disease globally" instill fear of uncontrollable pandemic.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility occurs.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "Explode exponentially" exaggerates threat scale; "Black Death" (medieval connotation) amplifies severity. Minimization is absent.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism/identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Unleashing," "deadlier," "fueled by," "balk" evoke alarm/disapproval, especially regarding Famadihana.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association with hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes outbreak spread primarily to Famadihana ("fueled by"), downplaying complex factors like healthcare access/poverty.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are specific (e.g., case numbers, seasonal timing).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites "Officials," "Foreign Office," "health chief," and "aid workers" to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dilemmas presented.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases halting critical thought.

---

**Verdict – 70%** – The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques, primarily **appeal to fear** (emphasizing global catastrophe), **exaggeration** ("explode," "Black Death"), **loaded language** (e.g., "fueled by" for Famadihana), and **causal oversimplification** (blaming cultural rituals). While based on factual elements (case numbers, quotes), its sensational framing, selective focus on Famadihana, and alarmist tone suggest an intent to manipulate emotions rather than neutrally inform. The 70% likelihood reflects moderate propaganda use: it amplifies threat perception but does not fabricate core facts.
