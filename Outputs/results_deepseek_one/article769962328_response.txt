### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits 14/18 propaganda techniques, primarily using **emotional manipulation** (fear, loaded language), **us-vs-them framing** (genuine vs. counterfeit Christians), and **religious/political authority** to promote a divisive worldview. It oversimplifies societal issues, attacks perceived enemies (media, progressive values), and uses repetition/slogans to reinforce ideology. While based in genuine religious perspective, its methods align with propaganda: persuading through one-sided rhetoric, discouraging critical analysis, and polarizing audiences. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the author’s personal narrative but does not outweigh the pervasive propagandistic structure.
