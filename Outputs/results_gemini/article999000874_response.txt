Name calling – Yes – The poll option "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass" directly attacks Jim Acosta with an insulting label.

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times consecutively.

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to promote its own message, though it does quote phrases used by others.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text quotes CNN's statement: "If left unchallenged, the actions of the White house would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials."

Doubt – Yes – The text states, "Acosta can deny how the altercation took place, but the video shows the facts, which are that Acosta was out of line," directly questioning the credibility of Acosta's denial.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text describes Acosta as "forcefully pushing her arm away," which exaggerates the physical contact. It also minimizes the controversy over the video by simply stating it was "sped up."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – Phrases like "act like a child," "argumentative Acosta," and "forcefully pushing" are used to evoke negative emotions towards Jim Acosta.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest an idea is popular with a group hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular and that the reader should join the majority.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests the complex issue of revoking a press pass was simply because "Acosta was out of line," ignoring the broader context of First Amendment rights and the administration's relationship with the press.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its assertions and is not deliberately unclear or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the White House Press Secretary and Counselor to the President to support its claims about Acosta's behavior, and explicitly introduces a section with "Fox News reports:".

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents a false dichotomy in its primary answers: "Yes, he should have gotten it back" versus "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass," framing the choice as either full support for Acosta or agreeing he acted like a child.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "the video shows the facts" is used to end discussion and discourage any alternative interpretation of the events.

Red herring – No – The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main issue.

Straw men – No – The text addresses arguments made directly by Acosta and CNN rather than misrepresenting them.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing the opponent of hypocrisy on another matter.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. While it is structured like a news article and includes factual information (such as the filing of the lawsuit and direct quotes), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to take a side against CNN and Jim Acosta. This is achieved through the heavy use of numerous propaganda techniques. The author employs loaded language ("argumentative Acosta"), name-calling ("act like a child"), and exaggeration ("forcefully pushing") to paint Acosta in a negative light. It casts doubt on his credibility ("Acosta can deny... but the video shows the facts") and uses a thought-terminating cliché to shut down debate. The article also engages in causal oversimplification by reducing a complex First Amendment issue to a simple matter of Acosta being "out of line." The inclusion of a poll with a black & white fallacy and repetitive questioning is a clear tool for engagement and opinion-shaping, not objective reporting. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear and deliberate intent to manipulate the reader's perception of the event, making it a strong example of propaganda.
