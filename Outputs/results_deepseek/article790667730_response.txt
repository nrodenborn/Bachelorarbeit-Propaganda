Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "most unethical sham" (Labeling the Democrats' actions as a sham).
2.  **Repetition – No** – The core message isn't repeated excessively within the text itself (the poll question repetition is separate).
3.  **Slogans – No** – No brief, memorable phrase promoting an idea is used beyond the quoted insults ("unethical sham" is an insult, not a promotional slogan).
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "Boy, I hope you never get it. I hope the American people can see through this sham..." (Instills fear of Democrats gaining power).
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "believing every word of Dr. Christine Ford without any evidence" and "all of the evidence and all of the witnesses... refute her claims" (Questions Ford's credibility and the basis of the allegations).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – "destroy this guy's life", "through hell and then some", "most unethical sham" (Exaggerates the impact on Kavanaugh and the nature of the Democrats' actions).
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – No appeal to patriotism or national identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "berated", "relentless assault", "blasted", "unleashes firestorm", "destroy this guy's life", "unethical sham", "hell" (Uses emotionally charged words to frame the Democrats' actions negatively and Kavanaugh's suffering intensely).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No association with hated groups like Nazis is made.
10. **Bandwagon – Yes** – "he said what many of us thought should have been said", "said what everyone had been waiting on" (Appeals to the idea that Graham represents popular sentiment).
11. **Causal Oversimplification – No** – While motives are attributed ("What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020"), it's presented as their *intended* goal, not necessarily the sole simple cause of a complex event.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The language is direct and accusatory, not vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – No external authority (expert, institution) is cited as support. The text relies on Graham's opinion and the author's perspective.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Portrays the situation as purely malicious Democrats trying to destroy an innocent Kavanaugh ("What you want to do is destroy this guy's life...", "This is the most unethical sham... Boy, y'all want power.") with no nuance.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – While strong accusations are made ("sham", "unethical"), they don't function specifically as clichés designed to shut down discussion within the text itself.
16. **Red herring – No** – The text focuses on the hearing and accusations. The poll question about the UN Ambassador is a separate element, not introduced to distract *within* the narrative about Kavanaugh/Graham.
17. **Straw men – No** – Graham refutes the *motivation* he attributes to Democrats ("destroy this guy's life..."), which is a core part of his accusation, not a misrepresented argument they actually made.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – Graham does not charge the Democrats with hypocrisy by pointing to their own past actions or inconsistencies.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It strongly advocates a specific, highly partisan viewpoint (defending Kavanaugh, condemning Democrats) by employing multiple classic propaganda techniques:
*   **Strong Loaded Language & Name-Calling:** Uses highly negative and emotionally charged terms ("firestorm", "berated", "relentless assault", "blasted", "destroy this guy's life", "unethical sham", "hell") to frame the Democrats' actions as inherently malicious and destructive, and Kavanaugh as a pure victim.
*   **Exaggeration:** Dramatically amplifies the impact on Kavanaugh ("destroy this guy's life", "through hell and then some") and the nature of the Democrats' actions ("most unethical sham").
*   **Appeal to Fear:** Explicitly warns against Democrats gaining power ("Boy, I hope you never get it").
*   **Doubt:** Actively undermines Dr. Ford's credibility and the basis of the allegations against Kavanaugh.
*   **Bandwagon:** Implies Graham's outburst represents the true feelings of "many of us" and "everyone".
*   **Black & White Fallacy:** Presents the situation as a clear-cut case of innocent victim (Kavanaugh) vs. malicious attackers solely motivated by a desire for power (Democrats), eliminating any nuance or legitimate inquiry.
While it reports on an actual event (Graham's speech) and quotes him directly, the author's framing ("right on point", "unleashes firestorm", "finally said what everyone had been waiting on"), the selection of quotes emphasizing outrage and victimhood, and the uncritical endorsement of Graham's perspective clearly aim to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, emotionally charged political stance rather than provide a neutral account. The high concentration of these techniques indicates a strong propaganda intent. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges that it *is* reporting a real event and quotes, but the overwhelming slant makes the propagandistic purpose dominant.
