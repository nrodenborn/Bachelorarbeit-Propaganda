1. Name calling – Yes – A Facebook user is quoted as telling Lynne White, a critic of the program: “You are not a Christian, a Christian is a person who strives to be more Christ like with everything they do and I do not believe Christ would be working to shut this program down or alter it to include your worldly views.” This attacks her identity to invalidate her argument.

2. Repetition – No – While the central conflict is discussed throughout the text, no single propagandistic message or phrase is repeated over and over by a specific source to indoctrinate the reader.

3. Slogans – Yes – A billboard in Princeton is described with the slogan: “If you die tonight. Heaven or Hell?” This is a brief, memorable phrase intended to provoke a strong emotional response.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The plaintiff Elizabeth Deal reports that students who did not attend the class were bullied; for example, other students told her daughter that “she was going to hell.” This is a direct attempt to instill fear.

5. Doubt – Yes – Former school board member Lynne White is quoted writing that “the Bible in the schools program in Mercer County is being sustained on a foundation of lies,” which directly questions the credibility and honesty of the program's leadership.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – A supporter, Courtney Tolliver, minimizes the religious aspect of the class by stating, “It’s not teaching religion, but it teaches character and respect and how important it is to tell the truth.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The lawsuit against the program appeals to American constitutional principles, arguing that the program “violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment.” This is an appeal to a core aspect of American political identity.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The lawsuit, as quoted in the text, uses emotionally charged language by stating the program “improperly entangles public schools in religious affairs, and violates the personal consciences of nonreligious and non-Christian parents and students.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not contain any instances of an idea being disapproved by comparing it to groups like Nazis or other figures/groups widely hated by the audience.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text notes the popularity of the program as a key feature, stating, “The program is not mandatory, but almost every child in the district attends. And there is widespread support for the classes.” This implies that its popularity is a reason it should continue.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – A lesson from the class is quoted: “If all of the Israelites had chosen to follow the Ten Commandments, think of how safe and happy they would have been.” This suggests a simple cause (following the commandments) for a complex outcome (societal safety and happiness).

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The lawyer for the school district is quoted as saying, “our client is very, very flexible in terms of making sure that the content is in compliance with the law.” This is a vague statement that avoids specifying what is currently wrong with the class or what concrete changes will be made.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Supporters of the class cite religious authorities, such as the Rev. David W. Dockery. Opponents cite legal and academic authorities, such as the Supreme Court and Charles C. Haynes, the founding director of the Religious Freedom Center.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – A Facebook commenter tells Lynne White, “You are not a Christian,” for opposing the program. This presents only two options: one is either a supporter of the program or not a true Christian, ignoring any other possibility.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The Rev. David W. Dockery uses a phrase to discourage critical thought by stating, “Any time God’s word can be proclaimed is beneficial and is a good thing.”

16. Red herring – Yes – When former school board member Lynne White presented her arguments against the program, she “heard from some supporters, but many others questioned her faith.” This is a red herring as it distracts from her legal and procedural points by introducing the irrelevant issue of her personal piety.

17. Straw men – Yes – A Facebook user attacks Lynne White by claiming she wants to “alter it to include your worldly views.” This refutes an argument she did not make; her stated position is that the class is unconstitutional during school hours but acceptable as an after-school program.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain an example of a person responding to a criticism by charging their opponent with a different, unrelated form of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 10% – The text itself is a piece of journalism, not propaganda. Its primary purpose appears to be to inform the reader about a complex community conflict and legal challenge, not to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint. Evidence for its journalistic nature includes the balanced presentation of quotes from both supporters and opponents of the Bible class, the inclusion of context about the community, and the reporting on arguments from multiple angles (parents, clergy, lawyers, academics). The article contains numerous examples of propaganda techniques, but these are used by the people being quoted within the story. The article is reporting *on* the use of propaganda by the participants in the conflict, rather than using it to push its own agenda. The low percentage reflects that while any text can have inherent biases, this article's structure and content are overwhelmingly characteristic of objective reporting rather than persuasive propaganda.
