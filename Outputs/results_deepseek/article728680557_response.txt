### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:
1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against opponents or alternatives.  
2. **Repetition** – No – The phrase "Profession of Immutable Truths" appears multiple times but only as a proper noun referring to the document, not as deliberate repetition of a message.  
3. **Slogans** – No – "Profession of Immutable Truths" is a document title, not a brief, memorable phrase designed for mass appeal.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – While societal issues like "divorce plague" and "sexual depravity" are mentioned, they describe problems rather than instilling fear to promote the document.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No direct questioning of credibility (e.g., no attacks on opposing views or institutions).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Terms like "plague" for divorce are descriptive in context; no clear overstatement/understatement of facts.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – Appeals to religious identity are absent; patriotism or national identity are not invoked.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Terms like "sanctity," "indissolubility," "neo-pagan society," "plague," and "sexual depravity" evoke strong moral emotions and stereotypes.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No associations with hated groups (e.g., Nazis) to discredit ideas.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Emphasis on the growing number of signatories ("tenth prelate," "nine bishops and one cardinal") implies legitimacy through popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No claims that the document alone will solve complex societal issues; problems are presented as multifaceted.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – The text clearly explains the document’s purpose (defending marriage doctrine) without vagueness.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Repeated references to bishops/cardinals (e.g., Pope Benedict XVI appointing Fischer) and their titles lend credibility through hierarchy.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dilemmas (e.g., no "support this or reject marriage sanctity" framing).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – The document title is not used to shut down debate; Schneider’s quote invites broader episcopal support.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All content relates directly to the document or marriage; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments; critics of traditional marriage are not mentioned.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy against opponents.  

### Verdict  
**Verdict – 25% –** The text exhibits mild propagandistic elements (loaded language, bandwagon, appeal to authority) but primarily functions as a news report. It cites factual events (signing of a document, bishop appointments) and quotes sources directly. The loaded terms ("neo-pagan society," "plague") and emphasis on authority/endorsements suggest advocacy for a specific viewpoint, yet it avoids overt manipulation like fear-mongering or distortion. The 25% likelihood reflects low-intensity persuasion common in ideological journalism, not systematic propaganda.
