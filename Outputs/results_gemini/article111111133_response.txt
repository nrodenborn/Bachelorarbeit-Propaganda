1. Name calling – No – The text reports on insults being used by others ("Mr. Trump often lobs insults at journalists") but does not use any insulting labels itself.
2. Repetition – No – The text follows a narrative structure, presenting a sequence of events and different viewpoints without repeating a specific message to persuade the reader.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea. It analyzes a statement from the White House as a "behave or else" warning, but this is an interpretation, not a slogan used by the author.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text reports that some view the new rules as an "ominous encroachment" and a "warning," but it attributes these fears to specific groups (like the ACLU and the Correspondents’ Association) rather than instilling fear itself.
5. Doubt – No – The text reports on one party casting doubt on another (e.g., CNN’s lawyers calling the White House's rationale an “after-the-fact concocted process”), but the article itself does not directly question the credibility of any party. It presents the conflicting views.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text uses descriptive but generally factual language. Phrases like "most severe step yet" are presented as journalistic assessments within the context of the events, not as propagandistic hyperbole.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its point.
8. Loaded Language – No – The article reports on the loaded language used by the subjects (e.g., the White House blaming Acosta for being "disrespectful"). The author's own language, such as "testy questions," is descriptive of the tone of the events rather than being primarily aimed at manipulating the reader's emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to hated groups to discredit an idea.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is correct because it is popular. It presents a conflict with multiple differing viewpoints.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text avoids this by providing multiple contributing factors and historical context for the dispute, such as Mr. Trump's general relationship with the press, the specific incident with Mr. Acosta, and comparisons to the Obama administration.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is written clearly and seeks to explain the situation, not obscure it.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text quotes various authorities (a federal judge, the ACLU, the White House Correspondents’ Association) to report their specific viewpoints and actions within the story. This is journalistic sourcing, not the logical fallacy of using an authority's support as the sole evidence for a claim's truth.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present the situation as having only two options. It explores the nuances of the conflict, including legal arguments, historical precedents, and the perspectives of multiple organizations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases designed to discourage critical thought; its purpose is to inform the reader about a complex event.
16. Red herring – No – All the information presented, including the historical context of the Obama administration's press relations, is relevant to the topic of White House press access and conduct.
17. Straw men – No – The text reports on the actual arguments and statements made by the parties involved in the dispute, rather than misrepresenting or inventing arguments to refute.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text itself does not engage in whataboutism. It provides historical context by mentioning press relations under President Obama, but it does so to compare and contrast the situations, not to deflect criticism from the Trump administration. It explicitly notes that the actions against Acosta were more severe.

Verdict – 5% – This text is a piece of journalistic reporting, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about an event, not to persuade them to adopt a specific viewpoint through manipulation. The text demonstrates hallmarks of objective reporting by:
1.  **Attributing information and opinions:** It clearly states who is saying what, quoting the White House, CNN's lawyers, the ACLU, and the White House Correspondents' Association.
2.  **Presenting multiple sides:** It includes the White House's justification for its actions (blaming Acosta, citing professional norms) alongside the criticisms from press freedom groups.
3.  **Providing context:** It places the event in a broader context by mentioning historical precedent with the Obama administration, which serves to inform the reader rather than to deflect blame (whataboutism).

The text does not use any of the listed propaganda techniques. Instead, it reports on a political conflict in which the actors involved (e.g., the White House) may be using such techniques. The very low percentage accounts for the inherent, unavoidable bias in any written work, such as the choice of which quotes to include or the use of descriptive words like "testy," but its structure and intent are clearly informational, not propagandistic.
