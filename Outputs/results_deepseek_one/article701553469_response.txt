Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Mob" is used to negatively label the group that removed the students (e.g., "one of the members of the **mob** that removed the three directors").
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not repeat the exact same phrase or message multiple times for emphasis.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: There are no brief, catchy, memorable phrases used like "Build the Wall" or "I have a dream" within the quoted text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text instills fear about the spread of antisemitism and intolerance, suggesting it starts with Jews and then targets others (e.g., "First they came for the Jews. And then they came for everyone else.") and warns of a "toxic" environment nurtured by the press.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text repeatedly questions the BDS movement's claim of not being antisemitic (e.g., "If BDS is not anti-Semitic, why did a BDS-led campaign name and shame me for my affiliation with a Jewish organization...?").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: The characterization of the McGill Daily's policy as systematically preventing "McGill’s Jewish community from defending itself" potentially exaggerates its impact. Minimization is seen in dismissing the "conflicts of interest" claim against the Jewish students while implying the same wouldn't apply to Muslim students/BDS supporters ("Somehow I don't think being a member of a Muslim student group and supporting BDS would be considered a conflict of interest.").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or a broad group identity (like "We the People") to rally support. It focuses on Jewish identity and antisemitism specifically.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Emotionally charged words like "blatant agenda," "harassment and hate," "intimidate and penalize," "racist boycott movement," "utterly unacceptable," "toxic campus press," "mob," and "absurd attacks" are used throughout to evoke strong negative feelings against the opposing side.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not attempt to link opponents or their ideas to Nazis, Hitler, or the Holocaust. The phrase "First they came for the Jews..." alludes to Nazi persecution but does not explicitly label current opponents as Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not argue that an idea should be accepted because it is popular or gaining support. It focuses on the actions of specific groups (Democratize SSMU, BDS).
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text presents antisemitism at McGill as a complex issue nurtured by multiple factors (specific groups, campus press, administration inaction), not attributing it to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is direct and clear in its accusations and descriptions (e.g., naming groups, individuals, specific actions, policies). It does not use deliberately unclear language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not cite any authority figure (expert, leader, institution) to validate its claims. It relies on quotes from the affected student (Lew), the author's perspective, and references to other students/groups.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text presents the situation as a clear battle between persecuted Jewish students/pro-Israel advocates (good) and the BDS movement/Democratize SSMU/McGill Daily (bad, antisemitic, racist). Nuance or potential valid concerns from the other side are absent (e.g., "All three were targeted for removal either because they are Jewish or have vocally opposed anti-Jewish discrimination on campus.").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not use phrases like "it is what it is" or "that's just the way things are" to shut down discussion. It actively argues its points.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the incident at McGill, the actions of Democratize SSMU/BDS, the role of the McGill Daily, and the issue of antisemitism. It does not introduce significantly irrelevant material.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text portrays the opposition's motives purely as antisemitism ("this was about my Jewish identity, and nothing more"; "because I am Jewish"; "inherent anti-Semitism in the BDS movement"), potentially oversimplifying or misrepresenting the stated reasons given by Democratize SSMU (conflicts of interest related to specific political activism and involvement in passing the BDS ban).
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text charges opponents with hypocrisy by pointing to a hypothetical double standard regarding Muslim/Islamist content (e.g., "we know exactly what the reaction would be if a student paper refused to publish any pro-Islamist content.").

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of recognized propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Black & White Fallacy, Straw Men, Whataboutism). Its primary purpose is not neutral reporting but to persuade the reader of a specific, highly charged viewpoint: that the removal of the Jewish students was unequivocally antisemitic, that the BDS movement is inherently antisemitic, and that McGill University fosters a toxic environment for Jewish students. It achieves this through emotionally loaded language, presenting a stark good-vs-evil narrative, questioning the motives of opponents while dismissing their stated reasons, invoking fear of broader persecution, and highlighting perceived double standards. While based on real events, the selective framing, lack of counter-perspective, and heavy use of persuasive techniques strongly indicate its function as propaganda advocating for a specific political position regarding Israel, BDS, and campus antisemitism. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the underlying factual events but recognizes the dominant persuasive intent and technique usage.
