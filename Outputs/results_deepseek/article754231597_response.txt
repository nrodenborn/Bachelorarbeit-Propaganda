Based on the definitions provided and the text "Ebola Outbreak Confirmed in Democratic Republic of Congo," here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used to attack any subject.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message is stated clearly but not repeated excessively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed for persuasion are used.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While Ebola is described as "deadly" and causes "severe bleeding and organ failure," this is a factual description of the disease. The text does not use this description to instill fear against alternatives or push a specific action beyond standard outbreak response.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The credibility of the government, WHO, or the outbreak itself is not questioned.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The description of Ebola ("deadly virus," "severe bleeding," "organ failure," "unpleasant symptoms") is factual and not exaggerated. The number of cases (2 confirmed) and the historical context (9th outbreak) are reported without minimization.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity to support a viewpoint.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is largely neutral and descriptive. Terms like "deadly" and "unpleasant symptoms" accurately describe Ebola without relying on strong emotional triggers or stereotypes beyond the necessary medical context.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No ideas are disapproved of by linking them to hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or action to encourage adoption.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The outbreak is reported as an event. No complex cause is assumed or oversimplified. The cause (viral infection) is inherent to the news item.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific about the location (Bikoro province), number of cases (5 suspected, 2 confirmed), responders (Government, WHO), and historical context (9th outbreak, last in 2017 Bas Uele). No unclear or obscure expressions are used to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While Dr. Moeti (WHO) is quoted outlining the response plan, her statement is presented as information about actions being taken, not as evidence to support a specific claim or viewpoint. The authority (WHO) is cited appropriately as a key actor in the response.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents the situation (outbreak declared, response planned) without framing choices or options in a simplistic binary way.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used to shut down critical thought or discussion. The text informs and quotes plans for action.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the Ebola outbreak announcement, confirmed cases, planned response, and historical context. The mention of the Marburg virus in the photo caption is irrelevant to the Ebola report but is presented as a caption for an image, not as a deliberate distraction within the main text narrative.
17. **Straw men** – No – No opposing arguments are presented, let alone misrepresented or refuted.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are made against any opponent or group.

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is overwhelmingly a straightforward, factual news report about the confirmation of an Ebola outbreak in the DRC. It provides specific details (location, number of cases, testing results, response plans, historical context) using largely neutral language. The description of Ebola's symptoms, while serious, is accurate and not exaggerated for manipulative effect. The quote from the WHO official describes planned actions, not an argument needing support via propaganda techniques. The only element that could be construed as slightly loaded is the description of Ebola symptoms ("deadly," "severe bleeding," "organ failure," "unpleasant"), but this falls within the bounds of factual reporting about a dangerous disease and does not cross into fear-mongering or emotional manipulation aimed at promoting a specific agenda beyond public health awareness. There is no discernible attempt to persuade the audience towards a specific political or ideological viewpoint using any of the defined propaganda techniques. The 5% acknowledges the inherent seriousness of the topic and the *potential* for such language to evoke a response, but the text itself lacks manipulative intent or technique.
