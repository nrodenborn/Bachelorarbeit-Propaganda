Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These elements suggest a high likelihood of the text being propaganda, as they aim to influence the reader's perception of Ilhan Omar and the political context surrounding her statements. The use of emotionally charged language and the presentation of limited options further indicate an attempt to sway public opinion rather than present a balanced view.
