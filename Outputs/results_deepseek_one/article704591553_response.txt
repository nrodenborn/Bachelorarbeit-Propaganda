### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "BDS provocateurs," "rancid character," "leftist-fascist bigotry," and "bigoted BDS provocateurs" are insulting labels used to attack BDS activists.  
2. **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: No specific phrase or message is repeated persistently throughout the text.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Democratize SSMU" is used as a brief, memorable label for the BDS-aligned movement.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text evokes fear by comparing McGill’s environment to "Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws," implying a descent into violent antisemitism.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The author questions the sincerity of McGill’s investigation by referencing past failed investigations at other schools (e.g., SFSU, CUNY).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggeration is evident in phrases like "suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany," which hyperbolizes campus events. Minimization occurs with Sadikov’s violent tweet dismissed as a "misguided joke."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or collective unity (e.g., "we the people") are present.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Emotionally charged terms like "pernicious campaign of hate," "toxic environment," "malevolent," "ignominious end," and "vitriolic" are used to provoke outrage.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Explanation: Explicitly compares BDS actions to "Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws," invoking Hitler/Nazis to discredit opponents.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: No emphasis on the popularity of anti-BDS views or appeals to join a majority.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Blames the "toxic environment" solely on "BDS agitators," ignoring other potential factors in campus dynamics.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is direct and specific (e.g., naming groups, events, and individuals), with no deliberate confusion.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: No external authorities (experts, institutions) are cited to validate claims; only participant perspectives (e.g., Lew) are used.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents BDS supporters as universally bigoted and antisemitic, while framing victims (Lew, Jewish students) as solely righteous.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: No simplistic phrases (e.g., "it is what it is") are used to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: The focus on Igor Sadikov’s "punch a Zionist" tweet distracts from the core narrative about the board removals.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not misrepresent BDS arguments; it critiques actual events (e.g., targeting Jewish board members).  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., "What about X group?") are directed at BDS supporters.

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs multiple persuasive techniques (e.g., **name-calling**, **loaded language**, **reduction ad Hitlerum**, **exaggeration**, and **causal oversimplification**) to advance a one-sided narrative against BDS activists. The language is emotionally charged and inflammatory (e.g., "pernicious campaign of hate," "Nazi Germany"), framing complex campus politics as a clear battle between "bigoted" aggressors and "victimized" Jewish students. While based on real events (e.g., SSMU board removals), the selective emphasis, omission of BDS perspectives, and sensationalist comparisons reveal a clear intent to delegitimize critics of Israel rather than objectively inform. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges factual elements (e.g., Sadikov’s resignation), but the overwhelming use of manipulative techniques aligns with propaganda.
