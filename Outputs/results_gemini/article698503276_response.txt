1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the nuclear deal as “disastrous” and “phony,” and describes the North Korean regime as “rogue” and “duplicitous.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the words “lie” and “lied” when referring to statements made by John Kerry and the Obama administration regarding the terms of the JCPOA.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not employ brief, memorable phrases to promote its own message; it builds a longer, more detailed argument.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by linking the Iran deal to the situation with North Korea, stating that North Korea “is on the verge of being able to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads” and that President Trump does not want to “make the same mistake with Iran.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire piece is constructed to cast doubt on the credibility of John Kerry, the Obama administration, and the JCPOA itself. For example, it questions the verification process by stating, “the IAEA relies on Iran for self-inspection of certain sites.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes President Trump’s actions by stating, “all that President Trump has done so far is to return the JCPOA to Congress for review,” while simultaneously exaggerating the state of John Kerry’s legacy by titling the piece “Kerry On Edge As Legacy Crumbles.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue in terms of national security and accusing the Obama administration of “lying to the American people,” suggesting a betrayal of the nation.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as “disastrous,” “gall,” “reckless abandonment,” “mess,” and “shamelessly,” to create a strong negative impression of the subject.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text explicitly compares the diplomacy behind the JCPOA to appeasement of a dictator, citing “the infamous Munich Pact signed by British and French Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Edouard Daladier with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler.”

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest its viewpoint is correct because it is popular. It even notes that European allies disagree with its position and argues that they are wrong.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text blames the North Korean nuclear crisis entirely on “years of phony agreements with the rogue regime and so-called ‘strategic patience’,” which is a simple cause for a highly complex geopolitical event.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text’s arguments, while biased, are presented directly and forcefully rather than being deliberately unclear.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from authorities like Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes and Iranian official Ali Akbar Velayati as evidence to support its claims that the deal was misrepresented and that military sites are off-limits to inspectors.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: President Trump’s approach to fix or abandon a “disastrous” deal, or the continuation of a deal that provides Iran “a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state,” ignoring any other possibilities or nuances.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase “kick the can down the road” to summarily dismiss the long-term strategy of the JCPOA and discourage further critical thought about it.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text dedicates significant space to the North Korean situation. While presented as an analogy, it serves as a distraction from the specific terms of the JCPOA by introducing the fear and history of failure associated with a different country and diplomatic effort.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text attacks the idea of “anytime, anywhere” inspections as a broken promise, only to then quote a deal proponent, Ben Rhodes, stating that this maximalist position was never the goal, thereby refuting an exaggerated version of the argument.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – In response to Kerry accusing the Trump administration of “lying to the American people,” the text immediately deflects the charge by stating, “It was the Obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts... The Obama administration lied to the American people.”

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and comprehensive example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint of the JCPOA, John Kerry, and the Obama administration. This is achieved through the systematic and heavy-handed use of a vast majority of the propaganda techniques listed. The piece employs constant name-calling (“disastrous,” “phony”) and loaded language (“gall,” “shamelessly”) to create an emotional, negative tone. It repeatedly accuses its subjects of lying to build a narrative of deception. The argument relies heavily on logical fallacies, including a stark black & white fallacy (Trump’s way vs. nuclear disaster), whataboutism (deflecting accusations of lying), a red herring (the lengthy North Korea discussion), and a direct reduction ad Hitlerum (the Munich Pact comparison). The combination of emotional manipulation, discrediting opponents, and logical fallacies, while avoiding any balanced or nuanced discussion, confirms its nature as a propaganda piece.
