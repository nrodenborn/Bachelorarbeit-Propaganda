### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 85% –**  
The text exhibits **multiple propaganda techniques** with clear intent to shape perception:  
- **Loaded language** and **name-calling** vilify Farrakhan and those defending him.  
- **Doubt**, **straw men**, and **whataboutism** discredit critics (ADL/JTA) and imply racial double standards.  
- **Minimization** downplays Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism, while **reduction ad Hitlerum** amplifies his ties to Nazism.  
- **Repetition** of media "embargo" frames a conspiracy of silence.  
- **Emotional manipulation** (e.g., "whitewash") overshadows factual reporting.  
The text’s goal is to delegitimize Davis, the ADL, and mainstream media while excusing Farrakhan’s extremism—a hallmark of propaganda. The 15% uncertainty stems from partial factual basis (e.g., Farrakhan’s history), but its selective framing and techniques overwhelmingly serve a partisan narrative.
