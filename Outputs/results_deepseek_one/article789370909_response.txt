6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes evidence (e.g., "proof so far is non-existent") while exaggerating opponents’ tactics (e.g., "campaign of no-holds barred character assassination").

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome" dismisses critics as irrational, halting debate.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Shifts focus to Feinstein withholding Ford’s unredacted letter and therapy notes, distracting from the accusations.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents opponents’ stance: Claims they insist Kavanaugh "prove he is not guilty," though critics sought investigation, not reversed burden.  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Compares accusations to the MeToo movement ("exploiting ‘Me Too’") to imply hypocrisy.

### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Use of Propaganda Techniques**: Employs 10/18 techniques (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, doubt, straw men), framing the narrative as a moral battle against malicious actors.  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses charged language ("smears," "haters," "character assassination") to evoke outrage and dismiss opposing views.  
3. **One-Sided Presentation**: Omits counter-evidence (e.g., Ford’s polygraph test, witness testimonies supporting her) while amplifying flaws in accusations.  
4. **Demonization of Opponents**: Labels critics as suffering from "Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome," implying irrational hatred.  
5. **Narrative Over Facts**: Prioritizes a defense of Kavanaugh (e.g., "innocent until proven guilty") while downplaying the seriousness of allegations through selective skepticism.  
6. **Call to Action**: Urges immediate confirmation ("Delay is not an option") and threatens consequences if Ford doesn’t comply.  

**Why not 100%?**  
The text references factual events (e.g., Ford’s therapy notes, Grassley’s accommodations) but uses them to serve a partisan agenda. Its persuasive intent, selective framing, and reliance on emotional appeals outweigh its factual elements, placing it firmly in propagandistic territory.
