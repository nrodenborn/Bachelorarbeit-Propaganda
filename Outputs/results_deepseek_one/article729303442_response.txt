Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to the subject by the author or presented uncritically. Terms like "whitewash" are attributed to sources.
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated persistently throughout the text for propagandistic effect.
3.  **Slogans** – No – The text reports events and statements; it does not employ brief, memorable phrases designed as slogans (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL" is absent).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While Jewish groups express concerns about safety and discrimination, the text reports these concerns without using language designed to instill widespread fear in the audience against alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text presents the report's findings and the criticisms of it, but the author does not directly question the credibility of any specific entity. Criticisms are attributed to sources.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text reports claims of minimization (e.g., the report being called a "whitewash") but presents these as statements from sources (B’nai Brith, Jewish groups) rather than employing exaggeration or minimization itself.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or a specific group identity to persuade the audience.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is largely neutral and reportorial. Emotionally charged words like "outrage," "whitewash," or "hostile atmosphere" are used within quotes attributed to sources, not by the author independently.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally hated groups are made to disapprove of an idea within the text.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of any idea or position to persuade the audience.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The complexity of the motivations behind the vote (political disagreement vs. anti-Semitism) is acknowledged. The report and its critics offer differing interpretations, but neither is presented as an unrealistically simple cause by the author.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text clearly explains the events, the report's findings, and the criticisms. It is not deliberately unclear or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While authorities are cited (Boudreau, Fortier, Jewish groups), the text uses them as sources of information and differing viewpoints within a news report, not as unquestionable proof designed to shut down debate.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents multiple perspectives (the report's conclusion, Lew's experience, Jewish groups' criticism, Fortier's response). It does not frame the situation as having only two possible interpretations or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – The text reports on a complex debate and does not employ phrases designed to discourage critical thought or end discussion. It presents arguments from both sides.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text remains focused on the report, the vote, the controversy surrounding anti-Semitism allegations, and the reactions. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text accurately reports the positions of the Boudreau report and the criticisms leveled against it by Jewish groups. There is no misrepresentation of an argument to make it easier to refute.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No participant in the events or the text itself charges an opponent with hypocrisy as a way to deflect criticism or avoid addressing the core issue.

**Verdict – 10% –** The text is overwhelmingly a standard news report presenting facts, differing viewpoints (the McGill report's findings vs. criticism from Jewish groups), and statements from involved parties regarding a specific campus controversy. It maintains a neutral tone, attributes claims and strong language to sources, and avoids employing the listed propaganda techniques itself. The 10% reflects the inherent nature of reporting on a highly charged topic involving accusations of anti-Semitism and the use of strong terms by quoted sources ("whitewash," "hostile atmosphere"). However, the presentation itself is factual and balanced reporting, not propaganda designed to manipulate the audience towards a specific agenda.
