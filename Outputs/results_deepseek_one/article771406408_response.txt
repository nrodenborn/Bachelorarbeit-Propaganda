Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text "France Gives Muslim Killer of Elderly Jewish Woman a Pass" for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text repeatedly uses the label "Muslim killer" (e.g., "Muslim killer of Elderly Jewish Woman", "her Muslim killer", "twenty something Muslim neighbor", "Muslim man", "Muslim neighbours") in a context clearly intended to associate Islam negatively with the crime and portray the perpetrator primarily through his religion in an insulting way.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "Muslim killer" is repeated multiple times. The phrase "Allahu Akbar" is also repeated (e.g., "The killer had allegedly shouted, 'Allahu Akbar'", "was heard shouting 'Allahu Akbar'", "Kobili Traore chanting Muslim prayers and Koranic verses", "resumed Koranic recitation"). The idea that the authorities are protecting him or giving him a pass is also repeated ("the authorities stonewalled", "the killer gets a pass", "the authorities allowed him to commit the crime", "Now they're letting him get away with it", "the system that keeps on protecting him").
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: While phrases like "Allahu Akbar usually means motive unknown" and "the system that keeps on protecting him is [crazy]" are used, they don't fit the brief, memorable, rallying cry nature of a slogan like "BUILD THE WALL".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text strongly implies that the authorities systematically protect Muslim criminals ("Every other Muslim terrorist or killer... blamed on mental illness", "This just continues the pattern", "the authorities stonewalled", "the killer gets a pass", "the authorities allowed him to commit the crime", "Now they're letting him get away with it", "the system that keeps on protecting him"), instilling fear about institutional bias and the inability of the justice system to protect citizens (specifically Jewish citizens) from such attacks.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text consistently questions the credibility and motives of the authorities ("In the tragic comedy of denial", "authorities are still hunting around for his motiv[e]", "the authorities stonewalled", "But a judge requested a second series of tests...", "This tired farce has dragged on", "for some unclear reason", "Yet the police still failed to... rescue her", "the system that keeps on protecting him is [crazy]").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text minimizes the validity of the psychiatric evaluations and the judicial process, calling it a "tired farce" and implying the finding of unfitness is deliberate protection ("Then they were dropped", "The authorities allowed him to commit the crime. Now they're letting him get away with it", "This tired farce has dragged on", "Sure he was crazy. So crazy he tried to contrive an alibi for his crime. Kobili isn't crazy."). It potentially exaggerates the systemic nature of the issue with "Every other Muslim terrorist or killer...".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not appeal to patriotism or a specific national/group identity to rally support. Its focus is on criticizing authorities and highlighting a perceived injustice against a specific group (Jewish victims).
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text uses highly emotionally charged and prejudicial language throughout: "Muslim killer", "tragic comedy of denial", "stonewalled", "gets a pass", "tired farce", "allowed him to commit the crime", "letting him get away with it", "hit her mercilessly", "vilified his victim", "blood everywhere". This language evokes strong emotions (anger, outrage, disgust) and relies on stereotypes (linking Islam inherently to violence and antisemitism).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not attempt to disapprove of an idea by comparing it or its supporters to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not argue that an idea should be accepted because it is popular. It focuses on a specific case and perceived systemic issue.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text strongly implies the *sole* or primary motive for the murder was religious hatred/antisemitism linked to the perpetrator's Islam ("shouted, 'Allahu Akbar'", "calling Halimi 'Satan'", "vilified his victim as a Jewish person and as 'a Satan'", "known for its anti-Semitism"), while dismissing the judicial finding of mental unfitness as a deliberate "farce" and "pass". It simplifies the complex factors (mental state, legal process, potential biases) down to religious hatred and systemic protection of Muslims.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: While the text criticizes authorities for "unclear reason" and "stonewalling", the text itself is generally direct and clear in its accusations and narrative. It doesn't use deliberately obscure language to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: The text quotes the victim's son and brother, but they are victims/witnesses, not authorities presented as evidence for a claim. It actively *discredits* official authorities (police, judges, psychiatrists).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text presents the situation in stark extremes: either Kobili Traore is a sane Muslim motivated solely by religious hatred who should be punished, or the authorities are corruptly protecting him by inventing mental illness. It dismisses the possibility that the mental health findings could be legitimate or that motives could be complex ("Kobili isn't crazy. But the system that keeps on protecting him is").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Phrases like "This just continues the pattern", "Allahu Akbar usually means motive unknown", "This tired farce has dragged on", and especially "Kobili isn't crazy. But the system that keeps on protecting him is" serve to shut down further critical analysis of the complex legal, psychiatric, or motivational aspects of the case, presenting the conclusion as obvious.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the details of this specific case, the actions of the perpetrator, the response of the authorities, and the perceived systemic issue. It doesn't introduce major irrelevant topics to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text doesn't explicitly set up and refute a weaker or misrepresented version of an opposing argument. It directly attacks the authorities' actions and the judicial/psychiatric findings.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not charge its opponents (the authorities) with hypocrisy by pointing to their other actions or flaws unrelated to the core accusation regarding this specific case.

**Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:**

The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs numerous propaganda techniques heavily and consistently throughout its narrative:

1.  **Strong Agenda & Bias:** The text has a clear agenda: to portray the murder of Sarah Halimi as a clear-cut act of Islamic antisemitism, to accuse French authorities of systematically protecting Muslim perpetrators of violence (especially against Jews), and to discredit the judicial and psychiatric processes that found the perpetrator unfit for trial. This bias permeates every aspect of the retelling.
2.  **Reliance on Loaded Language & Name-Calling:** The constant use of "Muslim killer," "tragic comedy of denial," "stonewalled," "gets a pass," "tired farce," "mercilessly beaten," "vilified," and "blood everywhere" is not neutral reporting. It's designed to evoke outrage, fear, and disgust, firmly associating Islam with violence and the authorities with corruption/incompetence.
3.  **Repetition for Emphasis:** The repeated use of "Muslim killer," "Allahu Akbar," and phrases about authorities protecting the killer reinforces the core negative messages relentlessly.
4.  **Appeal to Fear:** The narrative directly instills fear about the safety of Jewish citizens in France, suggesting authorities are unwilling or unable to protect them from violence motivated by Islamic antisemitism and that the system actively protects the perpetrators.
5.  **Doubt & Discrediting:** The text systematically casts doubt on the motives, competence, and honesty of the police, judges, and psychiatrists involved, framing their actions as deliberate obstruction ("stonewalled," "farce," "unclear reason," "system that keeps on protecting him").
6.  **Oversimplification & Fallacy:** It reduces the complex motivations and legal/psychiatric evaluations to a simple narrative of religious hate crime and systemic cover-up (Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy). It dismisses the mental health findings with sarcasm and a thought-terminating cliché ("Sure he was crazy. So crazy he tried to contrive an alibi... Kobili isn't crazy. But the system... is").
7.  **Selective Framing & Omission:** While based on real events, the text frames every detail to support its agenda. It emphasizes the religious aspects (chants, alleged statements) and police inaction/decision-making during the event, while downplaying or dismissing the psychiatric evaluations and judicial processes that followed. The tone and language choices leave no room for alternative interpretations or complexities.

While the underlying event (the murder of Sarah Halimi) was real and involved deeply troubling elements (antisemitic slurs, police response delays, a controversial psychiatric ruling), the *presentation* of this text is not objective reporting. It is a highly manipulative piece designed to provoke strong negative emotions (primarily anger and fear) against Muslims and the French authorities, using a constellation of propaganda techniques to advance a specific, prejudiced viewpoint. The sheer density and consistency of these techniques make the text overwhelmingly propagandistic. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the factual core of the tragic event, but the framing and rhetoric push it firmly into the realm of propaganda.
