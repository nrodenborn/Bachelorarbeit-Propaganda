### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Selective Framing**: Opens by linking Linda Sarsour (a polarizing figure) to unrelated crimes (WTC bombing/school shootings), implying guilt by association without evidence.  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses fear-loaded language ("school shooting plot," "assault rifles," "human remains") and inflammatory labels ("worst of the worst") to provoke outrage.  
3. **Distraction Tactics**: The poll repetition and red herrings (Sarsour/WTC) divert attention from the lack of substantiated claims about the New Mexico case.  
4. **Oversimplification**: Reduces complex issues (terrorism, child abuse) to simplistic narratives tied to Muslim identity, ignoring nuances.  
5. **Source Bias**: Presents allegations as facts (e.g., "training children for school shootings") while omitting counter-evidence (e.g., Wahhaj was never charged in the WTC case).  
6. **Structural Propaganda**: The poll’s repetition and call-to-action ("take our poll") serve to engage readers emotionally while masquerading as news.  

**Why not 100%?**  
The text includes factual elements (e.g., court documents, arrests), but these are weaponized to advance a biased narrative. The overwhelming use of multiple propaganda techniques confirms its intent to manipulate rather than inform.
