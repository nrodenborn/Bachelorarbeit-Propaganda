Verdict – 30% – The text contains elements of propaganda, particularly through the use of appeal to fear and loaded language. These techniques are used to evoke emotional reactions and potentially influence the audience's perception of racial dynamics in the context of the incident. However, the text does not heavily rely on a wide range of propaganda techniques, and much of the content is factual reporting of the incident. Therefore, while there are elements of propaganda, the likelihood of the text being primarily propaganda is moderate.
