1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly refers to Judge Patti Saris and Judge Mark Goldsmith as “Kritarchs,” an invented and insulting label. It also refers to a lawyer as part of the “Treason Bar.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The term “Kritarch” is used 8 times to refer to the judges. The core message that the judges are acting outside their legal authority is also repeated throughout the text in various forms.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text concludes by labeling the judges’ actions as part of the “#Resistance,” using a political hashtag as a slogan to frame their work as illegitimate.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text mentions the potential release of “hundreds of illegal immigrants from Iraq into the community,” including “criminal aliens,” which is intended to instill fear about public safety.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire piece is designed to cast doubt on the credibility and authority of the judges, stating, “Kritarch Saris thinks that her feelings about a deportation are the same as the law” and “Even the illegal aliens know that minor kritarchs have no authority over deportations.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the judges' actions, claiming they want an “unlimited number of hearings” and are creating a “whole new second immigration appeals system.” It also minimizes their legal status by calling them “minor kritarchs.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The title, “America's Immigration Voice,” and the framing of the issue as a defense of the “lawful immigration policies of President Trump” against an internal “#Resistance” is an appeal to patriotism and national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like “Kritarch,” “Treason Bar,” “illegal aliens,” and “absconding,” which are chosen to create a negative impression.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. It instead frames the judges as a rogue minority acting against the law.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the judges' complex legal rulings to a simple, illegitimate cause: their personal feelings and political opposition. For example: “Saris like many other Federal judges does not like our current immigration system and wants another system more to her liking.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; its arguments and attacks are very direct and clear.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly appeals to the authority of the “Executive Branch” and “Federal law” as absolute and unchallengeable, stating, “Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: the absolute and lawful authority of the Executive Branch to deport, or the “illegal and unconstitutional” actions of the judges. It completely ignores the legitimate constitutional role of judicial review.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The statement, “Illegal aliens get only one hearing and one set of appeals to deportation,” is presented as an absolute and final truth to shut down any nuanced discussion of due process or changing country conditions.
16. Red herring – Yes – While the main focus is on Judge Saris and Indonesian immigrants, the text introduces the case of Judge Goldsmith and Iraqi immigrants to distract from the specifics of the Saris case and lump them together as part of a broader conspiracy (“#Resistance”).
17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an argument the judges did not make, claiming Saris wants an “unlimited number of hearings.” The quoted news report shows her actual concern was to prevent deportation *before* existing administrative appeals could be completed, which is not the same as creating an unlimited system.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy. It maintains a direct, sustained attack on its targets.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. It employs a vast majority (14 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques in a coordinated and aggressive manner. The piece is not a reasoned argument but a polemic designed to bypass critical thought and provoke an emotional reaction against the judiciary. The consistent use of name-calling (“Kritarch,” “Treason Bar”), loaded language, and repetition serves to dehumanize and delegitimize the judges. It builds a straw man argument by exaggerating their rulings into a desire for “unlimited” appeals, and then attacks this fabricated position. It uses a black-and-white fallacy by presenting a false choice between absolute executive power and illegal judicial activism, completely ignoring the constitutional principle of checks and balances. The entire text is structured to lead the reader to a single, predetermined conclusion: that these judges are enemies of the state acting illegally based on personal feelings, and that their authority must be eliminated. This is the primary function of propaganda.
