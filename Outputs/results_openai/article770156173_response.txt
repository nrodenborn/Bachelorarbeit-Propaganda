**Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, black & white fallacy, and whataboutism. These techniques suggest a high likelihood that the text is intended to persuade or influence the audience's perception of the US-North Korea situation, particularly in a way that is critical of US policy and leadership. However, the text also provides factual information and analysis, which tempers the overall likelihood of it being pure propaganda.**
