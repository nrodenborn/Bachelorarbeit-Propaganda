1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes a staffer describing Gillum's base as "part of the crazy, crazy, crazies" and the author refers to the staffer as a "useful idiot."

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated three times consecutively.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not employ brief, memorable phrases as a primary method of persuasion.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear by claiming Gillum "does not support the right to keep and bear arms, but rather considers Americans as criminals who need to prove their innocence before obtaining a gun."

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to create doubt about Andrew Gillum's honesty and intentions, using the staffer's quote, “None of the programs that people are hoping for would happen,” as its central piece of evidence.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates a conclusion by stating, "one can then conclude that Gillum knows about Smith's racism and keeps him on staff anyway," presenting a speculative leap as a definite fact.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national identity by focusing on the "right to keep and bear arms" and by including a poll about using "military force" to protect the "U.S. border."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "George Soros-backed," "racist, anti-semite," "cracker state," and "crazy, crazy, crazies" to provoke an emotional response rather than a rational one.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not associate Andrew Gillum or his ideas with Hitler or the Nazi party.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple reason for a complex situation by concluding that Gillum must be aware of and complicit in his staffer's alleged racism simply because the staffer works on his campaign.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article's claims, while biased, are presented directly and are not intentionally vague or obscure.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents Project Veritas and its founder James O'Keefe as credible, authoritative sources for uncovering truth, using their "undercover video" as the primary evidence for all its claims.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll on the migrant caravan presents only two extreme options: "Yes, military force should be used" or "No, keep the military out of it," ignoring a wide spectrum of other possible responses.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "Good luck with that!" is used to dismissively shut down the topic of the campaign appealing to "white guilt," discouraging further thought.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text inserts a poll about a "caravan of migrants," an issue completely unrelated to the topic of Andrew Gillum's staffer, to distract the reader.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents Gillum's likely position on gun control by claiming he "considers Americans as criminals who need to prove their innocence before obtaining a gun," refuting an extreme argument he likely never made.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – When mentioning that Gillum accused his opponent of racism, the text immediately pivots by saying, "...but the video demonstrates the utter racism of Smith," deflecting the original accusation by charging Gillum's side with hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and deliberate piece of propaganda. Its purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of Andrew Gillum by employing a high density of propaganda techniques. The article is framed around evidence from a known political activist organization (Project Veritas) and uses that as a basis to launch a multi-faceted attack. It heavily relies on emotional manipulation through Loaded Language, Name Calling, and Appeal to Fear. It uses logical fallacies like Straw Men, Causal Oversimplification, and Whataboutism to distort reality and attack its target. Furthermore, it uses diversionary tactics, most blatantly the Red Herring of the migrant caravan poll, to introduce unrelated but emotionally charged topics. The sheer volume and combination of these techniques, woven into the fabric of the article, confirm that its primary intent is manipulation, not objective reporting.
