### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "global elite," "Deep State," "corporatocracy" (used pejoratively to label opponents).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated use of "independent media," "censorship," "consciousness," and "Deep State."  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "We don’t need fact checkers, we ourselves should be those fact checkers!"  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings of "total dictatorship," "Orwellian state," loss of freedoms, and erasure of independent voices.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions mainstream media credibility: "what they see coming from the mainstream is usually highly suspect."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates scale of censorship ("hundreds, if not thousands") and power of elites ("drenched with so much power"). Minimizes Trump's controversies ("not because he allegedly is/was racist/sexist").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to democratic ideals: "free and open society," "we the people," "traditions" of the nation.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Vilified," "Orwellian," "corruption," "deceit," "stranglehold," "drenched with power."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No direct Nazi/Vichy comparisons.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Implies a growing mass awakening: "More and more people see it this way," "global mass is growing."  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames media shutdowns solely on "elite preserving control" and "Deep State," ignoring complex factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Vague terms like "Deep State," "consciousness," "shift," "critical mass," "power grid" (metaphorical).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Quotes JFK, Edward Snowden, Einstein, and Senator William Jenner to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents binary: Independent media (truthful) vs. mainstream media/corporatocracy (corrupt). Asserts only two choices: "censorship" or "more speech."  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Consciousness continues to shift," "critical thinking matters," "awakening" (used to dismiss counterarguments).  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Irrelevant mention of cell phone towers/GMO labeling distracts from media censorship focus.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Misrepresents fact-checking as "letting authority figures decide" instead of verifying accuracy.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Defends alternative media by citing Clinton/Podesta’s past use of Wikileaks: "Clinton’s and John Podesta have even referenced Wikileaks before that became ‘fake.’"

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 90% –** The text extensively employs propaganda techniques to advance a specific narrative. It frames "independent media" as heroic truth-tellers and "mainstream media"/government as corrupt tools of a shadowy "Deep State." Loaded language, fear appeals, and oversimplified causality (e.g., blaming elites for all censorship) dominate the piece. Quotes from figures like JFK and Snowden lend false authority, while slogans ("We don’t need fact checkers") and thought-terminating clichés ("consciousness shift") discourage critical scrutiny. The consistent "us vs. them" dichotomy, vilification of opponents, and reliance on emotional manipulation over balanced evidence confirm its propagandistic intent. While it raises valid concerns about media monopolies, the presentation prioritizes persuasion over objectivity.
