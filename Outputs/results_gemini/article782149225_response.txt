Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Said Khecharem referring to the “filthy Jewish entity.”

Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – Yes – The text reports that the audience chanted “Allahu akbar,” which is used here as a brief, memorable phrase to signal approval and solidarity.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The article is built around instilling fear of a widespread, violent Islamic conquest, citing calls for the “conquest of America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy” and the “elimination of the filthy Jewish entity” to persuade the reader that a significant threat is being ignored.

Doubt – Yes – The author actively casts doubt on the mainstream narrative that extremists are a “tiny minority,” stating, “These weren’t the actions of a ‘tiny minority of extremists.’” He also questions the sincerity of Western Islamic groups' condemnations of terror.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author makes the exaggerated claim that “there has never been in Islamic history an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad,” which minimizes or erases centuries of diverse Islamic theological and political history to present a monolithic, aggressive version of the faith.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text explicitly lists Western nations (“America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”) as targets for conquest, appealing directly to the national identity and patriotism of readers from those countries.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases such as “filthy Jewish entity,” “deluded fanatic raving,” “relentless jihad warfare,” and “distressingly widespread” to evoke an emotional response rather than a rational one.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to the Nazis or other groups specifically hated by the target audience to discredit them.

Bandwagon – No – The author argues that his viewpoint is unpopular and largely ignored, rather than suggesting the reader should adopt it because it is already popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author simplifies the complex, multi-faceted history of various Islamic caliphates and states over 1,400 years by attributing their actions almost solely to a single cause: “relentless jihad warfare against non-Muslims.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s argument is direct and clear, not intentionally vague or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites himself and his own book, “The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS,” as an authoritative source on the topic. He also cites the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) to lend credibility to his information.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy where Islam is either a religion of mainstream, normative jihad (the author's position) or a peaceful religion hijacked by a "tiny minority of extremists" (the position he refutes), ignoring the vast spectrum of beliefs and interpretations in between.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The article does not use clichés to shut down debate; rather, it seeks to provoke a specific line of thought.

Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of a poll about Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation is completely irrelevant to the article's content about Islamic extremism and serves as a distraction.

Straw men – Yes – The author sets up and refutes a simplified version of an opposing argument: that extremists are just a “‘tiny minority of extremists,’ abhorred by the vast majority of peaceful Muslims for ‘hijacking’ their religion.” By presenting this simplified caricature, he can more easily dismiss all counter-arguments to his thesis.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text uses whataboutism to charge opponents with hypocrisy, stating: “If Said Khecharem were a non-Muslim saying that Muslims needed to destroy ‘the filthy Jewish entity’... he would be accused of ‘Islamophobia’ and ‘bigotry.’ But no one will take any particular notice of this.” This deflects from the substance of the issue to the perceived hypocrisy of others.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to objectively inform the reader about a specific event, but to persuade the reader to adopt a particular worldview. This is achieved through the heavy and combined use of numerous propaganda techniques.

The article masterfully employs an **Appeal to Fear** by highlighting the most extreme statements of a radical spokesman and presenting them as a direct threat to the reader's home country (**Flag-Waving**). It uses emotionally **Loaded Language** ("filthy," "relentless") to provoke anger and fear.

The author constructs his argument using logical fallacies. He creates a **Straw Man** (the "tiny minority" argument) and a **Black & White Fallacy** (either his view of Islam is correct or the "tiny minority" view is), which he then easily refutes. He uses **Causal Oversimplification** and **Exaggeration** to present 1,400 years of complex Islamic history as a single, monolithic story of "relentless jihad."

To bolster his claims, he uses an **Appeal to Authority** by citing his own work, positioning himself as an expert. He also uses **Whataboutism** to preemptively accuse critics of hypocrisy and **Doubt** to undermine the credibility of mainstream narratives and moderate Muslim voices. The presence of a completely unrelated **Red Herring** (the Kavanaugh poll) further underscores that the page's intent is not purely informational. The sheer density and strategic combination of these techniques indicate a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's perception and emotions, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
