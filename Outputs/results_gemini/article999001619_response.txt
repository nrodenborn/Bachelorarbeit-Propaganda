Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text labels subjects with insulting terms, such as calling Paul Manafort "disgraced" and referring to the "rapacious financial industries."

Repetition – Yes – The central message that the Guardian is engaged in a "vilification" or "attack" on Julian Assange is repeated throughout the text in various forms.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses memorable phrases that encapsulate its arguments, such as the subheading "A pattern, not an aberration" to describe the Guardian's behaviour.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns of dire consequences, stating that the Guardian's article will "pave the way for the US legal system to lock Assange up for a very long time" and that the "neoliberal order... is hurtling us towards climate breakdown and economic collapse."

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is an exercise in casting doubt on the credibility of the Guardian, stating its story is "so full of holes that even hardened opponents of Assange... are struggling to stand by it."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration, for example, by describing the attack on Iraq as "the largest crime against humanity in living memory" and the attacks on Jeremy Corbyn as "relentless, and unhinged."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific political identity, framing the conflict as one between a corrupt "corporate media and political elites" and heroes of the "dissident left" like Assange and Corbyn.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as "vilification," "unhinged," "venom," and "rapacious," to create a negative impression of its targets.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare its opponents to Nazis or similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests a growing consensus against the Guardian's story, stating that "even hardened opponents of Assange in the corporate media are struggling to stand by it."

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the Guardian's varied editorial positions on Assange, Corbyn, and Clinton to a single, simple cause: that its job is to "shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing, neoliberal order."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the opinions of figures like Glenn Greenwald, "Former British ambassador Craig Murray," and a "United Nations panel of experts" as evidence for its arguments.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a world of two opposing sides: the corrupt "neoliberal order" and its "corporate media" on one side, and righteous challengers like Assange and Corbyn on the other, with no room for nuance.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases to shut down discussion; rather, it promotes its own line of argument.

Red herring – Yes – To bolster its argument about the Guardian's motives regarding Assange, the text introduces extensive discussions about its coverage of Jeremy Corbyn, Tony Blair, and Venezuela, which are tangential to the specific Manafort story.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes simpler explanations for the Guardian's actions, such as "personal hatred" or "clickbait tendencies" (attributed to Greenwald), in order to make its own "deeper malaise" argument seem more compelling.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text accuses the Guardian of hypocrisy by pointing out that it has been "vocal in the so-called 'fake news' hysteria" while, in the author's view, publishing fake news itself.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is an extremely strong example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to present a balanced view but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly critical ideological position regarding The Guardian and a supportive one of Julian Assange. It employs a vast majority of the propaganda techniques listed, weaving them together to create a powerful but one-sided narrative. The use of loaded language, name-calling, and appeal to fear creates a strong emotional response, while the constant casting of doubt on the target (The Guardian) undermines its credibility. The text constructs a black-and-white world of corrupt elites versus righteous dissidents (black & white fallacy, flag-waving) and attributes all of the target's actions to a single, sinister motive (causal oversimplification). It uses the opinions of allied authorities to bolster its case while introducing red herrings (Corbyn, Blair) to paint a broader picture of institutional corruption. While the claims made in the article may or may not be factually correct, the method of argumentation is almost entirely propagandistic, designed to rally a base and discredit an opponent by any means necessary rather than engage in a nuanced debate.
