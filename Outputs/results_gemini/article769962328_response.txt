1. Name calling – Yes – The author attacks those who disagree with him by labeling them with insulting terms such as “counterfeits,” “reprobates and hypocrites,” “paper tigers,” and “enemies of the cross of Christ.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is repeated three times in a row. The central theme of “genuine” versus “counterfeit” Christians is also repeated throughout the text in various forms.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases to frame its ideas, such as the title “Soldiers of the Cross” and the description of opponents as “paper tigers.”
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that failing to confront issues like abortion and homosexuality will lead to the loss of the country and one's soul, framing alternatives to the author's path as siding with evil. For example, it describes a "lawlessness-taking place in this country."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built around questioning the credibility of other leaders and the media, labeling them as “counterfeits” and suggesting they are not true to their faith. For example: “You do not see any warfare or opposition around them and why? because they have simply forsaken the cross.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates by claiming homosexuality “is a felony in every state in our union,” which is a false statement. He also minimizes the complexity of his conflicts, framing them simply as the world hating him for being righteous.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by mentioning “re-enforcing America’s value’s by teaching the US Constitution” and framing the conflict as a fight for “saving their country.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language to influence the audience, such as describing abortion as millions of babies being “murdered” and homosexuality as an “abomination.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with groups like Nazis or Hitler to discredit it.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does the opposite of a bandwagon appeal, arguing that being in the minority and facing opposition from the world is a sign of being genuine and righteous.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author simplifies complex issues by attributing a single cause. For example, he claims the sole reason his family and the media attack him is because he started to “emulate (obey) Jesus Christ,” ignoring any other potential factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text is vague about the specific identity of the “counterfeits” and “paper tigers,” referring to them as “some sort of church or political leader” or “a group of people out there.” This allows the reader to apply the labels to any group they choose.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author frequently cites the Bible (e.g., “John 14:6,” “Leviticus 18:22”), as well as religious figures like John Calvin and Catherine Booth, to support his arguments.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark dichotomy with no middle ground: people are either “genuine” Christians who are fighting and being attacked, or they are “counterfeits” and “enemies of the cross.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that discourage critical thought, such as, “After all you can always tell what a man stands for by the enemies that he has,” which is presented as a simple, unchallengeable truth.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation is inserted into the middle of the article. It is completely irrelevant to the author’s argument about identifying “genuine” Christians and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author creates a caricature of his opponents, claiming they are “people pleasers” who believe change can be demanded “just as long as it does not offend anyone.” This misrepresents their position to make it easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – When confronted by his mother about his change in behavior, the author deflects the concern by charging his family with hypocrisy: “when I was in the rock n roll world doing the things that I was doing, nobody said anything.” This avoids addressing the actual question by pointing to perceived hypocrisy.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and comprehensive example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to engage in reasoned debate but to persuade the audience through a barrage of emotional and manipulative techniques. The article systematically employs 16 of the 18 listed techniques to construct a rigid "us vs. them" worldview. It divides the world into two simple categories: the righteous "Soldiers of the Cross" (the author and his followers) and the wicked "counterfeits," "hypocrites," and "enemies" (everyone else). This is achieved through constant Name-calling, Loaded Language ("murdered," "abomination"), and a stark Black & White Fallacy. The author's position is bolstered by Appeals to Authority (the Bible, historical figures) to give it unchallengeable weight, while opposing views are dismissed using Straw Men, Doubt, and Whataboutism. The entire piece is designed to evoke strong emotions (fear, patriotism, righteous anger) and shut down critical thought, thereby solidifying the beliefs of an in-group and demonizing all out-groups. This is the fundamental goal of propaganda.
