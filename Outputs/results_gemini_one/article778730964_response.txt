Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The author labels the imam's claims as "'war is deceit' action" and dismisses him with the label "Ever the victim."
2.  Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times in a row.
3.  Slogans – No – While there are memorable phrases, none function as a distinct, repeated slogan meant to rally support for a cause in the way defined.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text links the subjects to severe threats by stating the son was "training school shooters" and that the mosque "attracted radicals over the years, including a man who later helped bomb the World Trade Center in 1993."
5.  Doubt – Yes – The author directly questions the imam's motives and credibility by stating, "But the imam Siraj Wahhaj is here engaging in some 'war is deceit' action."
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The mosque representative is quoted attempting to minimize the situation by calling it "a domestic situation that has nothing to do with extremism," while the author's framing focuses exclusively on the most alarming aspects of the case.
7.  Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases such as "smear," "jihad activity," "filthy, makeshift compound," and "radicals" to influence the reader's perception.
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular or that the reader should agree because many others do.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text quotes the imam's claim that the reason for the media coverage is simply because reporters "Hate Islam," which oversimplifies a complex criminal investigation into a single cause of religious bias.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and makes its points clearly, without using intentionally vague or confusing language.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the "Associated Press" and mentions claims by "prosecutors" to lend credibility to the information presented. The final line, "Article posted with permission from Robert Spencer," also functions as an appeal to authority for the author's audience.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The author frames the narrative as a choice between believing the imam's "deceit" and accepting the author's narrative of a jihadist threat, leaving little room for nuance or alternative interpretations of the events.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "Ever the victim" is used to dismiss the imam's claims without substantive argument, discouraging further thought on his perspective.
16. Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of a poll about Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation is completely unrelated to the article's topic and serves as a distraction from the main content.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author criticizes the "establishment media" for being "solicitous" of the imam, implying they are defending him, but then uses an AP report that includes incriminating details about the mosque, thus attacking a weaker version of the media's position.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The author accuses the media of hypocrisy by stating they give a platform to the imam but would not do the same for "those whom they smear as 'anti-Muslim' to allow us to tell our side of the story."

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint towards the subjects (the imam, his son, and Muslims associated with the mosque) and the "establishment media." The piece achieves this by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. It begins with whataboutism and name-calling to frame the media as hypocritical and the imam as deceptive. It uses loaded language ("jihad," "radicals") and appeals to fear ("training school shooters," "bomb the World Trade Center") to create an emotional response of fear and anger. The author presents a black & white fallacy where the only alternative to their narrative is to believe a liar. The piece uses logical fallacies like the straw man to misrepresent the media's position and a thought-terminating cliché ("Ever the victim") to shut down critical thought. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Kavanaugh poll) further underscores its manipulative nature. While it uses an excerpt from a legitimate news source (AP), it is framed and contextualized in a way that serves the author's persuasive and ideological goal, rather than objective reporting.
