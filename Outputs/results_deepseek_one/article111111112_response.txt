---

**Verdict – 40%** – The text reports a factual event (bloggers banned) with balanced quotes from multiple perspectives (government, banned individuals, EDL, activists). However, it employs several propaganda techniques—particularly **loaded language** (e.g., "hate preachers"), **appeal to fear** (warning of "inter-community violence"), and **whataboutism** (Robinson’s deflection)—primarily through quoted statements. The core reporting remains neutral, but the selective inclusion of emotionally charged quotes leans toward framing the ban as a clash between "shared values" and "extremism." This creates mild propagandistic framing without being overtly manipulative.
