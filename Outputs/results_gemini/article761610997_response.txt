1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to supporters of free trade as belonging to a "free trade cult" and calls them "free trade zealots," which are insulting labels. It also refers to historical economists as "18th- and 19th-century scribblers."
2. Repetition – Yes – The core idea that the old "Bush-Boehner" Republican party is dead, finished, or obsolete is repeated throughout the text in various forms, such as it being "comatose," "as dead today as was Harding-Coolidge Republicanism," and "its time has come and gone."
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses well-known political slogans like "America First" and "Mission Accomplished" to frame its arguments and define political eras.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that the policies of the old GOP led to dire consequences, such as "denuding America of tens of thousands of factories and millions of manufacturing jobs" and enriching an "adversary nation" (China) whom "we may have to fight."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text explicitly questions the credibility of experts by stating, "'Trade deficits do not matter,' we hear from the economists. They might explain that to Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by describing the old GOP as "comatose" and the effect of trade as "denuding America" of its manufacturing base. It minimizes the contributions of allies by claiming they "ride virtually free" on America's defense spending.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The entire piece is built around an "America First" framework, appealing to patriotism by contrasting policies that benefit America ("at America's expense") with those that supposedly do not.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as "swamp," "cult," "zealots," and "repudiated," instead of more neutral terminology.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other groups widely hated by the target audience to discredit an idea.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The central argument is that because Trump won the election and his platform was chosen by the voters, it is now the inevitable and correct future for the party. The text states Trump "captured the Republican nomination and won the presidency—by saying goodbye to all that," implying the popularity of the ideas makes them right.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue by blaming free trade agreements almost exclusively for the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs, stating China was "denuding America of tens of thousands of factories and millions of manufacturing jobs" as a direct result of trade surpluses.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's points are direct and clearly stated. While the arguments may be one-sided, they are not intentionally obscured or made difficult to understand.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article begins by quoting a figure of authority, former Speaker John Boehner, to immediately validate its central premise: "'There is no Republican Party. There's a Trump party,' John Boehner told a... gathering."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the future of the Republican party as a binary choice between the old "Bush-Boehner" platform and the new "Trumpism," asking, "And if Trumpism is not the future of the GOP, it is hard to see what a promising GOP agenda might look like."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like "We are in a new world now" and "for its time has come and gone" to shut down further debate and dismiss any potential value in the old platform.
16. Red herring – No – The author remains focused on the central argument about the transformation of the Republican party and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the audience.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a distorted version of the "Bush-Boehner GOP" platform by claiming it was "dedicated to... open borders," which is a caricature of their more nuanced position on immigration, making it easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy; it maintains a direct critique of the subject.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a balanced political analysis but a persuasive essay that employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to advance a specific ideological viewpoint. The author systematically constructs a narrative by creating a villain (the "Bush-Boehner GOP") using name-calling ("cult," "zealots"), loaded language ("swamp"), and straw man arguments ("open borders"). It then presents a hero ("Trumpism") and its associated "America First" platform, using flag-waving and a bandwagon appeal based on the 2016 election results. The argument is built on a black & white fallacy, presenting only two options for the party's future, and relies on appeals to fear regarding economic decline and national security threats. It actively seeks to discredit opposing views and expertise through doubt and causal oversimplification. The sheer density and combination of these techniques indicate the primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific political conclusion, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
