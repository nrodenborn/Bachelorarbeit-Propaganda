1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses numerous insulting labels to attack those it disagrees with, such as "revisionists and propagandists," "reprobates and hypocrites," "counterfeits, self-proclaimed leaders," "people pleasers," and "paper tigers."

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times in a row. The core idea of "genuine" versus "counterfeit" Christians is also repeated throughout the text in various forms.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text opens with a quote used as a slogan to frame the article: “If you want to change the future you are going to have to trouble the present.” The title itself, "Soldiers of the Cross," functions as a slogan for the author's in-group.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text appeals to the fear of societal and moral decay by stating the need to "reverse the lawlessness-taking place in this country," implying a dangerous outcome if the author's path is not followed.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built on casting doubt on the credibility and motives of other leaders. For example: "I told her that there are too many counterfeits, self-proclaimed leaders, out there who care more about saving face, than they do the souls of men."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text makes a significant factual exaggeration by claiming homosexuality is "a felony in every state in our union." This is false, as the Supreme Court case *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003) invalidated such laws nationwide.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by linking its actions to national values, stating, "We got kicked out of a public school for re-enforcing America’s value’s by teaching the US Constitution."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to frame issues and provoke a strong reaction. For example: "We have shown the young people that abortion is murder and that 58 million babies have been murdered since 1973 under the guise of woman’s choice."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text attacks its opponents but does not compare them or their ideas to Hitler or the Nazis.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text uses an inverse-bandwagon or elitist appeal, arguing that being unpopular and persecuted is the sign of being correct, while those who are popular are "counterfeits."

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text provides a simplistic cause for a complex situation: "Yet, you do not see any warfare or opposition around them and why? because they have simply forsaken the cross."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague phrasing that allows the reader to fill in their own negative assumptions, such as "when I was in the rock n roll world doing the things that I was doing, nobody said anything..."

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly cites the Bible (e.g., John 14:6, Romans 1:16, etc.) and religious figures like William Booth, Catherine Booth, and John Calvin as ultimate proof of its arguments.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The entire article is framed as a binary choice between two absolute options: being a "genuine" Christian who is in a "continuous warfare" or a "counterfeit" who has "compromised" with the world.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a cliché to shut down nuanced thought: "After all you can always tell what a man stands for by the enemies that he has."

16. Red herring – Yes – The text inserts a poll about Brett Kavanaugh that is completely irrelevant to the surrounding narrative about the author's personal experiences, serving as a distraction.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes a caricatured version of his opponents' position, claiming they believe in "demanding a lawful change just as long as it does not offend anyone," which is an oversimplification of a moderate stance that is easy to attack.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The author attacks his opponents by accusing them of hypocrisy, a form of whataboutism: "The reason they don't [confront issues] is because they are guilty of what they fail to confront!"

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or engage in reasoned debate, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, combative worldview by employing a wide array of manipulative techniques. The article uses 16 of the 18 listed propaganda methods.

The core strategy is to create a stark "us vs. them" dichotomy. It establishes the "in-group" ("Soldiers of the Cross," "genuine Christians") by using Flag-Waving (linking their cause to America) and Appeal to Authority (the Bible, revered religious figures).

Simultaneously, it aggressively demonizes the "out-group" ("counterfeits," "the world," "propagandists") through persistent Name-calling, Loaded Language ("murder," "abomination"), and by casting Doubt on their motives. The worldview presented is deliberately simplistic, relying heavily on the Black & White Fallacy (you are either a warrior or a compromiser), Causal Oversimplification (the only reason for a lack of conflict is spiritual failure), and Thought-Terminating Clichés.

Furthermore, the text uses manipulative tactics like a Red Herring (the irrelevant Kavanaugh poll) and factual Exaggeration to bolster its points. The entire piece is constructed not to present a case for consideration, but to indoctrinate the reader into a state of righteous conflict against a host of perceived enemies.
