1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the BDS movement as a “racist boycott movement” and refers to the group that removed the directors as a “mob.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly asserts that the students were removed because of their Jewish identity and that the BDS movement is inherently antisemitic. This message is stated directly multiple times by both the author and the quoted student.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text opens with an adaptation of Martin Niemöller's famous post-Holocaust confession, “First they came for the Jews. And then they came for everyone else,” which acts as a powerful, memorable slogan to frame the entire article.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The opening lines, “First they came for the Jews. And then they came for everyone else,” directly invoke the fear that if this action against Jewish students is tolerated, it will eventually expand to target other groups.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the reason given for the students' removal by stating, “Somehow I don't think being a member of a Muslim student group and supporting BDS would be considered a conflict of interest,” implying the stated reason of “conflicts of interest” is a pretext.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the normal process by calling the ratification vote “typically a mere formality” to exaggerate the abnormality of the events. It also potentially exaggerates by referring to the voting students as a “mob.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals strongly to identity, specifically Jewish identity. It frames the conflict as an attack on students “because they are Jewish” and quotes a student defending his “right to Jewish self-determination.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like “harassment and hate,” “racist boycott movement,” “mob,” “toxic campus press,” and “incitement to violence” to evoke strong negative feelings in the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text begins with an adaptation of a famous poem about the rise of the Nazis in Germany (“First they came for the Jews.”). This creates a direct, though implicit, comparison between the events at McGill and the persecution of Jews by a universally hated group.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is good because it is popular. In fact, it argues against the decision made by the majority in the student vote.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text asserts a simple cause for the students' removal: “this was about my Jewish identity, and nothing more.” This simplifies a complex campus political situation and dismisses the officially stated reason of "conflicts of interest" as entirely false.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and clear in its accusations and point of view. It does not use vague or obscure language to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – No – While the text quotes a student involved, it does not cite a recognized, external authority figure (like a famous academic or political leader) as evidence to support its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a simple binary: the students were removed either because of their Jewish identity (which the text presents as the truth) or for a legitimate “conflict of interest” (which the text presents as a lie). It doesn't allow for more complex interpretations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “The double standard here is pretty clear” is used to assert a conclusion as obvious, discouraging the reader from critically analyzing the comparison being made.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces Igor Sadikov and his past comment “punch a Zionist today.” While related to the general climate on campus, his specific role in the vote is presented vaguely (“one of the members of the mob”), and bringing up his more extreme past action serves to distract from the specifics of the vote and intensify the reader's negative emotional response.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the unstated argument that the BDS movement is not antisemitic. It sets up this opposing viewpoint with the rhetorical questions, “If BDS is not anti-Semitic, why did a BDS-led campaign name and shame me...?” and then uses the specific incident to knock down this simplified counter-argument.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text uses this technique twice, for example: “And we know exactly what the reaction would be if a student paper refused to publish any pro-Islamist content.” This deflects from the issue at hand by accusing opponents of potential hypocrisy in a hypothetical, reversed situation.

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary goal is not to objectively report on an event but to persuade the reader to adopt a very specific viewpoint by using a wide array of manipulative techniques. The article employs at least 15 of the 18 listed propaganda methods.

The piece immediately frames the event in the most extreme terms possible by alluding to the Holocaust (Reduction ad Hitlerum, Appeal to fear). It consistently uses emotionally Loaded Language (“mob,” “racist,” “toxic”) and Name-calling to demonize the opposing side, while simplifying the entire complex political dispute down to a single cause: antisemitism (Causal Oversimplification). It presents the situation as a simple choice between good and evil (Black & white fallacy) and dismisses the opponents' stated motivations by casting Doubt and charging them with hypocrisy (Whataboutism).

An objective news report would have included comments from the "Democratize SSMU" group, detailed their "conflict of interest" argument from their perspective, and avoided the heavily biased language and historical comparisons. This text, by contrast, selectively presents information and uses emotional manipulation over factual, balanced reporting to promote its agenda, which is the defining characteristic of propaganda.
