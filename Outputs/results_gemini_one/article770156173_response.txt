Name calling – Yes – The author calls the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, “dim-witted” and a “neocon poster-girl.”
Repetition – No – While the central theme of the dangers of war is reiterated, the text does not use the repetitive phrasing characteristic of this technique.
Slogans – Yes – The title of the article, “End The Korean War!”, functions as a slogan, a brief and memorable phrase summarizing the author's main call to action.
Appeal to fear – Yes – The text repeatedly highlights the catastrophic consequences of a potential war, such as “250,000 US casualties,” nuclear weapons that could “shatter Japan” and “cripple South Korea,” and the spread of “radioactive contamination over northern China and Pacific Russia.”
Doubt – Yes – The author questions President Trump’s strategy and understanding of the situation: “What President Trump really meant is that he has painted the US into a corner with all his threats of war and really does not know what to do next.”
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author minimizes Nikki Haley’s qualifications by stating her “foreign affairs experience appears to have been limited to the International House of Pancakes in her native South Carolina.”
Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism to make its case; rather, it is critical of US foreign policy and military actions.
Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases, such as calling the potential conflict a “slow and bloody slog,” describing Nikki Haley as a “dim-witted” “neocon poster-girl,” and mentioning “growing US hysteria.”
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular with a hated group like the Nazis to discredit it.
Bandwagon – Yes – The author suggests that his position is the popular one among those most affected: “Most South Koreans shrug off the North’s threats and seek to avoid war at all costs.”
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author states that North Korea developed nuclear weapons “for the sole reason of deterring a major US attack.” This simplifies a complex issue that likely involves internal politics, regime prestige, and regional power dynamics.
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s language is direct and his arguments are clearly stated, not deliberately obscure.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites the claims of “US experts” regarding missile range and also appeals to his own authority and experience by stating, “I’ve been in the deep North Korean-dug tunnels under the Demilitarized Zone.”
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text implicitly frames the situation as a choice between a catastrophic military conflict and the author's proposed diplomatic solution, largely ignoring other potential strategies or nuances. The choice presented is between a “bloody slog” and a “grand deal-maker” ending the war.
Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text is an argumentative essay that encourages thought and discussion on a topic, rather than using phrases to shut it down.
Red herring – No – The arguments, while biased, remain focused on the central topic of US-North Korea relations and the risks of war. No significant irrelevant material is introduced to distract from the main point.
Straw men – No – The author directly engages with the stated positions and actions of the Trump administration (threats, military exercises) rather than misrepresenting them to make them easier to attack.
Whataboutism – Yes – The author charges President Trump with hypocrisy: “President Trump – who himself avoided national military service in the 1960’s – keeps beating the war drums over North Korea.”

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it is structured as a political commentary and uses factual information (e.g., missile names, historical context of the Korean War), its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint by using a wide array of propaganda techniques.

The piece heavily relies on emotional manipulation, most notably through a strong **Appeal to Fear**, where it paints a vivid and terrifying picture of a potential war. It combines this with **Loaded Language** ("dim-witted," "bloody slog," "hysteria") to evoke negative emotions towards its targets. It directly attacks the character of political figures using **Name Calling** and **Whataboutism** to undermine their credibility rather than addressing their policies on merit alone.

Furthermore, the author employs logical fallacies like the **Black & White Fallacy** (presenting the only options as catastrophic war or his preferred diplomatic solution) and **Causal Oversimplification** (claiming North Korea's nuclear ambition has a "sole reason"). The use of techniques like **Doubt**, **Appeal to Authority**, and **Bandwagon** further serves to guide the reader's opinion. The sheer number and combination of these techniques demonstrate a clear intent to manipulate the audience's perception and emotions, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
