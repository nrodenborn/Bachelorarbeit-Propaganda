1. Name calling – Yes – The author attacks subjects with insulting labels, such as calling Luke Harding an “MI6 mouthpiece” and Hillary Clinton a “particularly obnoxious defeated candidate”.
2. Repetition – Yes – The central claim “Assange never met Manafort” is stated in the title and repeated verbatim later in the text to reinforce the message.
3. Slogans – No – The text uses strong, declarative sentences, but does not employ brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a classic slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The author instills fear by suggesting a dire outcome: that Assange will be “extradited from London to the USA on charges of espionage” and that state-controlled propaganda is creating a “massive ‘Big Lie’”.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire text is structured to cast doubt on the credibility of Luke Harding, The Guardian, and the Ecuadorean government, referring to their story as a “fabrication” and “blatant MI6 lies”.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates by calling Assange “the greatest publisher of his age” and William Binney “probably the world’s greatest expert”. It minimizes the official narrative of Russian interference by calling it a “non-existent Russian hack”.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity; in fact, it is critical of the governmental and security institutions of the US, UK, and Ecuador.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to influence the reader, such as “blatant MI6 lies”, “fake documents”, “latest fabrication”, and “pathetically failed”.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not associate any idea or person with Nazis or other groups widely hated by the target audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text argues against the mainstream or popular narrative, suggesting that the public consciousness is being manipulated by a “Big Lie”, rather than appealing to the popularity of an idea.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex situation, stating plainly that “the government of Ecuador is releasing lies about Assange to curry favour with the security establishment of the USA and UK”.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s language is direct and makes very specific accusations, rather than being deliberately unclear or vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites William Binney, described as a “former Technical Director of the NSA”, as an expert to support the claim that the DNC servers were not hacked. The author also presents themselves as a personal authority: “I am in a position to give you a personal assurance of them.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark choice: either the official narrative is a complete lie orchestrated by state security services, or it is true. It leaves no room for nuance, error, or alternative explanations. For example, “The press are not on the side of the people, they are an instrument of elite control.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “Those are the facts” is used to shut down further questioning or critical thought about the author’s preceding statements.
16. Red herring – Yes – While the central topic is the alleged Manafort-Assange meeting, the author dedicates significant space to discrediting the separate but related issue of the DNC server hack, introducing William Binney and Crowdstrike to distract from the primary claim and attack the credibility of the opposition on a broader front.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author reframes the purpose of the Guardian's story and the Mueller investigation into a simplified, easier-to-attack argument: that it is all just a partisan effort by Hillary Clinton’s supporters to “overturn the result of the US Presidential election”.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses on directly refuting the claims and attacking the credibility of the sources, rather than deflecting criticism of Assange by pointing out the hypocrisy of his accusers.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific and highly polarized viewpoint. This is achieved through the heavy use of numerous propaganda techniques. The author employs name-calling and loaded language (“MI6 mouthpiece,” “pathetically failed”) to create an emotional bias against the subjects of criticism. It heavily relies on casting doubt on established media and governmental bodies while simultaneously using an appeal to authority (William Binney, the author's own "personal assurance") to bolster its own credibility. The narrative is framed as a black & white fallacy, where the author and Assange are purveyors of absolute truth against a monolithic conspiracy of lies from the "elite." Complex geopolitical events are reduced to causal oversimplifications (Ecuador's motive is simply to "curry favour"). The sheer density of these techniques, woven into a narrative that attacks, discredits, and simplifies, moves the text far from objective analysis and firmly into the realm of propaganda.
