Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to any subject (suspect, police, situation).
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific message or phrase is repeated insistently throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to promote an idea or action (e.g., "Build the Wall").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text reports tragic events factually but does not attempt to instill fear to support an idea or course of action.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of anyone or anything; it reports facts and statements.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The description of events (officers killed, suspect critical) appears factual, without obvious exaggeration or downplaying.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or group identity to garner support.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – Language is generally neutral and descriptive (e.g., "fatal shot," "critical condition," "crying"). Words like "tragic" are inherent to the event, not emotionally manipulative in this context.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to universally despised groups (like Nazis) are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or action.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text reports previous police visits and the current event without explicitly stating a simple cause for the complex tragedy.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are reported clearly (times, events, sources like police reports, 911 calls). The phrase "presumably a police officer" indicates uncertainty, not intentional vagueness to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Information is attributed to sources (police reports, Chief Morbitzer, 911 calls) for factual reporting, not used as evidence to support a specific argument or idea beyond reporting the news.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents a sequence of events; it does not frame the situation as having only two choices or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking (e.g., "It is what it is," "That's just the way things are").
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the incident, the timeline, and relevant background (previous visits). No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text reports events and statements; it does not misrepresent or refute an argument not actually made.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – There is no attempt to charge an opponent with hypocrisy by referencing unrelated actions.

**Verdict – 5% – Explanation:**
The text is overwhelmingly a straightforward, factual news report detailing a tragic event: the fatal shooting of two police officers and the circumstances surrounding it. It relies on attributed sources (police reports, the police chief, released 911 call details) and presents a chronological sequence of events. The language is predominantly neutral and descriptive, focusing on relaying what happened, when, and who was involved. While the selection and framing of *any* news story inherently involves choices that could subtly influence perception, this text lacks the core hallmarks of propaganda as defined by the provided techniques. It does not employ emotionally manipulative language, logical fallacies, appeals to fear/patriotism/bandwagon, or techniques designed to discredit, oversimplify, or obscure. The 5% reflects the inherent potential for any reporting to frame reality, but this example leans heavily towards objective journalism rather than persuasive propaganda. The primary purpose appears to be informing, not persuading the audience towards a specific viewpoint or action beyond understanding the event.
