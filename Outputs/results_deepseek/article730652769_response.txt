Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – No – The term "illegal aliens" is used, which is factual terminology in immigration enforcement contexts. It is not an arbitrary insulting label (e.g., "invaders," "criminals").  
2. **Repetition** – No – Key terms like "illegal aliens" appear multiple times, but this is inherent to reporting facts about a repeated event. No deliberate repetition of a persuasive message.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed to persuade (e.g., "Build the wall" or "Secure our borders").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No language instills fear about immigration (e.g., threats to safety, jobs, or society). It neutrally reports apprehensions.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility (e.g., doubting law enforcement or government agencies).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Numbers (35, 25, 60) are specific and factual. No dramatic amplification or downplaying.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity (e.g., "protecting our homeland" or "defending America").  
8. **Loaded Language** – No – "Illegal aliens" is a legal term, not emotionally charged in this context (e.g., no added descriptors like "dangerous" or "flood").  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis, fascism, or hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeals to popularity (e.g., "Americans demand action").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No analysis of causes for immigration (e.g., blaming one factor like "lax policies").  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are clear: dates, locations, nationalities, and agencies involved. "No further details" is standard for ongoing investigations.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Mentions agencies (Border Patrol, HSI) as actors, not as proof of a broader claim (e.g., "Experts say this proves our borders are failing").  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Presents no options, choices, or policy implications.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases discouraging critical thought (e.g., "It’s common sense" or "This is the only way").  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions from the topic (apprehensions).  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., "What about previous administrations?").  

**Verdict – 0% –** The text is a straightforward law enforcement report detailing specific incidents. It uses factual, neutral language with no persuasive intent, emotional manipulation, or ideological framing. Terms like "illegal aliens" and "stash houses" are descriptive and contextually appropriate for official communications. No technique encourages a specific viewpoint or action, making it informational rather than propagandistic.
