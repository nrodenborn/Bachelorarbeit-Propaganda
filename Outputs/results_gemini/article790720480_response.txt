1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Senator Jeff Flake a "RINO" (Republican In Name Only) and refers to Senator Cory Booker as a "self-professed sexual assaulter."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases that function as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses on anger and indignation towards opponents rather than instilling fear about the consequences of not confirming Kavanaugh.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly casts doubt on the credibility of the allegations against Kavanaugh, calling them "unsubstantiated" and stating they are "without a shred of evidence."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the allegations by stating there isn't "a shred of evidence" and exaggerates the Obama administration by calling it a "regime."
7. Flag-Waving – No – While the text quotes Senator Flake mentioning "This country is being ripped apart," the author does not use appeals to patriotism to support their own argument.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "good riddance," "put through the ringer," "has a spine," and "Obama regime" to influence the reader's emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to widely hated groups like Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular; rather, it frames its viewpoint as being in opposition to Democrats and a "RINO."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex reasons for the FBI investigation by stating it is "unclear" why it's needed, attributing the situation solely to the denials of named individuals.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and clear in its opinions and attacks; it is not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the denials of the individuals named by Dr. Ford, including her "girl friend," as authoritative evidence that the event did not happen.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice: one either fully supports Kavanaugh, or one is siding with the Democrats. It frames Senator Flake's call for an investigation not as a middle ground but as a betrayal, implying there are only two sides.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "good riddance" is used to dismiss Senator Flake entirely, discouraging any nuanced discussion of his actions or motivations.
16. Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of a poll asking "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is completely irrelevant to the topic of the Kavanaugh nomination and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents Senator Flake's stated argument for "due diligence" by reframing it as a matter of his personal "comfort," then attacks this weaker argument: "Comfort? What about Judge Kavanaugh's comfort...?"
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects from the actions of the Republicans on the committee by claiming that under the "Obama regime... Republicans were subjected to far worse," a tactic used to charge the opposition with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform the reader but to persuade them to adopt a highly partisan viewpoint by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques. The article moves beyond reporting the factual event (the 11-10 committee vote) to launch a series of emotionally-charged attacks and arguments. It heavily relies on name-calling ("RINO"), loaded language ("good riddance," "Obama regime"), and casting doubt on the opposition to create a strong in-group/out-group dynamic. Furthermore, it uses logical fallacies like the straw man to misrepresent opponents' arguments, whataboutism to deflect criticism, and causal oversimplification to dismiss the core issue. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions rather than to provide a balanced account of the events.
