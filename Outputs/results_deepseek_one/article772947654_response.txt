Below is the analysis of propaganda techniques in Newt Gingrich's text, followed by the verdict:  

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:  
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Russian dictator" (to vilify Putin), "radical-extremist wing of the Democratic Party" (to disparage political opponents), and "weakness on a pathetic scale" (to insult Obama's policies).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "very firm stance" (repeated twice in Trump's quote), and emphasis on Obama-era officials' failures (e.g., "they buried it," "their failure").  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "Trump’s America: The Truth About Our Nation’s Great Comeback" (book title used as a rallying phrase).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings about Russian interference ("prevent Russian interference in 2018") and "cultural civil war" (to evoke dread about societal collapse).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Obama officials' credibility: "probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks" and "they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes Trump’s Helsinki error as an "aberration," while exaggerating Obama’s actions as "weakness on a pathetic scale."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "protect America," "secure our election systems," and "strengthen NATO" (appeals to patriotism).  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Firestorm of controversy," "vicious comments," "hysteria," "nastiness," "guilt" (emotionally charged words).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "New York Times best-selling book" (implies popular endorsement).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames Obama solely for Russian meddling: "they ignored it, because they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win" (ignores broader complexities).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – "real actions," "strong action," and "variety of reasons" for sanctions (avoids specifics).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Uses Trump’s self-correction ("I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn’t’") and Gingrich’s own expertise ("Anyone who has studied President Trump knows...") as validation.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents Trump as "tough on Russia" vs. Obama’s "weakness," ignoring nuance: "far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being."  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "It is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm" (shuts down debate).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Shifts focus to Obama’s failures when discussing Trump’s Helsinki performance: "the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump... are the people who failed to protect America."  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Portrays critics as solely focused on Trump while ignoring their own failures: "attack Trump ferociously to hide their own failure."  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Accuses Obama officials of hypocrisy: "These former officials attack Trump... to hide their own failure and their own guilt."  

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs 16 of 18 analyzed techniques to lionize Trump, vilify opponents (e.g., Obama, Democrats, intelligence officials), and deflect criticism of Trump’s Helsinki summit. Key tactics include:  
- **Distraction**: Redirecting blame to Obama/Brennan/Clapper (red herring/whataboutism) when addressing Trump’s controversial actions.  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language ("hysteria," "nastiness") and fear appeals ("cultural civil war," Russian threats) to polarize readers.  
- **Oversimplification**: Reducing U.S.-Russia relations to Trump’s "strength" vs. Obama’s "weakness," ignoring geopolitical nuances.  
- **Credibility Attacks**: Systematically undermining critics (e.g., implying former officials are paid off or guilty) while elevating Trump’s narrative via repetition and self-citation.  
Gingrich’s piece serves as political persuasion, not balanced analysis, using demonization, false dichotomies, and diversion to defend Trump and attack adversaries. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges minor factual references (e.g., sanctions), but these are framed propagandistically.
