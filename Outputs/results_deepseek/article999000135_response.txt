Here is the analysis of the propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "absolute hypocrite," "hypocritical, lying, fake news outlet," "useful idiot, propagandist snowflake."
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated verbatim three times. Also, the core accusation of hypocrisy and demonization is repeated throughout.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No distinct, memorable phrase is coined and used as a slogan within the text itself.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Describes the migrants as having "busted through customs gates," "pushed at the Mexican border," "committing all sorts of crimes," and being a threat that might require military force to stop.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – Repeatedly questions Don Lemon's credibility, sincerity, and sanity: "absolute hypocrite," "How can he contradict himself...?", "said what is clearly not only racist but utterly insane," "No one is demonizing an ethnicity but Don Lemon," "He's a useful idiot, propagandist snowflake," "you won't get common sense on CNN."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes (Exaggeration) – Uses extreme language: "absolute hypocrite," "utterly insane," "busted through customs gates," "committing all sorts of crimes." Minimizes any potential legitimacy of the migrants' actions or Lemon's point by framing it solely as lawbreaking and threat.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to patriotism/national identity by emphasizing protecting US borders, upholding US immigration laws, and framing resistance to the migrants as "common sense" national self-preservation ("we will not allow such persons across our border").
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Uses highly emotionally charged and prejudicial words: "hypocrite," "lying," "fake news," "illegally enter," "busted through," "crimes," "radicalized," "insane," "demonizing," "useful idiot," "snowflake," "Islamic jihad," "statism," "violating the law," "common sense."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt to link Lemon, CNN, or the migrants to Nazis or Hitler.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Does not explicitly appeal to the popularity of the ideas presented ("common sense" implies universality but isn't framed as "everyone agrees").
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Simplifies the complex issues of migration, terrorism, and rhetoric by blaming problems solely on the migrant caravan (depicted as inherently criminal) and figures like Don Lemon (depicted as solely racist/hypocritical), ignoring systemic, economic, or political factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is highly opinionated but generally direct and clear in its accusations and language, not deliberately obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No reference to any authority figure or institution to support the claims made (relies on opinion and characterization).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents the poll with only two extreme options regarding the migrant caravan: "Yes, military force should be used" or "No, keep the military out of it," ignoring nuanced policy options. Also frames Lemon's position as wanting to ban all white men ("He just doesn't want white men here").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Uses phrases like "common sense," "useful idiot," and "simply common sense" to shut down critical examination of the border policy stance. "Fake news" is used to dismiss CNN outright.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introduces the irrelevant topic of "Islamic jihad" and "statism" when discussing Lemon's comments about the migrant caravan and white men, distracting from the core arguments about immigration and Lemon's perceived hypocrisy.
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents Lemon's argument as wanting to ban white men ("He just doesn't want white men here") and frames his call to not demonize the migrants as him thinking their actions are "just fine," neither of which are positions Lemon expressed in the quoted remarks.
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – The core accusation is that Don Lemon is a hypocrite for demonizing white men while asking others not to demonize the migrant caravan ("How's that for hypocrisy?"). This charges him with hypocrisy without necessarily engaging deeply with the substance of his points about different perceived threats.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a very high density of propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to aggressively attack Don Lemon and CNN, dismiss their perspectives, instill fear about migrants, and promote a specific partisan viewpoint. Key indicators include pervasive **Name Calling**, **Loaded Language**, and **Doubt** targeting Lemon/CNN; **Appeal to Fear** and **Causal Oversimplification** regarding migrants; **Repetition** of core accusations and the poll; **Flag-Waving**; **Black & White Fallacy** in the poll; **Thought-Terminating Clichés**; **Red Herring**; **Straw Men** misrepresentations of Lemon's arguments; and **Whataboutism** focused on hypocrisy. The extreme language, lack of nuance, reliance on emotional manipulation over factual argument, and clear intent to discredit an opponent while rallying support for a specific ideological position overwhelmingly characterize this as propaganda. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the text is based on (selectively quoted) real statements, but its framing and presentation are overwhelmingly propagandistic.
