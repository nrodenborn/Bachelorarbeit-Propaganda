Here are the propaganda techniques and whether they are used in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text attacks the Pope's character by citing a book that describes his papacy as "the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of recent history."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the core message that the Pope's declaration is illegitimate and heretical. This message is presented in various ways, such as calling it "objective mortal sin," "heresy or sacrilege," and "counter-magisterial."

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as a rallying cry.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting a catastrophic outcome for the Church, stating, "Should this happen, the Mystical Body would then be without its head," and that a pope professing heresy would "cease, by that act, to be the Pope."

Doubt – Yes – The entire text is designed to cast doubt on the legitimacy and authority of the Pope's declaration. For example: "The problem with this is that heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial, so that if it is, it not only has no binding force, but the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to heighten the sense of crisis. Example: "As reported in The Dictator Pope—a remarkable new book which provides an inside look at the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of recent history".

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of traditional Catholic identity to rally opposition against the current Pope. It invokes the authority of "St. Thomas Aquinas" and calls upon "the faithful" to resist, framing this resistance as a duty to the faith.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's opinion. Examples include "adulterers," "objective mortal sin," "heresy," "sacrilege," "tyrannical," and "dissenting left."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest the reader should adopt a viewpoint because it is popular. In fact, it frames its own position as a necessary resistance against a powerful, established authority.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text presents a complex theological argument rather than attributing a complex event to a single, simple cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and arguments, not vague or confusing.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the support of other authorities to challenge the Pope's authority. Example: "St. Thomas Aquinas says in his Summa Theologiae: 'If the faith were endangered, a subject ought to rebuke his prelate [pope] even publicly.'" It also cites Cardinal Burke and canonist Franz Wernz.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as having only two possible outcomes: either the Pope's declaration is heretical and must be resisted, or it is not. Example: "The problem with this is that heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial, so that if it is, it not only has no binding force, but the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration."

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; rather, it attempts to build a specific, critical argument.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the book "The Dictator Pope" and a quote about Francis's election to distract from the central theological issue and instead attack the Pope's character and the politics behind his papacy.

Straw men – No – The text directly engages with the Pope's letter and the Argentinian bishops' guidelines, rather than refuting a weaker, unstated argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge the Pope with hypocrisy by pointing to his own past actions.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It is not a neutral or objective report on a Vatican decision, but a polemical article written with the clear intent to persuade the reader that the Pope has committed a heretical act and to incite resistance among the "faithful." The author systematically employs a wide range of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. Loaded language ("heresy," "sacrilege," "tyrannical") is used throughout to create a strong emotional and negative response. The author appeals to fear by warning of a Church "without its head," a catastrophic scenario for believers. The entire piece is an exercise in casting doubt on the Pope's authority, which is reinforced by a black-and-white fallacy that presents resistance as the only option for a true Catholic. It uses flag-waving by appealing to traditional Catholic identity and selectively uses appeals to authority (St. Thomas Aquinas, Cardinal Burke) to undermine the current papal authority. The use of exaggeration and red herrings further demonstrates that the text's primary purpose is not to inform, but to delegitimize and rally opposition.
