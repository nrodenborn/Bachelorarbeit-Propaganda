Verdict – 60% – The text contains several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, obfuscation, and appeal to authority. These elements suggest a significant likelihood of propaganda, as they aim to influence the audience's perception of the Mueller investigation and cast doubt on its legitimacy. However, not all techniques are present, and the text also includes factual information and counterpoints, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood of it being pure propaganda.
