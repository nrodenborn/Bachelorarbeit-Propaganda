### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text repeatedly uses insulting labels for Pope Francis ("Bergoglio"), such as "power-mad ecclesiastical tyrant," "Dictator Pope," and "wolf."  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: Phrases like "Bergoglio must go," "deposition," and "resignation" are reiterated throughout the text to reinforce the message.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "Bergoglio must go" acts as a memorable, rallying cry repeated in the conclusion.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text warns of dire consequences if Francis remains pope (e.g., "grave threat to the common good of the Church," "leading an apostasy from the truth," and "worst crisis in her history").  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Questions Francis’ credibility and motives, e.g., "Fisher knows that Francis knows it" (implying deliberate abuse cover-up) and "whether Francis knows it or not" (suggesting hidden malice).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggerates Francis’ actions as a "plague," "ecclesial subversion," and "unspeakable crimes," while minimizing opposing views as "pious fable" or "papalotry."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to Catholic identity and tradition, e.g., defending the "Deposit of Faith" and invoking historical Church authority (Synod of Sutri, Cajetan).  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged terms like "monster" (McCarrick), "malintent," "wreaking havoc," "serial homosexual rapist," and "cabal."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No direct comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups; historical references (e.g., Vichy) are absent.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Explanation: Cites "29 bishops" supporting Viganò and figures like Edward Peters to validate the call for investigation/resignation.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Blames all Church problems solely on Francis (e.g., "the plague of Bergoglio," attributing schisms and moral decline entirely to him).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: Arguments are detailed (e.g., canon law citations, historical precedents), not deliberately unclear.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Relies on figures like Archbishop Viganò, Edward Peters, Cajetan, and the Synod of Sutri to legitimize claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents only two options: depose Francis or face Church ruin (e.g., "the Church cannot abide this pontificate any longer").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses phrases like "Bergoglio must go" and "no longer anything to assume" to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: Diverts to historical papal depositions (Synod of Sutri) and canon law debates instead of addressing evidence for Francis’ alleged crimes.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: Misrepresents supporters of Francis as engaging in "papalotry" (blind worship) or ignoring abuse, e.g., reducing their stance to "love and obey no matter what."  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: Does not accuse critics of hypocrisy; focuses on Francis’ actions without diverting to others’ flaws.

### Verdict – 95% – Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of emotional manipulation, biased framing, and persuasive techniques to advance a specific agenda (deposing Pope Francis). Key indicators include:  
- **Aggressive demonization** of Francis via name-calling, loaded language, and fear appeals.  
- **One-sided narrative** that dismisses counter-evidence (e.g., dismissing Fisher’s nuance as a "fig leaf").  
- **Appeals to group identity** (traditional Catholicism) and authority (canonists, bishops) to legitimize extremism (deposition).  
- **Historical/canonical cherry-picking** to justify radical action while ignoring modern theological consensus.  
- **Urgent, divisive rhetoric** (e.g., "the Church will have to repel an attacker") aimed at mobilizing readers against a perceived enemy.  
While it cites real events (Viganò’s testimony), the text’s relentless hostility, lack of neutrality, and reliance on 12+ propaganda techniques confirm its propagandistic intent. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges its use of factual elements (e.g., canon law), but these are weaponized to serve the agenda.
