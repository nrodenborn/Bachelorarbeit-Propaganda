Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "Synodal Schemers," "predatory clerics and prelates," "notorious Cardinal Theodore McCarrick," "homosexual network of clergy and prelates," "predators and coverup enablers."
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The phrase "How inconvenient that..." is repeated 7 times throughout the text to hammer home the author's points about the Synod and scandals.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "#StopTheSynod2018" and "Stop the Synod" are used as rallying cries.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Repeatedly warns of "moral and physical dangers" to youth attending the Synod, "moral and physical exploitation of the youth," "bankrupting the American Church," "litany of lives of total moral, physical, emotional devastation," and "dark night of the soul of the Catholic Church."
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool" is used to cast doubt on Pope Francis's wisdom and judgment. Questions Farrell's claim he "never knew anything" ("How inconvenient that Farrell... roomed with... McCarrick... and never knew...").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration: Calling McCarrick the "most prolific serial predator... in the history of the American Church," "global homosexual clergy predation scandal," "dirty secret," "sordid lifestyle," "total moral, physical, emotional devastation." Minimization: Describing Church doctrine on homosexuality as a "nagging and unmerciful Catholic catechism doctrine."
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – While the text appeals to Catholic identity, it does so negatively (criticizing the hierarchy's actions as betraying the Church) rather than positively appealing to patriotism or identity to support its own cause. The appeal is more to outrage and fear than pride.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "masterfully manipulated, rigged, and exploited," "backdoor tactics and machinations," "synodal antics," "code language," "pro-LBGT agenda," "providential irony," "predatory behavior," "naive views," "embraces the relaxation," "blasted," "coverup enablers," "sneaky synodal tactics," "cleverly uses," "skewer the results," "stuff the ballot box," "dirty secret," "personal wreckage," "brutally portrayed," "sordid lifestyle," "makes a mockery," "unsuspecting youth," "flamboyantly flashing," "rainbow flags."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – The text does not attempt to disapprove of an idea by linking it to a universally hated group (like Nazis).
10. **Bandwagon – No** – The text does not primarily argue that its position is correct *because* it's popular. It cites journalists and a report, but popularity isn't the core appeal.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Repeatedly presents the complex issues of clerical sexual abuse and Church governance as being caused primarily or solely by the presence of homosexual clergy and the relaxation of doctrine on homosexuality ("the underlying cause of the criminal scandal lies in the homosexual network," "the direct result of a clerical culture which embraced homosexuality").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is direct, accusatory, and specific in its claims and language. It does not use unclear expressions to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Cites "Edward Pentin, Henry Sire, George Neumayr and an array of investigative journalists" and the "Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report" to bolster credibility for its claims about manipulation and scandal.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents only two options: Cancel the Synod immediately ("this Synod must be cancelled") or subject youth to "moral and physical exploitation." Also implies the only valid "expression of pastoral concern" is cooperating with criminal investigations ("The only compelling expression...", "That is the only expression...").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Uses "code language" to dismiss the Pope's statement about listening ("That’s code language that the Pope will be 'dialoging' and 'accompanying' and 'hearing' the pro-LBGT agenda"). Uses "We’ve caught on to his sneaky synodal tactics" to dismiss the synodal process itself.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – While related to the theme of youth, the text constantly diverts from the stated topics of the Synod (Youth and Vocations) to focus extensively on the clergy abuse scandals, homosexuality, and specific individuals (McCarrick, Farrell), using these as the primary reason to stop the Synod rather than engaging substantively with the Synod's planned discussions.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Misrepresents the Pope's statement "no one will be excluded" and the Instrumentum Laboris paragraph (§197 IL) about understanding LGBT youths' desire for closeness as an active embrace and promotion of the "LGBT lifestyle" and a plot to "minimize" or "relax" doctrine. Presents the Synod's aim as justifying abuse ("makes a mockery of the suffering... and justifies the decades-old scandal").
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The text does not primarily counter criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy. It makes direct accusations but doesn't use "what about X" as a deflection tactic.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a large majority of the listed techniques (14 out of 18) extensively and aggressively. Its primary purpose is not balanced analysis or reporting but to persuade readers to a specific, highly critical viewpoint (that the Synod is a dangerous manipulation by a corrupt hierarchy, intrinsically linked to homosexual predation, and must be stopped) and to drive action (signing the petition). It relies heavily on emotional manipulation (fear, outrage), repetition, loaded language, name-calling, oversimplification of complex issues, creating false dichotomies, misrepresentation of opposing views (straw men), and leveraging authority figures and reports selectively. While it references real events (McCarrick scandal, Pennsylvania Report), these are used as building blocks within a highly biased and manipulative argumentative framework characteristic of propaganda. The presence of a direct call to action (the petition) further underscores its persuasive intent.
