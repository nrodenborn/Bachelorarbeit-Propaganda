1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly refers to the Mueller investigation as the "Mueller circus," an insulting label meant to frame it as a spectacle rather than a serious inquiry. It also labels investigators as "Mueller coup members."
2. Repetition – Yes – The phrase "Mueller circus" is used in the title and the first sentence to reinforce the central message that the investigation was a spectacle.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase "Never underestimate the power of the swamp's spite" is a brief, memorable phrase that encapsulates a key theme of the text.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that continued investigations will "undermine President Trump," prevent reforms, and bring the country "closer to a proper Roman circus," instilling fear about the consequences of the opposition's actions.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the Mueller report by stating it contains "inevitable lies, smears and assaults" and attributes it to the "Obama/Clinton team."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text claims the media made "ten times" the cost of the investigation and that their fortunes are "priceless," which are unsubstantiated exaggerations. Calling investigators "coup members" is also a significant exaggeration.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity; its focus is on internal political factions and conflicts.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like "circus," "lies," "smears," "assaults," "coup members," "swamp's spite," and "malice" to evoke a strong negative reaction from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest that the ideas it opposes are popular with groups like Nazis or other figures widely hated by the target audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is good because it is popular. Instead, it frames the "voting public" as being in opposition to a powerful, unpopular elite.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex motivations behind the Mueller investigation and other state-level inquiries to three simple goals: media profit, undermining Trump, and punishing voters.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and point of view; it does not use deliberately obscure or confusing language.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does not use the support of an authority figure or institution as evidence for its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a world of two opposing sides: President Trump and the voting public versus "the swamp," the media, and the "resistance." It leaves no room for nuance or alternative perspectives.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like "Never underestimate the power of the swamp's spite" and "Culture wars are built on tribal rage" serve to shut down discussion by offering a simplistic and final-sounding explanation for complex events.
16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on its central argument against the Mueller investigation and related inquiries, without introducing irrelevant topics to distract the audience.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes arguments that were not the official basis for the investigation. For example, it claims a goal was to "punish the voting public for electing Trump," a motive that was never stated by the investigators, and then attacks this fabricated motive.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text attacks its opponents directly but does not use the specific tactic of deflecting a criticism by accusing the opponent of the same or a similar offense.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint by employing a dense concentration of propaganda techniques. The piece systematically uses loaded language ("circus," "lies," "smears," "coup") and name-calling to create an immediate emotional bias against the subject. It employs causal oversimplification and straw men by reducing the complex motivations for the investigations to a simple, malicious plot to "punish the voting public" and enrich the media, which misrepresents the stated purpose of the legal inquiries. Furthermore, it creates a stark black & white fallacy, pitting "the voting public" against a monolithic and evil "swamp," and uses an appeal to fear by warning that this "swamp" will undermine the president and the country. The cumulative effect of these techniques is to bypass critical analysis and provoke an emotional, tribalistic response in the reader, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
