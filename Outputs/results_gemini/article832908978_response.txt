Verdict – 10% – The text itself is a news report, not a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about President Trump's and his team's reactions to the imminent release of the Mueller report. It follows journalistic conventions by citing multiple sources, attributing quotes, and providing context for events. However, the text is heavily focused on *reporting* the propaganda techniques used by President Trump and his campaign. It quotes their use of name-calling ("WITCH HUNT"), loaded language ("angry liberals"), causal oversimplification, and other techniques. Because the article is a vehicle that transmits these propaganda messages to the reader—even in the context of reporting—it is not entirely free from a propagandistic effect. The framing of the story and the choice of quotes could be seen as subtly reinforcing a particular narrative. Therefore, while the article's structure and intent are journalistic, its content is saturated with reported propaganda, giving it a very low likelihood of being propaganda itself.
