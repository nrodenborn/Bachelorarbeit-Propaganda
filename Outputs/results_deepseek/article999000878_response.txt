Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "act like a child" (in the poll option).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrase used to encapsulate the message.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – No attempt to instill fear against alternatives is present.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "it is obvious that President Trump was making a sincere effort... Acosta refused to hand the mic over" frames Trump's actions as unquestionably reasonable and casts doubt on Acosta's behavior/credibility.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "forcefully push" (exaggeration of Acosta's action with the intern), "rightfully losing his patients [patience]" (minimization/justification of Trump's reaction).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "vicious attacks", "threats" (used by Donaldson describing responses to Acosta), "tense incident", "sharp back-and-forth", "tussle", "forcefully push", "rightfully losing his patients [patience]", "escorted from the room", "deserved".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No suggestion that the idea is popular with a hated group.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to the popularity of the idea (revoking the pass) is made.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The complex event (lawsuit, press freedom, altercation) isn't reduced to a single simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is relatively direct; no deliberate obscurity is evident.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Citing Sam Donaldson (experienced correspondent) and Floyd Mayweather (constitutional lawyer) to lend credibility to the lawsuit's strength and context.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – The poll presents limited, polarized options, especially "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass", framing the issue simplistically.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "He deserved to have his credentials revoked." ends the discussion definitively.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Introducing Donaldson's 2006 confrontation with President Bush ("trading personal insults") is irrelevant to the Acosta incident and lawsuit but distracts by painting Donaldson (and by association, Acosta/CNN) as habitually confrontational.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – No misrepresentation of an opposing argument is present.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No charging of an opponent with hypocrisy related to the core issue.

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits several clear propaganda techniques (Repetition, Name-calling, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating clichés, Red Herring). The language is heavily loaded against Acosta/CNN and in favor of the White House's actions. The structure (repetitive poll, selective reporting of events like the "forceful push", inclusion of Donaldson's past) frames the narrative to discredit Acosta and legitimize the revocation of his credentials, while downplaying Trump's role. While it reports factual elements (lawsuit discussion, statements), the overall presentation is heavily slanted and employs persuasive techniques characteristic of propaganda. The percentage reflects the significant presence of these techniques shaping the narrative, though it stops short of being entirely fabricated.
