Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including doubt, loaded language, black & white fallacy, and whataboutism. These elements suggest an attempt to influence the audience's perception of the Democratic Party's handling of the allegations against Ellison and Kavanaugh. However, not all propaganda techniques are present, and the text does provide some factual information, which reduces the likelihood of it being pure propaganda.
