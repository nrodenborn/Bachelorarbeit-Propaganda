Here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – No – The text does not attack any subject with insulting labels. Terms like "urban Ebola" are descriptive, not derogatory.
2.  **Repetition** – No – While "explosive increase" is mentioned twice, it's a direct quote from the same official (Peter Salama) describing the situation, not a deliberate repetition technique for emphasis beyond reporting his statement.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries or slogans (e.g., "Build the Wall"). Terms like "urban Ebola" are descriptive, not slogan-like.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text emphasizes the danger and potential spread ("explosive increase," "urban Ebola," "very different animal," "spreading to surrounding countries," "city of 10 million people") to convey urgency. Example: "Experts fear an ‘explosive increase’ in Ebola cases... The potential for an explosive increase in cases is now there... raised the prospect of Ebola spreading to surrounding countries... as well as downstream to Kinshasa, a city of 10 million people."
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person, organization, or information. It reports statements and facts.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The reported statements ("explosive increase," "urban Ebola") are presented as assessments from health officials (WHO) based on the new development (spread to a city). The numbers (44 infected, 23 dead) and risks are presented factually without apparent inflation or downplay by the *reporting*.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There are no appeals to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity to garner support.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – While largely factual, terms like "explosive increase," "very different animal," and "urban Ebola" carry strong negative connotations designed to evoke concern and urgency. Example: "‘We have urban Ebola, which is a very different animal from rural Ebola. The potential for an explosive increase in cases is now there.’"
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There are no comparisons made to Nazis or other universally hated groups to disapprove of an idea.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not argue for an idea based on its popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text does not present a simple cause for the outbreak or its potential spread. It describes factors (spread to a city, transportation hub, river routes) contributing to the increased risk.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The language is clear and specific (e.g., location names, case numbers, transmission factors, vaccine storage challenges).
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text repeatedly cites statements from the WHO (Peter Salama, "the WHO said") and the DR Congo Health Minister (Oly Ilunga Kalenga) to establish the credibility and seriousness of the information. Example: "Senior World Health Organization (WHO) official Peter Salama said...", "Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga confirmed...", "the WHO said".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text does not present a complex situation with only two extreme choices or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking. The text presents information for consideration.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text remains focused on the Ebola outbreak, its spread, risks, and response efforts. No irrelevant topics are introduced.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that wasn't made.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse anyone of hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions or other issues.

**Verdict – 15% –** The text primarily reports factual information about a developing health crisis (Ebola outbreak spreading to an urban center in Congo), citing official sources (WHO, Congo Health Minister) and providing specific details (location, case numbers, transmission risks, response measures). While it uses **Appeal to Authority** (relying on WHO/minister statements) and **Loaded Language** (terms like "explosive increase," "urban Ebola," "very different animal") which are common propaganda techniques, these are used within the context of conveying the assessed severity of the situation by experts, rather than to promote a specific agenda unrelated to public health warning. The **Appeal to Fear** is present but stems directly from the reported expert assessments of the objective risk ("potential for an explosive increase"). There is no evident attempt to manipulate the audience towards a specific political, ideological, or commercial action beyond urging awareness and preparedness for the health threat. The core purpose appears to be informative reporting on a significant public health development, using the language and sources appropriate to that context, making the likelihood of it being deliberate propaganda low. The techniques used are mild and contextually justified for a health alert.
