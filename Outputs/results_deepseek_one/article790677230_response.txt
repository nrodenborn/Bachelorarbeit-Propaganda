### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly propagandistic** due to:  
1. **Systematic technique use**: 15/18 techniques are present, demonstrating a coordinated persuasive effort.  
2. **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded language ("righteous indignation"), fear appeals (legitimizing "despicable" acts), and name-calling ("desperate Democrats") dominate.  
3. **Partisan framing**: Exclusively defends Kavanaugh while portraying Democrats as conspiratorial (e.g., "lying in wait," "secret evidence," "obstruct by any means").  
4. **Suppression of nuance**:  
   - Dismisses Ford’s testimony as "ridiculous" despite her "100%" certainty.  
   - Ignores legitimate concerns about FBI investigation limits.  
   - Reduces complex confirmation to a "sham" or "disgrace."  
5. **Selective fact presentation**:  
   - Highlights GOP efforts (e.g., contacting witnesses) but omits Democratic requests for broader investigations.  
   - Cites witness denials supporting Kavanaugh while downplaying Ford’s lack of corroboration as a Democratic tactic.  
6. **Appeals to tribalism**: Portrays conservatives as victims of unethical attacks and frames opposition as power-hungry ("Boy, you all want power").  

**Why not 100%?**  
The text includes verifiable facts (e.g., Feinstein withholding Ford’s letter, witness statements). However, these are embedded in a heavily slanted narrative that meets technical definitions of propaganda by *systematically manipulating emotion, distorting context, and discouraging critical engagement*. The sheer density of techniques confirms its propagandistic intent.
