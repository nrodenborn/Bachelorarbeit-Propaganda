Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack a subject. Phrases like “Urban Ebola” are used descriptively to differentiate the situation from “rural Ebola,” not as an insult.

Repetition – No – While the phrase “explosive increase” is used twice, it is part of a direct quote from a single official being reported on, not a message repeated by the author to drill a point.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text repeatedly highlights the most frightening aspects of the situation to instill fear. Example: “Senior World Health Organization (WHO) official Peter Salama said the spread to Mbandaka meant there was the potential for an ‘explosive increase’ in cases.”

Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or organization; instead, it uses them as sources to build its narrative.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text frames the situation in the most dramatic way possible, selecting and headlining the most alarming quotes. Example: The headline itself, “’We Now Have Urban Ebola’ In Congo, WHO Warns Of ‘Potentially Explosive Increase’ In Cases,” is a form of exaggeration by emphasizing the most alarming possible interpretation of events.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses words and phrases intended to provoke an emotional response rather than a rational one. Example: “Ebola is most feared for the internal and external bleeding it can cause in victims owing to damage done to blood vessels.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is valid because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not propose a simple cause for the complex event of an Ebola outbreak.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and provides specific details and quotes rather than being deliberately unclear.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on statements from official sources to lend credibility to its alarming message. Example: “The BBC reports that Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga confirmed a case in Mbandaka, a city of a million people...”

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present the situation as having only two possible outcomes or options.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any clichés to shut down critical thought.

Red herring – No – All the information presented is relevant to the topic of the Ebola outbreak.

Straw men – No – The text is not structured as an argument and does not refute a position that was not presented.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any party of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 70% – The text functions as propaganda by carefully selecting and framing factual information to generate a specific emotional response: fear. While it is structured as a news report and does not contain outright fabrications, its primary purpose is not neutral information delivery but emotional manipulation. This is achieved through a powerful combination of **Appeal to Fear** (focusing on an "explosive increase," spread to a major city, and proximity to a capital of 10 million), **Loaded Language** (describing Ebola as "most feared" for its gruesome symptoms), and **Exaggeration** (the highly dramatic headline). The entire narrative is given a veneer of credibility by its heavy reliance on **Appeal to Authority**, quoting the WHO, a health minister, and other news outlets. The curation of only the most alarming quotes and facts, while omitting or downplaying countervailing information (like the population's experience with Ebola), turns what could be a factual report into a piece of alarmist propaganda.
