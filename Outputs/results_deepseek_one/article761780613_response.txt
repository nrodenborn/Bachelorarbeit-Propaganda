### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to concentrated use of manipulative techniques. Trump’s statements dominate the narrative, employing:  
- **Name-calling** ("Witch Hunt Hoax") to delegitimize the investigation.  
- **Emotional appeals** ("lives ruined") to provoke fear/anger.  
- **Causal oversimplification** and **black/white framing** to scapegoat Sessions.  
- **Thought-terminating clichés** to discourage scrutiny.  
- **Exaggeration/doubt** to undermine trust in institutions.  

While CNN’s framing is factual, the quoted content serves Trump’s agenda: deflecting blame, discrediting investigators, and rallying supporters. The absence of counter-evidence or context (e.g., *why* Sessions recused) further signals propagandistic intent. The text’s core function is persuasion, not balanced reporting, warranting a 95% likelihood of propaganda (5% uncertainty reflects CNN’s neutral scaffolding).
