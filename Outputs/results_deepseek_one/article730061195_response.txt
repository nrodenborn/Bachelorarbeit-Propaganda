### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:
1. **Name calling** – No – The text uses factual labels like "cop killing suspect" without insulting epithets.  
2. **Repetition** – No – No phrases are repeated excessively for emphasis.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No memorable phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL!") are used.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text describes events factually without instilling fear of alternatives.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility (e.g., "Can the same be said for Obama?").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Details are reported neutrally (e.g., "Smith had injuries" without downplaying/overstating).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or group identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Pleads for help," "crying," and "hiding in the bushes" evoke emotional distress, potentially amplifying sympathy or outrage.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to hated groups (e.g., Nazis).  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "Time for US to do same").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified causes (e.g., domestic violence history isn't framed as the sole reason).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are specific (e.g., timelines, prior incidents) without deliberate confusion.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Authorities (e.g., police, records) are cited for facts, not as unquestionable proof.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomies (e.g., "oppose evil or feed it").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases halting critical thought (e.g., "I do not really see any problems").  
16. **Red herring** – No – All details (e.g., prior domestic calls, Smith’s conviction) directly contextualize the event.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., "Trump avoided military service but beats war drums").  

### Verdict – 5% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **not propaganda** but **factual news reporting**. It objectively details a crime using verified information (e.g., 911 call transcripts, police records, prior convictions). The sole instance of loaded language ("pleads," "crying") serves to convey the wife’s distress accurately, not to manipulate emotions for a political agenda. There is no evident bias, misleading framing, or persuasive intent. The 5% likelihood acknowledges minor emotional phrasing, but this is typical of journalistic storytelling and falls far short of systemic propaganda. Sources (e.g., Columbus Dispatch, Reuters) and contextual facts (e.g., domestic violence history, gun laws) reinforce neutrality.
