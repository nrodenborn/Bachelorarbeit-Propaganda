### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation*: The text does not use direct insulting labels (e.g., "crooked," "traitor") against Hillary Clinton or Obama. It alleges wrongdoing but avoids explicit name-calling.  

2. **Repetition** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: The Uranium One deal, bribery, and Russian influence are repeatedly emphasized (e.g., "Uranium One deal," "bribery," "Russian executives," "Clinton Foundation").  

3. **Slogans** – No  
   *Explanation*: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Lock her up!") are used. The text relies on detailed accusations.  

4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: Highlights national security threats (e.g., "Russians control of part of the US uranium supply," "treason"), implying dire consequences from Clinton/Obama actions.  

5. **Doubt** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: Questions credibility of Obama, Clinton, and Democrats (e.g., "Democrats have unsurprisingly questioned Campbell's credibility," "Of course, we know what Obama did with his daily briefings. They are somewhere in the White House sewer system").  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: Exaggerates Obama’s handling of briefings ("White House sewer system") and minimizes APCO’s defense of their work with Russia.  

7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: Appeals to patriotism via the U.S. Constitution (quoted in intro) and national security (e.g., "treason," "US uranium supply").  

8. **Loaded Language** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: Uses emotionally charged terms like "bribery," "treason," "nefarious actions," "shoo-in," and "land grabs" to provoke outrage.  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *Explanation*: No comparisons to Nazis or Hitler.  

10. **Bandwagon** – No  
    *Explanation*: No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees"). Focuses on individual testimony.  

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes  
    *Explanation*: Blames Clinton/Obama approval for enabling Russian control of uranium, ignoring complex factors (e.g., CFIUS multi-agency approval).  

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No  
    *Explanation*: The text is specific (e.g., names, payments, timelines). No deliberate vagueness.  

13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes  
    *Explanation*: Relies on Campbell as an FBI/CIA informant and quotes from his attorney, Victoria Toensing, to validate claims.  

14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes  
    *Explanation*: Frames the issue as "clear bribery/treason vs. excuses," ignoring middle-ground explanations (e.g., APCO’s rebuttal).  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes  
    *Explanation*: Uses phrases like "clear bribery" and "all we ever get is excuses" to shut down counterarguments.  

16. **Red herring** – Yes  
    *Explanation*: Irrelevant mention of "land grabs" by the Bureau of Land Management and Oregon occupation to distract from the core Uranium One allegations.  

17. **Straw men** – No  
    *Explanation*: Accusations align with the presented evidence; no misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  

18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    *Explanation*: Does not accuse critics of hypocrisy (e.g., "What about X scandal?").

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 80% –** The text is highly likely propaganda. It employs multiple techniques (e.g., **appeal to fear**, **loaded language**, **causal oversimplification**, **repetition**) to advance a narrative of Clinton/Obama corruption tied to Russia. Key indicators include:  
- **Selective evidence**: Highlights Campbell’s testimony while downplaying exculpatory details (e.g., APCO’s denial of connections to Uranium One).  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Uses charged terms ("treason," "bribery") and conflates the Uranium One deal with unrelated issues (BLM land grabs).  
- **Bias and framing**: Presents allegations as fact (e.g., "clear bribery") and dismisses opposing views as "excuses."  
- **Lack of neutrality**: Omits context (e.g., CFIUS approval involved 9 agencies, not just Clinton) and uses sarcasm ("White House sewer system") to discredit Obama.  
While based on real events, the text’s one-sided, sensationalized delivery aims to provoke outrage rather than inform objectively, fitting propaganda criteria. The 20% uncertainty reflects the presence of factual elements (e.g., indictments, Campbell’s role), though their presentation is manipulative.
