1. Name calling – Yes – The text describes the official investigation with insulting labels such as "gross negligence," a "massive cover-up," and a "completely botched investigation."
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the central claim that the authorities failed to account for a victim, using phrases like "failed to record the death," "failed to catalogue at least one deceased victim," and "official report failed to catalogue the dead woman."
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable, or catchy phrases in a repeated manner.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear and distrust in authorities by suggesting that the FBI and police are engaged in a "massive cover-up" related to a mass murder, implying that the official story cannot be trusted and that the truth is being hidden from the public.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire purpose of the article is to question the credibility of the official investigation, highlighted by the concluding questions: "How was this victim overlooked by investigators but known by Intellihub?" and "How many more victims went ignored by investigators?"
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by framing a single alleged discrepancy as proof of a "massive cover-up" and a "completely botched investigation," amplifying its significance.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases intended to provoke a response, such as "gross negligence," "massive cover-up," "lifeless body," and "What in the Hell is going on here?"
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its claims are true because they are popular or widely believed.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes a potential discrepancy in a complex and chaotic mass casualty investigation to a simple and sinister cause: a "massive cover-up" or "gross negligence," ignoring other more plausible explanations like administrative error.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text introduces the detail about debris being kicked up by a potential "helicopter hovering overhead," a vague element that is not fully connected to the central claim about the victim but serves to create a general atmosphere of conspiracy.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents media figures (Tucker Carlson) and its own publication (Intellihub, Shepard Ambellas) as authorities and uses their reporting as the primary evidence for its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The opening sentence presents only two extreme negative options to explain the situation: "gross negligence or a massive cover-up," ignoring all other possibilities.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down debate.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces irrelevant information that distracts from the central claim, such as Sean Hannity getting a haircut in the same parking lot, which serves only to add a sense of strangeness and disrespect to the scene without proving anything about the victim count.
17. Straw men – No – The text attacks the official report for an omission but does not misrepresent or refute a specific argument made by its opponents.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse its target of hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated events.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary goal is not to report facts objectively but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, conspiratorial viewpoint. It employs a vast array of propaganda techniques, including loaded language, appeal to fear, and causal oversimplification, to create an emotional response of outrage and suspicion against the LVMPD and FBI. The piece opens with a black & white fallacy ("gross negligence or a massive cover-up") and is framed with the sensational headline "PROOF," presenting its claims as definitive truth rather than allegations to be investigated. It relies on appeals to its own authority (Intellihub) and introduces red herrings (the helicopter, Hannity's haircut) to create an atmosphere of conspiracy rather than providing clear, verifiable evidence. This stands in stark contrast to journalistic principles of objectivity, verification, and avoidance of emotional manipulation.
