Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Trump calls the Mueller investigation a "Rigged Witch Hunt" and refers to Mueller's team as "17 Angry Democrats... a disgrace to USA".
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – While "Rigged Witch Hunt" is used twice, the core message is not repeated obsessively throughout the text. The article reports different statements and aspects.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Rigged Witch Hunt" is a brief, memorable phrase used by Trump to label the investigation.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Trump claims the investigation will "stain our country any further," invoking fear of national damage to support his call to end it.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Trump explicitly questions the investigation's premise: "Where is the Russian Collusion?" and casts doubt on Mueller's credibility ("totally conflicted").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Trump exaggerates the treatment of Paul Manafort by comparing it to that of Al Capone. Giuliani minimizes the significance of Trump's tweets ("they don’t amount to anything").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Trump labels the Mueller team "a disgrace to USA" and claims the investigation will "stain our country," appealing directly to patriotism.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Phrases like "Rigged Witch Hunt," "stain our country," "Angry Democrats," "disgrace to USA," and "dirty work" are emotionally charged and rely on negative stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No attempt is made to link the investigation or its supporters to groups hated by the audience (e.g., Nazis, terrorists).
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – There is no explicit appeal to the popularity of the idea of stopping the probe or suggestion that "everyone" agrees with Trump on this point within the quoted text.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – While the text discusses complex legal and political issues (obstruction, recusal), no specific instance simplifies a complex cause to a single factor according to the definition. Trump blames bias but doesn't present it as a singular, simple cause for the entire probe.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The statements quoted (Trump, Schiff, Giuliani, Dershowitz, Vladeck) are relatively clear in their meaning, even if controversial. The reporting is straightforward.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Giuliani defends Trump by appealing to the authority of the Constitution ("First Amendment right of free speech"). Trump also quotes Alan Dershowitz (a Harvard Law professor) to support his criticism.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – The text presents various perspectives (Trump, Schiff, Giuliani, Dershowitz, Vladeck) and nuances (e.g., the difference between "should" and "must", discussions on what constitutes obstruction). No false dichotomy is presented.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – While slogans like "Rigged Witch Hunt" are used, the text itself reports extensive discussion, debate, and critical analysis from multiple sources about the implications of Trump's statements and the nature of obstruction, rather than shutting down thought.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The focus remains on Trump's tweets, the Mueller probe, Sessions' recusal, and the question of obstruction. While Manafort's trial is mentioned as context, it doesn't introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main topic.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – No one quoted in the text is shown refuting an argument significantly weaker or different than what was actually presented by their opponents. Arguments are addressed directly (e.g., Giuliani/Dershowitz countering the obstruction claim based on the nature of the tweets).
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No one in the quoted text charges an opponent with hypocrisy as a deflection tactic (e.g., "What about Hillary's emails?" isn't used).

**Verdict – 10% –** The text itself is a news report by the Los Angeles Times. Its primary function is to report on events (Trump's tweets) and present reactions and analysis from various figures (Trump, Schiff, Giuliani, Dershowitz, Vladeck). While it *reports on* statements made by Donald Trump that heavily employ propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority), the *article* is not itself propaganda. It presents multiple viewpoints, provides context (Sessions' recusal, Manafort trial), includes counter-arguments (Schiff's accusation, legal experts' opinions), and attributes information clearly. It fulfills the role of journalism by informing readers about a significant political event and the surrounding debate. The low percentage reflects the presence of reported propaganda within the subject matter, not the nature of the reporting itself.
