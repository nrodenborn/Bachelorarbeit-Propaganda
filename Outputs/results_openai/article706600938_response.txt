Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to persuade the audience to view Pope Francis negatively and to lend credibility to the idea that he could be the "destroyer" prophesied by Saint Francis. The presence of these techniques, particularly the appeal to fear and authority, suggests a high likelihood that the text is propaganda aimed at influencing the reader's perception of the current papacy.
