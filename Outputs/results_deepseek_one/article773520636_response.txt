### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "biblically illiterate," "perverse, modern-day, professing Christians," "tyrant." These are insulting labels attacking opponents.  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Absolutely not!" repeated 5 times to emphasize rejection of submission to corrupt authorities.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "No King but King Jesus," "REBELLION TO TYRANTS IS OBEDIENCE TO GOD." Memorable phrases reinforcing the core message.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warns that submitting to tyranny equals "resisting God" (e.g., "submit to the tyrants and resist God"), invoking eternal consequences.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions opponents' credibility: "this individual knows nothing," "biblically illiterates," "ignorant and uneducated."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates opponents' ignorance ("knows nothing of history"), minimizes their arguments as "twisting Scripture like Satan."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to American identity: Founding Fathers, Declaration of Independence, "We the People," and Christian duty ("Resistance to tyranny becomes the Christian duty").  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotionally charged terms: "tyrant," "corrupt," "usurpations," "perverse," "evil," "wicked."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Appeals to historical/religious popularity: Founding Fathers, biblical heroes (Moses, Daniel), and martyrs as models to follow.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Reduces societal issues to "submitting to tyrants" versus "obeying God," ignoring complex governance nuances.  
12. **Obfuscation** – **No** – Arguments are passionate but not deliberately vague; scripture and history are cited explicitly.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Uses Bible quotes, Founding Fathers (John Hancock), and legal figures (Blackstone) as irrefutable evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents only two options: resist tyranny (good) or submit to evil (bad). Ignores nuanced obedience.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Absolutely not!" and "Nowhere!" shut down debate on submitting to authority.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Distracts with tangential biblical stories (e.g., Moses, Daniel) instead of directly engaging with Romans 13 context.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Misrepresents opponents as teaching "submit to evil" (e.g., "submit to those who lie, steal, kill"), ignoring their likely nuanced interpretation of Romans 13.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Focuses on historical/biblical defiance of authority without accusing specific opponents of hypocrisy.

### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Persuasive Intent**: It aims to radicalize readers against political/religious opponents by framing dissent as a divine mandate.  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses fear (eternal consequences), anger ("tyrants," "corrupt"), and pride (patriotism/Christian identity) to override critical analysis.  
3. **Distortion of Opposition**: Relies on straw men (e.g., accusing opponents of endorsing evil) and name-calling ("illiterates") to discredit rather than engage.  
4. **Selective Evidence**: Cherry-picks scripture/history (e.g., revolutionary slogans, biblical defiance) while ignoring counterexamples (e.g., New Testament calls for peaceable submission).  
5. **Binary Framing**: Reduces a complex theological/political issue (Romans 13) to a false dilemma: rebel or collaborate with evil.  
6. **Repetitive Reinforcement**: Key slogans and phrases ("Absolutely not!") are drilled to cement ideology.  

While the text cites legitimate sources (Bible, Founding Fathers), its **primary goal is not discourse but recruitment** into an ideological stance by demonizing opponents and glorifying rebellion. The absence of nuance, escalation of rhetoric, and reliance on emotional triggers align with propaganda objectives. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges its use of factual references, though these are weaponized for persuasion.
