Name calling – Yes – The text quotes and supports the labeling of migrants as criminals: "The assault on our country at our Southern Border, including the Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in..."

Repetition – Yes – The poll question is repeated three times in a row: "Will the Democrats try to impeach President Trump now that they control the House?"

Slogans – Yes – The text quotes a brief, memorable phrase from Trump's tweet, presented in all caps for emphasis: "CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!"

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text aims to instill fear by describing the caravan as an "assault on our country" and warning of "Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in."

Doubt – Yes – The author questions the president's resolve and credibility: "If they make it here and Trump does nothing but arrest them and put them through the system rather than simply turning them away, then you know the words are empty and hollow."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text makes the unsubstantiated and extreme claim that "every single migrant who crosses over into our country will more than likely commit at least 28 crimes in order to present themselves as legal."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the situation as an "assault on our country" and questioning the constitutionality of foreign aid payments: "They are unconstitutional and neither Congress nor you have the authority to give American's money to these countries."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "assault" and "onslaught" to describe the migrant caravan and "disaster" to describe the USMCA trade deal.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct simply because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue by quoting and agreeing with the statement: "All Democrats fault for weak laws!"

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The claim that "every single migrant who crosses over into our country will more than likely commit at least 28 crimes" is presented as a fact but is completely unsubstantiated and vague, with no explanation of what these crimes are or where the number comes from.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents Donald Trump as an authority whose statements are inherently correct: "In a series of tweets on Thursday, President Trump said the right things."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The author presents only two outcomes for Trump's actions regarding the caravan: either he turns them away, or his "words are empty and hollow," ignoring a wide range of other possible policy actions and outcomes.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text concludes with a cliché that discourages further thought: "Time will tell what will take place."

Red herring – Yes – The article, which is about a migrant caravan, abruptly introduces an unrelated poll to distract the reader: "Will the Democrats try to impeach President Trump now that they control the House?"

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that was not presented by claiming Democrats "want Open Borders," a caricature of their position used to make it easier to attack: "I am watching the Democrat Party led (because they want Open Borders and existing weak laws) assault on our country..."

Whataboutism – No – The text attacks opponents but does not use the specific technique of deflecting criticism by accusing them of hypocrisy on another matter.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. While it is structured around a real news event and includes factual elements (such as quoting tweets and a Reuters report), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly emotional, and partisan viewpoint. The article employs a vast array of propaganda techniques—15 out of the 18 listed—to achieve this goal. It uses loaded language ("assault," "onslaught") and appeals to fear ("CRIMINALS," "DRUGS") to create a sense of crisis. It then provides a simple, blame-oriented cause ("All Democrats fault") and a simple solution ("CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!"). The inclusion of a red herring poll about impeachment serves to further entrench a partisan mindset and distract from the topic at hand. The author's own commentary reinforces the propaganda by presenting extreme exaggerations as fact ("will more than likely commit at least 28 crimes") and casting doubt on whether the political leader is being tough enough, pushing the reader towards an even more extreme position. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a deliberate effort to manipulate emotion and shut down critical thought in favor of a predetermined conclusion.
