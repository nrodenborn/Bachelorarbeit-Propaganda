1. Name calling – Yes – The text attacks the opponents' character and ideology with insulting labels, for example: "he is not even fit to sit on the bench," and "...that's a Communist ideology you are seeing there, not an American one."

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times in a row.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate its message; it relies on longer-form arguments and attacks.

4. Appeal to fear – No – The text primarily appeals to anger and a sense of violated rights rather than instilling fear of a specific alternative outcome.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text consistently questions the credibility and competence of the judge and the attorneys general, stating, "he is demonstrating he is not even fit to sit on the bench, and the attorney generals of each of these states are demonstrating they are not fit to be in the office they are in."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses extreme exaggeration by comparing those who oppose the gun plans to people who support "mothers hiring hitmen to murder their babies in their wombs in the most brutal and barbaric fashion."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a defense of the US Constitution and American values against a foreign "Communist ideology."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words intended to influence the reader, such as "frivolous lawsuit," "brutal and barbaric fashion," "murder their babies," and "violates."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of the opposition's legal reasoning by associating it with a hated group, stating, "...but that's a Communist ideology you are seeing there, not an American one."

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular; instead, it frames its side as fighting against powerful institutions.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex legal challenge to a simple cause, such as the judge being "not even fit to sit on the bench" or the opponents having a "Communist ideology," rather than engaging with the nuanced legal arguments.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's position and arguments, while biased, are presented directly and clearly, not with intentional vagueness.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the Constitution, "our founders," and the "Creator" as ultimate authorities to validate its argument. For example: "Since our founders clearly said that our rights come from our Creator, and the Second Amendment acknowledges that the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed'..."

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the issue as a simple choice between upholding the Constitution (the "American one") and succumbing to a "Communist ideology," ignoring any potential for legal nuance or middle ground.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases to dismiss dissent and discourage critical thought, such as, "This federal judge should know what the Constitution actually says and should have tossed this frivolous lawsuit in the trash where it belongs," which shuts down any consideration of the judge's actual legal reasoning.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces irrelevant material to distract the audience. The most blatant example is the repeated poll, "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?", which has no connection to the 3D-printed gun case.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that was not presented by linking opposition to gun plans with a graphic and extreme caricature of abortion supporters: "It makes perfect sense when you have the same people who have absolutely no problem with mothers hiring hitmen to murder their babies..." This attacks a fabricated position to make the opposition seem monstrous.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges opponents with hypocrisy on an unrelated issue to deflect from the topic at hand. The long paragraph on abortion is a clear example, implying, "How can you worry about 3D-printed guns when you (supposedly) support this other, worse thing?"

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It is not a piece of objective journalism but a highly persuasive article designed to provoke an emotional response and solidify a specific, partisan viewpoint. The author employs a vast array of propaganda techniques, often layering them for maximum effect. Instead of presenting a balanced view of the legal conflict, the text systematically attacks the character, intelligence, and ideology of the opposition (Name Calling, Doubt, Reduction ad Hitlerum). It uses emotionally charged and exaggerated language (Loaded Language, Exaggeration) to create outrage, particularly in the graphic and irrelevant comparison to abortion (Straw Men, Whataboutism, Red Herring). The core arguments are framed as a simplistic battle between American constitutional purity and a "Communist ideology" (Flag-Waving, Black & White Fallacy), dismissing complex legal arguments as mere incompetence or malice (Causal Oversimplification, Thought-terminating clichés). The inclusion of a completely unrelated political poll (Red Herring) further underscores that the article's purpose is not to inform but to influence and rally a specific political base. While it contains factual elements (quoting the judge's order, listing the states involved), these facts serve as a launchpad for a barrage of propagandistic attacks rather than a foundation for neutral analysis.
