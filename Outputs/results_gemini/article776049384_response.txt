1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses insulting labels such as 'swarmy power brokers,' 'lavender mafia,' and refers to Cardinal McCarrick as 'McCarrick, the Molester' and Pope Francis as 'the clever and tyrannical Bergoglio.'

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly refers to Cardinal McCarrick as 'McCarrick the Molester' and reiterates the idea that a 'homosexual agenda' is being pushed by a 'lavender mafia' to 'reform the Church.'

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the hashtag '#StopTheSynod' as a brief, memorable phrase to encapsulate its main call to action.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by warning that the Synod will 'exploit the youth, like they’ve been doing for the last 60 years' and that failure to act will lead to 'another precious child is exploited, a holy seminarian is violated, or another homosexual orgy is covered up at the Vatican.'

5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively seeks to cast doubt on the credibility of Church leaders, stating, 'The Bishops have proven that they cannot be trusted to protect young people' and 'Catholics must shed their trust and naivety in the papacy and bishops’ conference.'

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the potential impact of the Synod, claiming it 'will destroy the future of the Church' and describes the situation as the 'cascading revelations of papal sex scandals are toppling the barque of Peter.'

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the identity of its target audience, 'faithful Catholics,' with phrases like, 'Will the laity step up and reclaim our hijacked Catholic Church?' and calling for them to 'protect the Church.'

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged and stereotypical language, such as 'swarmy power brokers,' 'notorious lavender mafia,' 'tyrannical Bergoglio,' 'nightmare of a "sinod",' and 'prissy, pop psycho speak.'

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of Pope Francis and his allies by suggesting their ideas are popular with a group presented as hateful to the audience (the 'lavender mafia' and 'gay-friendly' figures). It notes Francis 'landed on the cover of the Advocate, the gay magazine, as its Man of the Year' to link him to a group the author expects the audience to dislike.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text implies a growing movement of discontent that the reader should join, asking 'Will Catholic laity pay attention and take action?' and stating 'We are no longer Shocked, just fed up,' suggesting a collective sentiment the reader should share.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex event of Pope Francis's election and his entire papacy to a single, simple cause: a 'pre-Conclave Bergoglio plot' by the 'notorious lavender mafia' to 'advance its reformist homosexual agenda.'

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague, conspiratorial terms like 'St. Gallen Mafia' and refers to an unnamed 'very interesting and influential Italian gentleman' to imply a shadowy plot without providing concrete, verifiable evidence.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text concludes by identifying the author, Elizabeth Yore, as 'an attorney and international child rights advocate who has investigated clergy sex abuse cases,' using her professional background to lend authority and credibility to the article's claims.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark choice: either the laity 'step up and reclaim our hijacked Catholic Church' or it will be destroyed by a 'radical hijacking.' It allows for no middle ground or alternative interpretations of the events.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like 'the chickens have come home to roost' and 'McCarrick is the last straw' to shut down nuanced discussion and present its conclusions as obvious and inevitable.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a quote from Queen Elizabeth ('annus horribilis') and a hashtag like '#bromance.' These elements are irrelevant to the core argument and serve to distract and add emotional flavor rather than logical substance.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the stated purpose of the Synod on Youth, reframing it as a plot to 'exploit the youth' and push a 'homosexual agenda.' It then attacks this distorted version of the Synod's purpose, rather than its actual stated goals.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges the Church hierarchy with hypocrisy, for example by stating, 'If it weren’t so infuriating, it would be laughable that following the McCarrick scandal of sexual predation of young males and seminarians, by a Cardinal, and covered up by Bishops, the Catholic Church would host a Synod of Bishops on the topic of young people and vocations!'

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the reader by provoking strong emotional reactions of fear, anger, and disgust. It employs a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. The piece constructs a simple, conspiratorial narrative of a 'hijacked' Church, using loaded language ('lavender mafia', 'swarmy'), name-calling ('McCarrick the Molester'), and causal oversimplification (blaming everything on a 'homosexual agenda') to frame the issue. It presents a black-and-white world where the reader must join a righteous cause ('#StopTheSynod') to fight a corrupt and evil enemy. The entire tone, structure, and vocabulary are geared towards emotional manipulation and a call to action, rather than objective, factual reporting, making it a textbook example of propaganda.
