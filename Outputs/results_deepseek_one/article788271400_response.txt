Below is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the provided text, followed by the final verdict:

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "apologists" (referring to police supporters) and "repugnant and outright disrespectful move" (describing Cruz's actions).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "she killed an innocent man" repeated 3 times to reinforce guilt.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL" equivalent).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No attempt to instill fear about alternatives; focuses on condemning existing actions.  
5. **Doubt** – No – The text asserts certainty (e.g., "This is a fact"), not doubt.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes Cruz's stance as "simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time" to dismiss his argument.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "repugnant," "disrespectful," "pillar of society," "smear campaign," "horrifically flawed system" to evoke outrage.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified cause (e.g., acknowledges systemic issues like bias).  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Language is direct, not vague or confusing.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No cited authorities (only references Cruz/O’Rourke as opponents).  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Frames the issue as purely "right versus wrong" with no middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – Stays focused on the case; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Distorts Cruz’s position: Cruz urged against rushing judgment, but the text claims he called it "simply a case of being in the wrong place."  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Uses role reversal: "If it was Botham Jean... killing [Guyger]—would police... write it off?" to accuse Cruz of hypocrisy.

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 85% –** The text extensively employs loaded language, name-calling, repetition, exaggeration/minimization, black-and-white framing, straw man arguments, and whataboutism to vilify Ted Cruz and amplify outrage over Botham Jean’s killing. It selectively presents facts (e.g., Guyger’s admission) while dismissing alternative perspectives as biased ("apologists," "blue line"). The emotional tone ("repugnant," "tragedy"), us-vs-them narrative ("right vs. wrong"), and call to action (demanding Guyger’s firing) align with persuasive propaganda aimed at shaping reader opinion against Cruz and police accountability. However, it avoids techniques like obfuscation or fear appeals, and its basis in factual events (Guyger killed Jean) prevents a 100% rating.  

**Key propaganda indicators**:  
- **Persuasive intent**: Clearly advocates for Guyger’s firing and systemic reform.  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Uses charged language to provoke anger.  
- **Bias**: Omits Cruz’s call for due process ("if a jury finds... consequences"), framing it as apologia.  
- **Selective framing**: Highlights Jean’s innocence and police "smear campaign" while downplaying investigation complexities.
