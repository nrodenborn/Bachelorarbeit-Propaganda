1. Name calling – No – The text does not attack the school or its officials with insulting labels. It criticizes their actions and questions their motives, but does not use direct name-calling.

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question, “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is repeated three times in a row.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the typical sense of a slogan.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear that public schools are systematically forcing children to accept Islam. The headline, “West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah,” is designed to be alarming to a non-Muslim audience.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the credibility of the school officials. For example: “Then when administrators are confronted, they claim it was all just an educational exercise, not proselytizing.” and “Penkoski and his daughter, Brielle, contested Branch’s claims.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline, “Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah,” exaggerates a calligraphy assignment by framing it as a forced act of religious conversion.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the religious identity of its presumed audience by framing the issue as a conflict between Christianity and Islam within the public school system, as seen in the quote from the “Christian Parent Furious After School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language. The phrase “submission to Allah” is a literal translation but is used in a way that is loaded with negative connotations for the intended audience, implying forced conversion rather than an academic exercise.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparison to Hitler, the Nazis, or any other similarly hated group.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The phrase, “We see this again and again,” suggests that this is a widespread and recognized problem, encouraging the reader to join the supposedly growing number of people who are concerned about it.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text implies a simple, sinister cause for the incident, suggesting a deliberate agenda to promote Islam over other religions (“For some reason, this form of educational exercise is only ever used regarding Islam. Now, why is that?”), ignoring other more complex possibilities like a teacher’s poor judgment or curriculum design flaws.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is not vague; it makes very direct accusations. It accuses the school officials of using obfuscation, but does not employ the technique itself.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article presents Robert Spencer and the Geller Report, figures of authority for the target audience, as the source of the story (“Article posted with permission from Robert Spencer,” “thanks to the Geller Report”). It also positions the parent, Rich Penkoski, as an authority through his role as the “founder of online ministry Warriors for Christ.”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as one of two options: either the school is maliciously proselytizing for Islam, or it is innocently teaching world religions. It heavily discredits the latter, leaving only the sinister option. For instance: “But we never, ever see Judaism or Christianity... taught as fact in public schools,” creating a stark contrast that implies Islam is uniquely and deliberately being taught as fact.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down discussion.

16. Red herring – Yes – The poll, “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?”, is completely irrelevant to the story about the school assignment and serves only to distract and inject partisan politics into the issue.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes the idea that Islam is being “taught as fact,” a position the school never took. The school’s claim was that it was a calligraphy exercise in a world religions unit, but the text frames the debate around the straw man of “teaching Islam as fact” to make the school’s actions seem more nefarious.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges the school system with hypocrisy by repeatedly asking why Islam is treated differently from other religions. The line, “But we never, ever see Judaism or Christianity or Hinduism or Buddhism taught as fact in public schools,” is a direct use of whataboutism to deflect from the specifics of the lesson and allege a double standard.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast number of propaganda techniques not to inform, but to persuade the reader towards a specific, highly emotional, and political conclusion. The use of loaded language, appeal to fear, and exaggeration in the headline immediately frames the story in a biased way. The narrative systematically casts doubt on official sources while presenting the counter-narrative as undisputed fact. It uses logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy, straw man, and whataboutism to construct its argument. Most tellingly, the inclusion of a completely irrelevant and repetitive political poll (a red herring) reveals a clear intent to manipulate the reader by associating a local school issue with national partisan conflict. The piece is not an objective report but a carefully crafted article designed to stoke outrage and confirm a pre-existing bias.
