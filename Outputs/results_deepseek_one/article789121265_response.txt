Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "complete FRAUD" directed at Senator Durbin.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively in the poll section.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No distinct, brief, memorable phrase used as a rallying cry within the main article text. "Where was mine?" is rhetorical but not a slogan in the defined sense.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – Explanation: The text focuses on hypocrisy and injustice, not on instilling fear about specific alternatives or consequences.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Repeatedly questions the credibility and motives of Feinstein and other Democrats regarding their interest in Broaddrick's case vs. Ford's (e.g., "Where was mine?", "Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape Allegation", "they did not want to know about it", "You didn’t give a damn back then").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Describes Ford's accusations as "flimsy and meritless", minimizing their seriousness.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: No appeal to patriotism, national identity, or "us vs. them" based on national loyalty.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged words like "shut down", "paint her as a liar", "flimsy and meritless", "double standard", "didn’t give a damn", "complete FRAUD", "RAPE" (in caps).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: Does not appeal to the popularity of the idea being presented.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: Does not attribute a complex event to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is relatively direct and clear in its accusations and comparisons.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Relies heavily on Juanita Broaddrick's statements and perspective as the primary source and authority on the events and the Democrats' hypocrisy.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents the situation as a stark choice: either investigate both Broaddrick's old allegation and Ford's old allegation, or investigate neither ("If you want the FBI to go back that far... let’s investigate my RAPE allegations... Seems only fair."). Ignores potential contextual differences.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: No phrases used to shut down critical thought (e.g., "it's just common sense", "that's the way it is").
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The core argument (Democrat hypocrisy) is directly addressed through the comparison of the two cases. The poll distraction is irrelevant but is clearly separate filler.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text directly addresses the perceived actions and hypocrisy of the Democrats regarding the two allegations. It doesn't misrepresent Feinstein's position on Ford; it contrasts it with her (alleged) position on Broaddrick.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Explanation: Charges Democrats (Feinstein specifically) with hypocrisy by deflecting from the Kavanaugh/Ford allegation ("Where was mine?") and demanding equivalent investigation into the Clinton allegation ("If you want the FBI to go back that far... let’s investigate my RAPE allegations... Seems only fair.").

**Verdict – 85% –** Explanation: The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is not balanced reporting but to persuade the reader of Democratic hypocrisy regarding sexual assault allegations, specifically targeting Feinstein. This is achieved through **Loaded Language** ("liar", "flimsy and meritless", "FRAUD"), **Doubt** cast on Feinstein's motives and consistency, **Name-calling** ("FRAUD"), **Appeal to Authority** (Broaddrick's unchallenged narrative), the **Black & White Fallacy** (investigate both old cases or neither), and overt **Whataboutism** (deflecting from Ford/Kavanaugh by demanding investigation into Clinton). While it reports on statements and events (Broaddrick's accusations, Feinstein's support for Ford), the selection of facts, framing, and highly emotive language are designed to promote a specific, partisan narrative and discredit political opponents, making it strongly propagandistic. The embedded poll repetition further supports this aim by using engagement tactics common in partisan media. The permission note from Pamela Geller, a known controversial figure, also signals the likely ideological slant.
