1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack ideas, such as calling the blessing of a homosexual couple an “atrocity” and describing the Church’s adaptation to the modern world as a “suicidal modernization.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The central message that Church doctrine is absolute and that modern interpretations are wrong is repeated through the quotes from Cardinal Müller, Archbishop Zvolensy, and Professor Melina, all reinforcing the same core argument against change.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable, and impactful phrases like “suicidal modernization” and “atrocity at a holy site” to encapsulate a strong negative judgment.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that differing interpretations of Church teaching will lead to “chaotic conditions” and a situation “like the one before the Reformation,” instilling fear of schism and disorder.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text is structured to cast doubt on the theological soundness of “new initiatives coming from Germany, especially from Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode,” as well as theologians who support “situation ethics.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by describing the blessing of a couple as an “atrocity” and a potential schism as being like the “Reformation,” which are extreme characterizations of the events.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific Catholic identity by invoking “the Truth of God,” the “Magisterium of the Church,” and what “Christ Himself willed,” framing the argument as a defense of the faith itself.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the audience, such as “atrocity,” “suicidal,” “submissive change,” and “chaotic conditions.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of an idea by associating it with a figure hated by the target audience. It criticizes modern ideas by linking them to “Martin Luther's own denial of man's free will,” using Luther as a negative figure for a traditional Catholic audience.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to popularity. In fact, it argues against popular modern trends and new initiatives, positioning its view as a principled stand against the majority.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests that differing interpretations of a papal text are the simple cause that will lead to a complex outcome like “chaotic conditions” or a schism similar to the Reformation, ignoring many other contributing factors.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – While the text uses specialized theological language, the arguments presented by the speakers are direct and clear in their meaning for the intended audience. There is no evidence of intentional vagueness to confuse.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The entire article is built on appeals to authority, citing Cardinal Müller (former Vatican doctrine chief), Pope John Paul II’s encyclical *Veritatis Splendor*, Archbishop Zvolensy, and Professor Melina to validate its position.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: adhering to a single, “orthodox” interpretation of Church teaching or succumbing to a “suicidal modernization” that leads to “chaotic conditions.”

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that discourage critical thought, such as “In dogmatic questions, there cannot be a plurality,” which is stated as an absolute fact to shut down any debate on alternative interpretations.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the topic of Martin Luther’s theology on free will, which, while loosely related to morality, serves as a distraction from the central contemporary issues of blessing homosexual couples and interpreting *Amoris Laetitia*.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a distorted version of the opposing argument by claiming those who want to adapt the Church seek a “submissive change of the Church into a NGO for the embetterment of the this-worldly life conditions,” an uncharitable caricature of their position.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes opponents and their ideas but does not deflect criticism by accusing them of hypocrisy with a "what about..." argument.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it reports on statements actually made by a public figure, its construction goes far beyond neutral reporting. The article is from a source with a clear editorial viewpoint (LifeSiteNews) and selectively frames the information to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, partisan stance within an internal Church debate. The overwhelming use of 15 out of the 18 listed propaganda techniques—including loaded language, appeal to fear, black & white fallacies, and straw men—demonstrates a clear intent to influence opinion, rally support for one side, and delegitimize opposing views rather than to inform objectively.
