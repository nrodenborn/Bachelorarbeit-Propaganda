Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in "The Eerie Silence":

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Russia-gate **freaks** like Congressman Adam Schiff and Mike Pompeo" (Labels opponents with an insulting term). "**corrupt media**" (Insulting label).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The concept of "**silence**" (especially "eerie silence") regarding Assange's plight is repeated throughout Pilger's statement and the interview ("The silence is Julian Assange", "Only the silence of good people will allow them to win", "eerie silence around the Julian Assange case", "silence about Julian", "silence among many who call themselves left").
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "**Only the silence of good people will allow them to win.**" (A brief, memorable phrase encapsulating the core call to action).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "ending up in a **hell hole**", "arrested, extradited to the United States", "**execute**d", "**destroyed** the man", "**torture**", "**persecution**" (Instills fear about Assange's fate if not supported).
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "**witch-hunting** around Russia-gate!", "Their investigations turned up **not a shred of real evidence**", "**bogus smear**", "**bogus Swedish case**", "**fakery** of Russia-gate" (Questions the credibility of investigations, accusations, and media reporting).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – *Exaggeration:* "**hanged from the rafters in Congress**" (Hyperbole about potential punishment). *Minimization:* "what happened to Sanders... **everybody knows that this is the story**" (Downplays the complexity and evidence around Russia-gate by implying the DNC sabotage is the *only* obvious story). "**just nonsense**" (Minimizing the concept of Russian meddling).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "**freedom of speech**, about **our right to know**, which is **enshrined in the United States Constitution**", "Julian would be a **constitutional hero**" (Appeals to patriotism and core American values).
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Pervasive use of emotionally charged or value-laden terms: "**rapacious power**", "**raw truth**", "**shame**", "**vindictive delight**", "**tormenting**", "**persecution**", "**torture**", "**wickedly experimental munitions**", "**hell hole**", "**collusion**", "**betrayed**", "**sucking up**", "**dark and menacing developments**", "**blighted**", "**brutalized**", "**cowardice**", "**criminality**", "**enemies**", "**subversion**", "**distorted reporting**", "**courage**", "**horrific examples**", "**amazing contribution**".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – While opponents are demonized (e.g., "corrupt media", "Russia-gate freaks"), there's no direct comparison to Hitler or universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Implied: "the streets outside the embassy... **should be full of people** saying that we are with you", "people **should rally** to quickly", "he should also have made a **huge number of friends**" (Appeals to the idea that people *should* support Assange, implying it's the right/popular thing to do).
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – "**Only the silence of good people will allow them to win.**" (Attributes the potential victory of Assange's opponents solely to public silence, ignoring complex legal, political, and diplomatic factors). Blaming Assange's isolation primarily on media "**silence**" oversimplifies the multifaceted reasons.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – "**dark and menacing developments**" (Vague, unclear what specific developments are meant). "**this is not a part of the story!**" (Vague reference to "pissed-off people" working for Clinton, presented as the obvious alternative explanation without concrete evidence).
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – John Pilger is presented as an expert voice throughout the interview ("a close friend and supporter of Assange", "I have never known anything like it in my career"), lending weight to the arguments. References to Rafael Correa and the UN Working Party on Unlawful Detentions also serve as appeals to authority.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as a clear battle between truth/justice (Assange, WikiLeaks, Pilger, Credico) vs. lies/corruption/persecution (US government, UK government, Ecuador's Moreno govt, mainstream media like NYT/WaPo/Guardian, Adam Schiff, Mike Pompeo). Assange is either a "**constitutional hero**" or facing execution; media is either truthful or engaged in "**witch-hunting**" and "**distorted reporting**".
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "**right to know**" (Used repeatedly as an ultimate justification, potentially discouraging deeper discussion of *how* this right is balanced with other concerns like national security or privacy). "**raw truth**" (Implies WikiLeaks releases are pure, unmediated truth, discouraging critical evaluation of context or potential bias).
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The lengthy diversion into the Israel-Palestine conflict ("**collusion when it comes to Israel**", "**gunning down of over 60 people**", "**Nakba**", "**right of return**", "**immunity**") is largely irrelevant to the central topic of Julian Assange's situation and serves to associate his opponents (US/UK govt, media) with another widely condemned action.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – "**They want to get behind Russia-gate freaks... who would like to see Assange in jail forever or even executed.**" (Presents an extreme, likely non-representative view of *all* journalists who don't support Assange). Portraying the media's position solely as "**witch-hunting**" and "**vindictive delight in tormenting Julian**" misrepresents more nuanced criticisms of Assange/WikiLeaks.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – "**what about Judith Miller and The New York Times lying the West into war?**" (Deflects criticism of Assange/WikiLeaks by pointing to the hypocrisy or wrongdoing of others, specifically the media). The Gary Webb analogy ("**reminds me of the Gary Webb case**") also functions as a form of whataboutism, deflecting by comparing to another case of perceived media persecution.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs a wide array of propaganda techniques (at least 15 out of 18 identified) very effectively. Its primary purpose is not neutral reporting but passionate advocacy for Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, while fiercely attacking their perceived enemies (US/UK governments, specific politicians, mainstream media). Key indicators include:
*   **Heavy Use of Loaded Language:** The text is saturated with emotionally charged terms painting Assange as a heroic victim of persecution and his opponents as corrupt, torturous, and dishonest.
*   **Strong Appeals to Emotion (Fear, Outrage):** It vividly depicts Assange's potential dire fate and the "eerie silence" surrounding him to provoke fear and outrage, motivating support.
*   **"Us vs. Them" Framing (Black & White):** It starkly divides the world into heroes (Assange, WikiLeaks, Pilger, Credico, Manning) and villains (Schiff, Pompeo, NYT, WaPo, Guardian, Moreno, US/UK governments).
*   **Demonization of Opponents:** Uses name-calling ("freaks", "corrupt media"), doubt, and exaggeration to undermine the credibility and motives of critics.
*   **Simplification & Omission:** Oversimplifies complex issues like Russia-gate and the reasons for Assange's situation, while largely omitting any substantive counter-arguments or criticisms of Assange/WikiLeaks (e.g., concerns about source protection, selectivity of releases, potential collateral damage).
*   **Call to Action:** Includes explicit calls to break the "silence" and rally support ("people should rally to quickly").
*   **Reliance on Selective Authorities:** Bases its arguments heavily on the perspective of John Pilger, a known and dedicated supporter of Assange, without significant counterbalancing viewpoints.
While the text presents facts and events (Assange's confinement, Credico's interaction, UN ruling, specific leaks), these are framed and selected entirely to serve the persuasive goal of defending Assange and attacking his adversaries. The consistent, pervasive use of multiple propaganda techniques strongly indicates a propagandistic intent. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of factual elements, but their presentation is overwhelmingly shaped by propaganda.
