Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "acting like a child" (referring to Acosta), "strong, lying, propagandizing press" (referring to CNN).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" repeated 3 times in the poll.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "a free, strong and independent American press" (quoted from CNN's statement, then mocked).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No clear instillation of fear against alternatives.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "What? Due process? Wait, Acosta was not charged with a crime... There is no due process here" (questions validity of ruling).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "his badgering," "continual questioning" (exaggerates Acosta's conduct); "It’s not a big deal" (minimizes ruling's significance).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Weak/No – Patriotism/identity not overtly leveraged as a primary argument.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "badgering," "acting out of sorts," "lies," "propagandizing press" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – The poll implies majority opinion ("No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass") and references media outlets' support as questionable.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – "The Fifth Amendment has no business being brought up here. This is an issue of privilege, not rights" (reduces complex constitutional issue to simple privilege).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – "We’re doing that, we’re going to write them up" (vague on rules); "acting out of sorts" (undefined standard).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authoritative sources cited to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Poll options frame Acosta’s reinstatement as binary (yes/no), ignoring nuance.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Give me a break!" and "See how he likes them apples" (shuts down discussion).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – "So does Infowars. Will Judge Kelly demand...?" (diverts to unrelated issue).  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – "Today, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right" (misrepresents ruling, which focused on due process, not absolute access).  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – "I want my White House press pass! So does Infowars" (deflects by invoking hypocrisy in access standards).

---

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits pervasive use of propaganda techniques to discredit Jim Acosta, CNN, and the judicial ruling while promoting a singular narrative. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional manipulation** through loaded language ("lying, propagandizing press") and name-calling.  
- **Fallacious reasoning** via straw men (misrepresenting the ruling), whataboutism (Infowars comparison), and causal oversimplification (dismissing due process).  
- **Suppression of nuance** via black-and-white polling, thought-terminating clichés, and repetition of anti-Acosta messaging.  
- **Distraction tactics** like red herrings and obfuscation about new "rules."  
The framing is consistently one-sided, omitting legal context (e.g., due process applies beyond criminal charges), amplifying Acosta’s alleged misconduct, and portraying media integrity as partisan. While reporting factual events (e.g., Trump’s response), the commentary employs propagandistic methods to delegitimize opposition and rally readers against perceived media bias.
