1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels such as "Islamic Jew-hatred" to attack the subject's religion and, by extension, her character and views.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The poll question about using "military force to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border" is designed to instill fear about an approaching group of people.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire premise of the article, starting with the headline "Records Support Claims That Minnesota Muslima State Rep Ilhan Omar Married Her Brother," is intended to cast doubt on Ilhan Omar's character, honesty, and personal history.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text makes the sweeping claim that Omar's views "are mainstream in the Democrat Party today," exaggerating the position of one representative to encompass an entire political party.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or use patriotic symbols to make its case.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to evoke a strong negative reaction, such as "evil doings," "apartheid state," and "hateful views."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with Nazis or similar groups to discredit it.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular and that the reader should therefore agree with it.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simplistic cause for a complex issue by stating that because Ilhan Omar is a "hijab-wearing, devout Muslim," her views on Israel are a direct result of "Islamic Jew-hatred" which it claims "is in the Quran."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites an article by "David Steinberg, PJ Media" and notes it was posted with permission from "Pamela Geller" to lend authority and credibility to the claims being made.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents only two extreme options for a complex issue: "Yes, military force should be used" or "No, keep the military out of it," ignoring a wide range of other possible diplomatic or humanitarian responses.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; it makes strong statements to provoke a specific reaction.
16. Red herring – Yes – The main topic of the article is Ilhan Omar, but it abruptly introduces a poll about a "caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border," which is an unrelated and emotionally charged topic used to distract and inflame the reader.
17. Straw men – No – The text makes direct accusations rather than misrepresenting and then refuting an opponent's argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses on attacking its subject and does not deflect criticism by pointing out the hypocrisy of an opponent.

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. It employs a vast number of propaganda techniques (at least 10 of the 18 listed) to achieve its goal, which is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of Ilhan Omar, the Islamic faith, and the Democratic Party. The article uses loaded language, name-calling, and causal oversimplification to link Omar's political views directly to a negative stereotype of her religion. It then uses exaggeration to apply these views to the entire Democratic Party. Furthermore, it uses a red herring and an appeal to fear in the form of a poll about a migrant caravan—an issue completely unrelated to the article's main subject—to distract and stir up negative emotions in the reader. The reliance on emotional manipulation, logical fallacies, and the sheer density of propaganda techniques over objective reporting confirms its nature as propaganda.
