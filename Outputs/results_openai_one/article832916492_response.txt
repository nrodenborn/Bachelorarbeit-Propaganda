Verdict – 40% – The text shows some elements of propaganda, particularly through repetition and potential exaggeration of the situation as a "huge victory" for President Trump. Additionally, there is an appeal to authority by referencing multiple reports and officials to support the narrative. However, the text lacks other common propaganda techniques, and it primarily reports on the conclusion of the Mueller investigation without introducing irrelevant distractions or emotionally charged language. Therefore, while there are some indicators of propaganda, the likelihood is moderate.
