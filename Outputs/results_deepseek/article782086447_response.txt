### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 15/18 techniques to advance a singular narrative: Pope Francis and associates orchestrated a cover-up of McCarrick’s abuses, necessitating mass resignations. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language ("abominable crimes," "fetid swamp") and fear appeals (Church "strangled" by homosexual networks) dominate.  
- **Character Assassination**: Name-calling ("corrupt," "pervert," "deviated") targets opponents while exalting critics (e.g., Benedict XVI).  
- **Selective Evidence**: Cherry-picks events (e.g., McCarrick’s meeting with Francis) while omitting counter-evidence or context.  
- **False Dichotomies**: Demands "zero tolerance" resignations, framing dissent as moral imperative.  
- **Conspiracy Framing**: Repetition of "conspiracy of silence" and "homosexual networks" implies coordinated malfeasance.  
- **Authority Subversion**: Uses appeals to doctrine/former popes to delegitimize Francis while dismissing his statements (e.g., on transparency).  

The text’s goal is not impartial analysis but to mobilize outrage against Church leadership. Its one-sidedness, emotional urgency, and systematic use of persuasive techniques place it firmly in the realm of propaganda. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges the gravity of the abuse allegations, which could warrant forceful language, but the pervasive manipulative tactics exceed justified advocacy.
