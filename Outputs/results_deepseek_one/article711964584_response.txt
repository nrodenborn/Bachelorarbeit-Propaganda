### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:  

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "über-left pol" (referring to Chris Bryant), "savages" (describing those threatening violence).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on the Geller/Spencer ban (e.g., "Geller-Spencer ban," "banned us," "ban on all political ads").  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Safe by surrender?" (a rhetorical phrase framing opposition as capitulation).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings of "Islamization of the West," "sharia over freedom," and "path to national suicide."  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "The Dutch media now claim that one of them doesn’t depict Muslim migrants being violent... Even if this is true..." (casting doubt on media accuracy).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: Calling the Geller ban "one of that once great nation’s darkest moments." Minimization: Downplaying the retweeted videos as "just factual."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – References to "British values," "freedom-fighters," and the U.S. saving Britain from extinction in WWII.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Savages," "Islamization," "totalitarians," "national suicide" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Implicitly compares Western elites to "Vichy" collaborators by citing "sharia normed and accepted by Western elites."  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "The worldwide howl at Trump’s retweets" (implying broad consensus against Trump).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames the Geller ad ban for subsequent restrictions (e.g., Catholic Church ads blocked), ignoring complex policy factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – "Voices of sanity" (unspecified who this refers to), "totalitarians" (vague labeling).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Geller’s own book (*FATWA: Hunted in America*) as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents a false binary: "surrender" vs. safety, with no middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Educate those around you" (shuts down discourse by framing the book as definitive truth).  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Shifts focus to the Catholic Church ad ban when discussing Trump’s potential ban.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Misrepresents Bryant’s "fascism" accusation as "defending British values."  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – "While admitting numerous jihad preachers, Britain is keeping out the voices of sanity..." (accuses opponents of hypocrisy).

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of emotional manipulation, distortion, and persuasive techniques to advance a specific ideological agenda. Key indicators include:  
1. **Source & Agenda**: Authored by Pamela Geller (a controversial activist), the text promotes her book and frames her ban as a martyrdom for "freedom," while attacking critics as enemies of Western values.  
2. **Emotional Appeals**: Loaded language ("savages," "totalitarians") and fear-mongering ("Islamization," "national suicide") override rational discourse.  
3. **Distortion of Facts**:  
   - Minimizes the context of Trump’s retweets (originally from a far-right figure with criminal convictions).  
   - Equates criticism of Trump with support for "sharia," ignoring nuanced debates.  
4. **Us-vs-Them Framing**: Portrays Geller/Trump as defenders of "British values" against "über-left" politicians and "Western elites" colluding with "jihadists." This dichotomous narrative suppresses middle-ground perspectives.  
5. **Self-Victimization**: The text centers Geller’s ban as an inflection point for Western decline, leveraging personal experience to generalize about societal collapse.  
6. **Call to Action**: Explicit promotion of Geller’s book ("Get the book. Buy it for friends") aims to monetize and spread the ideology.  

**Why not 100%?**  
The text references factual events (e.g., the 2013 Geller ban, Trump’s retweets), but these are weaponized to fuel polarization. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges that core events are real, though their interpretation is heavily slanted. Overall, the pervasive techniques, lack of balanced analysis, and promotional intent confirm propaganda.
