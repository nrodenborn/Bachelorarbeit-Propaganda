***

Verdict – 35% – The text is not a piece of pure propaganda, as its primary purpose is to report on an event and debunk what it presents as misinformation. It grounds its argument in factual reporting, such as clarifying that the tracer rounds Haig sold were likely not used in the attack and that the sale itself was legal. However, the article is far from neutral and employs several propaganda techniques to persuade the reader. It uses Name calling ("crackpots," "noxious"), Loaded Language ("bonkers," "ludicrous"), and Doubt to aggressively discredit the conspiracy theorists and their claims. This represents a strong authorial bias, moving the text from objective journalism into the realm of opinion or advocacy journalism. While it uses these techniques to counter what it perceives as harmful theories, the deliberate use of persuasive and emotionally charged language gives it clear propagandistic qualities.
