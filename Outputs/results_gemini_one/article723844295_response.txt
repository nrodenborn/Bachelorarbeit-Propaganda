Name calling – No – The text does not attack a subject with an insulting label. It refers to "ISIS terrorists," which is a standard designation for the group, not a pejorative label used to insult an opponent in the argument.

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the core message of doubt and secret evidence. Rep. Perry states, “Recently I have been made aware of what I believe to be credible evidence,” and later reiterates, “I have received what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence.” The phrase “something is not adding up” is also used to reinforce this idea.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases that function as a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text supports the idea of a government cover-up by instilling fear of terrorism. Example: "ISIS terrorists, he said, infiltrated the U.S. via the southern border prior to the attack." This links a mass shooting to foreign terrorists and an insecure border to heighten anxiety.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is framed to question the credibility of the official investigation. Example: "Americans still have no idea what happened in Las Vegas in October... Meanwhile, the local law enforcement investigative services are telling us there is no terrorist connection–lone gunman, again, something is not adding up.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline uses exaggeration to attract readers. Example: "Lawmaker makes shocking claim about the Vegas massacre (video)". The word "shocking" is used to sensationalize the lawmaker's unsubstantiated assertion.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its claims.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses words to appeal to emotion and create a sense of sensationalism and conspiracy. Example: "And one lawmaker is hinting that the government is covering up a big story about terrorism." The phrases "covering up" and "big story" are emotionally charged.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by associating it with a hated group like the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea. It presents a fringe theory, not one that is claimed to be widely accepted.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text assumes a simple cause for a complex event. Example: "If ISIS warns about an attack and then an attack occurs and claims responsibility after the fact, it seems to me that at a minimum, they should have some portion of the investigation to clearly debunk that claim." This simplifies the standard of evidence by suggesting a direct causal link based only on correlation.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The lawmaker is deliberately vague when pressed for details, confusing the audience. Example: "Like I said, nothing adds up, but I’m just telling you, I have received what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence of a possible terrorist nexus, and we’re gonna have to wait… until the situation develops."

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the lawmaker's position as a supposed authority to lend credibility to the claim. Example: "During an appearance with Tucker Carlson on Fox, Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) said he’s seen credible evidence that ISIS was involved..." His status as a Congressman is used as evidence that his information is legitimate.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text presents an alternative to the official narrative but does not frame the situation as a choice between only two possibilities, excluding all others.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – A phrase is used to discourage further critical thought on the matter. Example: "we’re gonna have to wait… until the situation develops." This is used to shut down the request for evidence and end the discussion.

Red herring – No – The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main argument. The discussion remains focused on the cause of the Las Vegas shooting.

Straw men – No – The text does not refute a misrepresentation of an opponent's argument. It directly challenges the official findings.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the audience to distrust the official government narrative of the Las Vegas shooting. It achieves this by heavily relying on several key propaganda techniques working in concert. The piece uses an Appeal to Authority (a Congressman) to introduce a claim that stokes Appeal to Fear (ISIS terrorists crossing the border). It relentlessly sows Doubt ("something is not adding up," "Americans still have no idea") and uses Loaded Language ("shocking claim," "covering up") to create a sense of conspiracy. Crucially, the entire argument is built on Obfuscation, as the lawmaker repeatedly mentions "credible evidence" but refuses to provide any, using Thought-terminating clichés ("we're gonna have to wait") to deflect scrutiny. The combination of these techniques creates a powerful piece of persuasive content designed to manipulate the reader's emotions and beliefs rather than present a factual, evidence-based report.
