Straw men – No – The text makes direct accusations rather than misrepresenting and refuting an opponent's argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text attacks an opponent directly for their actions rather than charging them with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to objectively inform the reader but to persuade them to adopt a specific political viewpoint through emotional manipulation. The text takes a news report (a "kernel of truth") and wraps it in numerous propaganda techniques to advance an agenda. It uses loaded language ("Jihad Terror Attacks") and name-calling ("the worst president") to create an emotional response. It employs a red herring by pivoting from the 9/11 claim to a separate attack on the Iran nuclear deal and President Obama. It casts doubt on credible sources ("mainstream media") while using appeals to authority to bolster its own claims. Finally, it uses logical fallacies like causal oversimplification and the black & white fallacy to frame complex historical events in a simplistic way that supports its narrative. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to propagandize rather than inform.
