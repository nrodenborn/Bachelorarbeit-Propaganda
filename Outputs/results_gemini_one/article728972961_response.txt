Here are the propaganda techniques and whether they are used in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The introduction by MJM refers to the pontificate of Pope Francis as a "diabolical debacle". Archbishop Lefebvre refers to his opponents as "progressives," "modernists," and "more or less Marxist," and describes a Nuncio's speech as "the discourse of a Freemason."

2.  Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses phrases like "destruction of the Church," "crisis in the Church," "mutation," and "change in the Church" to reinforce the central message of decay. The idea of "Freemasonry" or "Masonic" influence is also repeated numerous times as the cause of the crisis.

3.  Slogans – Yes – The introduction by MJM uses several short, memorable phrases to rally the audience: "Stay in the fight! Keep the Faith. Never surrender!"

4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by framing the situation in apocalyptic terms. Examples include: "I refuse to contribute to the destruction of the Church," "the smoke of Satan has entered the Church," and "if this crisis continues, many people will go to hell."

5.  Doubt – Yes – The text consistently questions the credibility and motives of the Church leadership. For example: "How is it possible the pope signed this decree? Signed this constitution? I don’t know. It is a big mystery." and "He is a mysterious man. We cannot give a definition of the man."

6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration, such as: "all of the young bishops are worse [than the bishops in Spain] in that they are more or less Marxist." It also uses minimization when Lefebvre presents his actions as simple fidelity: "I have done nothing. I believe nothing other than what the Church has believed for twenty centuries."

7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific religious identity (traditional Catholicism) as a form of patriotism. Examples include: "heroic band of Catholic brothers that mounted the twentieth century’s last stand for Christ the King" and "if I do that, then I betray my mother, the Church."

8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to sway the reader, such as "diabolical debacle," "Freemasonic infiltration," "scorned and mocked," "heroic band," "sensual dancing," and "sacrilege."

9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses the same technique by associating the new ideas in the Church with groups hated by the target audience: Freemasons, communists, and Marxists. Example: "The Instructions said the infiltration will take perhaps not one year... but perhaps a century. The Carbonari must enter into the seminary... and slowly, very slowly, the priests will have the ideals of the revolution; of the Freemasons."

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text appeals to the growing popularity of its own movement as a sign of its righteousness. Example: "For the coming year we have 59 applications to our seminary in Econe, Switzerland – applications from the United States, from England, from Germany, from France, and Spain. Good young men with good dispositions are coming from everywhere."

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for the complex changes in the 20th-century Catholic Church: a century-long conspiracy by Freemasons that culminated in the Second Vatican Council. Example: "I think that the mutation in the Church came in through the Second Vatican Council... this change in the Church began one century before [the Council]."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – When discussing the Pope's potential culpability, Lefebvre introduces extreme possibilities while claiming ignorance, creating suspicion without making a direct accusation. Example: "Some say the pope was liberal before he was elected pope, and perhaps (we do not know) he gave his name to Freemasonry... It is possible, but we do not know. But if he was excommunicated, then he is not pope... I don’t know. It is a mystery I cannot understand."

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text appeals to the authority of pre-Vatican II popes and documents to validate its position against the current Church leadership. Example: "What did you do with the encyclical of Pope Pius XI, Quas Primas? 'Ah, but now the Pope cannot write an encyclical like Quas Primas.'"

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: the absolute "Tradition" of the past (good) and the "new religion" of the post-Vatican II Church (bad/destructive). Example: "I refused to contribute to the destruction of the Church. I am sure that my seminaries are contributing to the restoration of the Church."

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses simplistic phrases to shut down complex discussion. The introductory slogans ("Keep the Faith. Never surrender!") serve this purpose, as does the concluding statement: "The Church is tradition. It is not revolution."

16. Red herring – No – The text consistently focuses on its central argument about the destruction of the Church by liberal/Masonic forces. While many arguments are fallacious, it does not appear to introduce a completely irrelevant topic to distract from a specific point being debated.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the position of its opponents to make it easier to attack. For example, it reframes the Vatican II concept of religious freedom as a theological claim that all religions are equal: "But practically, we would refuse this Kingdom of Jesus Christ if we said that Luther, Mohammed, Buddha and Jesus Christ are all the same."

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text accuses its opponents of hypocrisy. The editor's note [2] does this by pointing out that "Paul VI received all kinds of people (abortionists, freemasons, etc.)" while demanding submission from Lefebvre. Lefebvre himself implies the Pope is a hypocrite for lamenting the "smoke of Satan" while allegedly being responsible for it.

***

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or present a balanced historical account, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly polarized viewpoint. This is achieved through the dense and varied use of propaganda techniques, with 17 out of the 18 listed techniques being clearly identifiable.

The entire piece, from the editor's introduction to the Archbishop's speech, is structured to create a powerful "us vs. them" narrative. It employs emotional manipulation (Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language, Name Calling), logical fallacies (Black & White Fallacy, Causal Oversimplification, Straw Man), and identity-based appeals (Flag-Waving, Reduction ad Hitlerum) to delegitimize the mainstream Catholic Church and its leadership. The narrative is built on a simple, conspiratorial cause (Freemasonic infiltration) for a complex series of events, a hallmark of propaganda. The text aims to recruit followers ("Isn't it time for you to subscribe?") and reinforce the beliefs of existing ones ("welcome reminder of why we must continue to fight") by framing a schismatic movement as a "heroic" and "last stand" for the true faith. The sheer concentration of these persuasive and manipulative techniques makes its classification as propaganda almost certain.
