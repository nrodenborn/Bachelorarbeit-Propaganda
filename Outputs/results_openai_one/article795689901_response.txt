Verdict – 70% – The text displays several propaganda techniques, such as appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, and black & white fallacy.

However, not all techniques are present, and some information is factual reporting, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood of it being pure propaganda.
