Name calling – Yes – The text attacks Kavanaugh with insulting labels such as “constitution-hating and tyrannical,” an “enemy to privacy,” and an “enemy of the Fourth Amendment.”

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the exact same poll question and options three times in a row: “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?”

Slogans – Yes – The text includes the hashtag slogan “#StoptheNDAA” from a video post it embeds, which is a brief and memorable phrase intended to rally support for a cause.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting Kavanaugh’s confirmation will lead to a “Gestapo like police state” and an irreversible future where Americans lose their freedom and privacy.

Doubt – Yes – The text’s main premise is to cast doubt on the media’s motives for its coverage, stating it “serve[s] as a great distraction.” It also questions Kavanaugh’s supposed support for the constitution: “While Kavanaugh may be an ostensible supporter of the Second Amendment, his record indicates that he all but cannot stand the Fourth.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration when it claims, “the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed over the sex abuse allegations,” which is a hyperbolic misrepresentation of the opposition’s stance.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to American patriotism and identity by framing the entire argument as a defense of the U.S. Constitution, specifically the Fourth Amendment, and the fight to preserve “how much freedom and privacy Americans get to keep.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to influence the reader, such as “tyrannical tendencies,” “mudslinging orgy,” “kangaroo courts,” and “Gestapo like police state.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of Kavanaugh’s judicial philosophy by comparing its potential outcome to the Nazis: “Exactly what this “special need” is that can constitute a Gestapo like police state surveilling its own citizens is a moving target...”

Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea. Instead, it presents its own view as being held by a select few who “see through the facade,” in opposition to the mainstream focus.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The headline itself presents a simple cause for a complex issue: “MSM Using Kavanaugh Sex Scandal to Distract You From Real Reason He Shouldn’t Be Confirmed.” This attributes the media’s focus on the allegations to a single, deliberate motive (distraction), ignoring other complex factors.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague or obscure. Its argument, while biased, is presented directly and forcefully with the clear goal of persuading the reader of a specific point.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites several authorities to support its claims, including Senator Rand Paul, Representative Justin Amash, Judge Andrew Napolitano, and Liza Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by framing the situation as two extremes: “While the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed... and the right is attacking the alleged victims, others... are trying to draw attention to the fact that Kavanaugh is a champion of the police and surveillance state.” This presents its own view as the only sensible alternative.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The article does not use phrases that discourage critical thought. It is an argumentative piece that actively tries to provoke thought on its chosen topic, rather than shut down discussion with clichés.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll, “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?”, which is completely irrelevant to the article's topic of Brett Kavanaugh and serves only to distract the reader and collect user data.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that was not being made by claiming “the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed over the sex abuse allegations.” This creates an extreme, false position for the opposition (a straw man) that is easy to dismiss, making the author's own position seem more reasonable in comparison.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge an opponent with hypocrisy to deflect criticism. Its attacks on the media and Kavanaugh are direct rather than relying on a “what about you?”-style argument.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and comprehensive example of propaganda. It employs a vast majority (13 out of 18) of the listed techniques not as incidental rhetorical flourishes, but as the fundamental structure of its argument. The article’s purpose is not to inform but to persuade and manipulate the reader's opinion through a highly emotional and biased presentation. It uses name-calling, loaded language, and appeals to fear (e.g., “constitution-hating,” “Gestapo like police state”) to create a strong negative emotional response towards the subject. It builds a fallacious argument by misrepresenting opposing views through straw man tactics and exaggeration, while simplifying complex events into a single, conspiratorial cause. It distracts the reader with a literal red herring (the U.N. poll) and attempts to legitimize its biased viewpoint by heavily relying on appeals to authority. The sheer number and deliberate integration of these techniques confirm the text’s nature as a piece of propaganda designed to push a specific agenda.
