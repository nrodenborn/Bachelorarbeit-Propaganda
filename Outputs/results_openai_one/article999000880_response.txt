**Verdict – 80% –**  
The text exhibits several classic propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, appeal to authority, and the black & white fallacy. The narrative is constructed to provoke anxiety about the migrant caravan, emphasize military and patriotic responses, and frame the issue in stark, emotionally charged terms. While it does not use every technique on the list, the presence of multiple strong propaganda indicators—especially those that play on fear, patriotism, and oversimplified dichotomies—makes it highly likely (80%) that this text is propaganda. The language and framing are designed to influence public opinion rather than to inform neutrally.
