Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text "A colossal Neptunian storm just vanished before our eyes":

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to the subject (the storm, Neptune, or scientists).
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated throughout the text for emphasis or persuasion.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL!" is absent).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text describes a scientific observation; it does not attempt to instill fear about the storm, Neptune, or any alternative ideas.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The credibility of individuals, institutions, or the observation itself is not questioned. It presents the findings as factual observation.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Descriptions like "colossal," "massive," "large enough to swallow an entire continent," and "special sight" are contextualized as factual observations of Neptune's known scale and the significance of the event to scientists, not obvious hyperbole or understatement for persuasive effect.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty (e.g., "We the People" is absent).
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – While words like "colossal," "roars," "dying gasps," and "spectacular" are evocative, they are used descriptively within a scientific context to convey the nature and scale of the observed phenomena, not primarily to trigger strong emotional responses or stereotypes for persuasion.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No idea or group is linked to Nazis, the Vichy regime, or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or suggestion to join a majority view.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text explicitly states the complexity ("scientists are still at a loss," "no evidence," "most likely," "forcing scientists to go back to the drawing board") and does not attribute the storm's behavior to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and descriptive. Terms like "instability in the sheared eastward and westward winds" are scientific terminology, not deliberate obfuscation.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text cites scientists (Agustín Sánchez-Lavega, Michael H. Wong) and institutions (University of the Basque Country, University of California at Berkeley, NASA) to support the claims about the storm's behavior and significance. *Example:* "Agustín Sánchez-Lavega of the University of the Basque Country in Spain explains.", "Michael H. Wong of the University of California at Berkeley says.", "The planet, which NASA says is the windiest...".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text does not present only two simplistic choices or outcomes. It discusses scientific observation, uncertainty, and the need for revised models.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking or discussion (e.g., "it is what it is," "just the way it is").
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the topic of the Neptune storm, its observation, and its implications for scientific understanding. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text accurately represents the previous scientific expectations ("well-known studies," "dynamical simulations," "we thought") and then contrasts them with the new observation. It does not misrepresent or refute a weaker argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – There are no accusations of hypocrisy directed at any person or group mentioned.

**Verdict – 0% –** The text is a straightforward scientific news report describing an astronomical observation made by the Hubble Space Telescope. Its primary purpose is to inform about a specific event (the dissipation of a storm on Neptune) and its significance to planetary science (contradicting previous models). It uses factual descriptions, cites relevant scientific authorities appropriately (Appeal to Authority), and discusses the implications of the finding without exhibiting any persuasive intent, emotional manipulation, distortion, or agenda characteristic of propaganda. The tone is informative and objective, focusing on the science and the process of discovery/revision. There is no discernible attempt to promote a particular ideology, belief system, or course of action beyond reporting scientific findings.
