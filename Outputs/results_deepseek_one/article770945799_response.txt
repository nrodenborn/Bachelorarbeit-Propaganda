### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "corruption and criminal activity of Hillary Clinton" (insults Clinton with negative labels).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on "unequal protection," "unfair," and "double standard" (e.g., cited 3+ times).  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL"); arguments are descriptive, not slogan-like.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **No** – Focuses on past injustice, not future threats or fear-mongering.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions credibility of Obama/DOJ: "willingness to not prosecute Hillary Clinton," implying bias.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Minimizes Saucier’s crime ("minor military infraction") while exaggerating Clinton’s ("more serious violations," "corruption").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to American identity: "violation of the rights of all Americans," "inalienable rights" under Constitution.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotional/biased terms: "scapegoated," "overzealous," "double standard," "get off scot-free."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis/hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames Clinton email scandal for Saucier’s prosecution: "prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are direct; no unclear phrasing.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites U.S. Constitution as moral/legal authority.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents only two options: prosecute Saucier unfairly OR hold Clinton accountable (ignores nuances of each case).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Introduces Saucier’s lawyer being barred as a distraction: accuses NY officials of "trying to hinder his court fight," irrelevant to the core lawsuit.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Charges hypocrisy: Focuses on Clinton not being prosecuted to deflect from Saucier’s crime (e.g., "Clinton got off scot-free").

### Verdict – 75% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** (75%) due to systematic use of manipulative techniques. It employs **name-calling** (labeling Clinton corrupt), **whataboutism** (deflecting Saucier’s guilt by comparing it to Clinton), **loaded language** ("scapegoated," "double standard"), and **minimization/exaggeration** (downplaying Saucier’s crime while inflating Clinton’s). It frames Saucier as a victim of political bias, using **flag-waving** (Constitution, "rights of all Americans") and **doubt** (questioning DOJ integrity) to fuel outrage. The **black-and-white fallacy** oversimplifies justice as "Saucier vs. Clinton," ignoring legal nuances. While based on real events (lawsuit, pardon), the narrative selectively emphasizes perceived injustice through emotionally charged language, omitting counter-evidence (e.g., differences in intent, scale, or DOJ protocols between cases). The **red herring** about Saucier’s lawyer further distracts. These techniques collectively aim to persuade readers of systemic corruption rather than inform neutrally, aligning with propaganda objectives. The 25% uncertainty reflects factual elements (e.g., lawsuit details, quotes), but the framing is overwhelmingly agenda-driven.
