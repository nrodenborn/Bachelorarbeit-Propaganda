---

**Verdict – 25% –** The text exhibits *some* propaganda techniques (e.g., loaded language, repetition, red herring via the Acosta poll), primarily in statements attributed to Kemp and Abrams, and through the framing of the website (Breitbart). However, the core content reports factual events (lawsuit announcement, vote counts, certification deadlines) and quotes from both campaigns without overt fabrication. The embedded poll and selective emphasis on Kemp's "temper tantrum" quote show bias, but the article stops short of systematic deception. Most techniques derive from quoted political rhetoric rather than the author's narrative. Thus, while slanted, it retains significant informational value.
