1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the official investigation as the "infamously botched Vegas investigation," which is an insulting label.
2. Repetition – Yes – The rhetorical question "Are they for real?" is repeated to express incredulity, and the central message about the changing, contradictory timeline is reiterated throughout the article.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – No – While the subject matter is frightening, the text does not argue its point by instilling fear of an alternative idea. It focuses on creating distrust of the authorities.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to question the credibility of the official investigation. For example, it asks, "How can they possibly hold those two contradictory ideas at the same time?" and highlights the multiple "versions" of the timeline.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The Editor's Note claims reporters would have "forced him to stumble all over himself in answering them," which is an exaggeration of what would likely happen in a press conference.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text specifically identifies the victims as "58 Americans," appealing to a sense of national identity and loss to underscore the severity of the investigative failures.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "infamously botched" and "stumble all over himself" to create a negative impression of the authorities.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other groups hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that questioning the official story is a widespread and common-sense reaction by asking, "Do the FBI and law enforcement think people won’t talk about it or speculate as to what happened?"
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The Editor's Note suggests the simple reason reporters were barred was because "They would have posed real genuine questions," simplifying the complex reasons for managing press access during a major incident.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is not vague; its purpose is to accuse the authorities of obfuscation and vagueness, but its own argument is presented clearly.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses "William Jacobson," "Legal Insurrection," the "WaPo" (Washington Post), and MGM's official statements as authorities to bolster its argument against the police timeline.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the changing timelines as a result of either a deliberate conspiracy or gross incompetence, largely ignoring other possibilities such as the normal confusion and correction process in a chaotic, large-scale investigation.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The repeated use of the rhetorical question "Are they for real?" functions to dismiss the official position out of hand and discourage a more nuanced consideration of the authorities' statements.
16. Red herring – Yes – The Editor's Note about Laura Loomer and Mike Tokes being barred from the presser is a red herring, as it introduces a separate issue about specific journalists to distract from the main evidence and immediately frame the authorities as hiding something.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that was not explicitly made by asking, "Do the FBI and law enforcement think people won’t talk about it or speculate as to what happened?" This frames the authorities as being against any public discussion, an easily defeated position, rather than simply asking for patience during an active investigation.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism of one party by accusing another of hypocrisy on an unrelated matter. It remains focused on the Las Vegas investigation.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly propagandistic. While it is based on factual events (the timeline of the investigation did change), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader that the authorities are incompetent and/or engaged in a cover-up. It achieves this by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques. The central technique is casting Doubt, which is reinforced by Loaded Language ("botched"), Name Calling, and Exaggeration. It creates an in-group/out-group dynamic by using Flag-Waving ("Americans") and presenting a Black & White Fallacy where the reader must choose between the "official story" and the "real questions." The use of rhetorical questions and Thought-Terminating Clichés ("Are they for real?") serves to shut down critical thinking and encourage emotional agreement. The entire piece is framed to lead the reader to a single, pre-determined conclusion, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
