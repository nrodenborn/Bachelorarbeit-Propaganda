Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "effeminate pansy" (used to insult Keith Ellison).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, memorable phrase is used as a slogan throughout the text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Implied fear that Ellison is avoiding accountability ("simply does not want to answer to the American people") and that the media is complicit ("media has kept it quiet").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Repeatedly questions Ellison's credibility and innocence: "Well, that's not entirely accurate" (regarding his statement), "I'm not sure that this is nothing more than damage control", casting doubt on the investigation's independence ("met with derision... said she is not independent").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – *Exaggeration:* Describing the alleged abuse as "pure hell". *Minimization:* Downplaying evidence against Kavanaugh ("unlike the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh... We do have a police report") while emphasizing the lack of evidence against Ellison in Kavanaugh's case ("unlike Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh... has not stood before a committee... allegations... remain unsubstantiated").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Numerous emotionally charged words/phrases: "Accused Woman Abuser", "lingered in the public sphere", "pure hell", "derision", "extremely troubling", "deeply impacted", "damage control", "effeminate pansy", "simply does not want to answer", "hide from a female reporter", "fought back".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No attempt to link Ellison or his actions to a universally hated group.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – References public reaction ("met with derision from many who said she is not independent, including Donald Trump Jr.") and implies a lack of media coverage means the story lacks credibility ("not held up under media scrutiny, so no stories ran").
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Simplifies the lack of media coverage to mean the allegations lacked credibility: "not held up under media scrutiny, so no stories ran", ignoring other potential reasons for lack of coverage.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is generally direct and accusatory, not vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – While sources (Star Tribune, Dave Weigel) are cited, they are used to report facts or opinions, not primarily as unquestionable authorities whose endorsement proves the argument. Donald Trump Jr.'s derision is presented as an example, not an authoritative proof.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Creates a stark, unfair contrast between Ellison and Kavanaugh: Ellison is portrayed as avoiding scrutiny ("has not stood before a committee"), using a potentially biased investigation ("not independent"), and being weak ("effeminate pansy... hide"), while Kavanaugh is portrayed as facing scrutiny head-on and being strong ("faced it all and fought back"). This ignores the significant differences in context (Senate confirmation vs House ethics probe, state AG race vs SCOTUS nomination) and complexities of each case.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "accusations does not make one guilty" – This phrase, while true in a legal sense, is used here to dismissively equate the situations of Ellison and Kavanaugh and potentially shut down deeper discussion of the specific evidence or context surrounding Ellison's case.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The repeated poll about replacing Nikki Haley as UN Ambassador is completely irrelevant to the main topic of Keith Ellison's abuse allegations and investigation.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Misrepresents Ellison's position on the investigation: He called for a House Ethics investigation. The text refutes a demand for an FBI investigation ("Ellison has called on the House of Representatives, **not the FBI**, as Senate Democrats have urged in the case of Judge Kavanaugh"), which Ellison did not actually call for. It also misrepresents the media's initial reason for not reporting ("not held up under media scrutiny") implying a judgment on credibility, whereas the cited tweet (Dave Weigel) suggests it was because the story hadn't gained traction *before* the son's post.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – The *entire premise* of the article is a comparison to Brett Kavanaugh ("unlike Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh...", "accusations does not make one guilty for Ellison anymore than they do for Judge Kavanaugh", contrasting their responses). This deflects from seriously addressing the allegations against Ellison on their own merits by constantly shifting focus to Kavanaugh.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs numerous techniques to attack Keith Ellison, primarily through loaded language, name-calling, creating a false equivalence/dichotomy with Brett Kavanaugh (Whataboutism, Black & White Fallacy), casting doubt on Ellison's statements and actions, minimizing aspects of the Kavanaugh situation while exaggerating aspects of Ellison's, using a red herring, and employing thought-terminating clichés. The core purpose is not balanced reporting but to discredit Ellison, undermine the investigation into him, portray him negatively compared to Kavanaugh, and dismiss the allegations against him as politically motivated ("damage control") while downplaying the evidence presented by the accuser (the police report). The tone is consistently accusatory and biased, leaving little room for objective presentation of facts.
