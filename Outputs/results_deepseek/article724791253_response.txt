Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "declaring him a 'bigot'", "ridiculous exercise in virtue-signaling", "Britain’s hypocrisy and double standards".
2.  **Repetition** – No – While anti-Trump sentiment is consistent, no specific phrase or idea is repeated verbatim multiple times for emphasis.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrase designed for rallying is used.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Descriptions of "jihad preachers" and their violent quotes (e.g., Shaykh Hamza Sodagar on killing homosexuals) are used to instill fear about who is being allowed into Britain.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "only highlights Britain’s hypocrisy and double standards" directly questions the credibility and fairness of UK immigration decisions.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "relentlessly appeasement-minded government" exaggerates the government's stance. Minimizing the significance or context of the Tower Hamlets vote by calling it a "ridiculous exercise" and a "farce".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes (Implied) – The contrast between banning Trump critics (like the author and Geller) for "telling the truth" while admitting "jihad preachers" appeals to a sense of betrayed national values/security, implicitly invoking patriotism.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "virtue-signaling", "hypocrisy", "double standards", "appeasement-minded", "jihad preachers", "hatred", "jihad violence", "hardline", "corruptly elected", "farce", "bigoted", "Islamophobic propaganda", "division and hatred".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – "‘let us support Hitler the Great.’ These people, corruptly elected, have no shame." Links the council members proposing the ban to Hitler to discredit them.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "the neighbouring Royal Borough of Greenwich formally adopted a similar motion" implies this is a growing trend others are joining.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames the admission of controversial figures solely on government "appeasement" without exploring complex immigration, legal, or diplomatic factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The arguments, while biased, are presented directly rather than obscurely.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No specific authority figure or institution is cited to validate the main arguments. (Mentioning the Archbishop welcoming someone is descriptive, not used as evidence *for* the author's points).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents the situation as Britain either banning truth-tellers (like the author) or admitting dangerous extremists, ignoring nuance, legitimate security concerns, or other categories of people admitted/banned.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "virtue-signaling", "appeasement-minded" are used to dismiss the council's motivations without further analysis.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The mention of the Hitler tweet ("‘let us support Hitler the Great’") and the corruption scandal involving a previous mayor are irrelevant to the specific arguments about Trump's ban or UK immigration policy but are used to discredit the council.
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Refutes the idea that the council/mayor truly care about diversity and tolerance ("complained that President Trump 'doesn’t applaud diversity...'") implying hypocrisy, rather than addressing their stated reasons for the ban directly.
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – The core argument is "Why ban Trump/truth-tellers when you admit these bad people?" ("Pamela Geller and I are banned... Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers... Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops...").

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a significant number of propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Reduction ad Hitlerum, Bandwagon, Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating clichés, Red Herring, Straw Men, Whataboutism) to present a highly biased and emotionally charged narrative. The core strategy is Whataboutism, deflecting criticism of Trump's ban by attacking UK immigration decisions regarding other individuals, framed through inflammatory language (e.g., "jihad preachers", "appeasement") and fallacious reasoning (e.g., False Dilemma, Guilt by Association via Hitler reference). It selectively presents facts (e.g., focusing on controversial figures admitted while ignoring context or others banned) and uses emotionally loaded terms throughout to persuade the reader of UK hypocrisy and the supposed threat of Islamist influence, rather than providing a balanced or objective analysis of the Tower Hamlets vote or UK immigration policy. The permission line from Robert Spencer, a known controversial figure on Islam, further signals its ideological alignment. While it reports an actual event (the vote), the framing, language, and argumentation are classic propaganda.
