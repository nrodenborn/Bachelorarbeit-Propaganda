Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack the perceived ideology of public schools, such as "Far-Left Bias," "Left-wing social engineering," and "The craziness over transgender students."

Repetition – Yes – The core message that public schools are dangerous and ideologically driven, while homeschooling is a superior alternative, is repeated throughout the text, first by focusing on physical violence and then on ideological issues.

Slogans – Yes – The sub-headline "The Left is driving more kids OUT of public schools" acts as a brief, memorable phrase to encapsulate a key argument.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text explicitly supports homeschooling by instilling fear of public schools, citing "school violence," "deadly school massacres," "the bullying, the unsafe environments."

Doubt – Yes – The entire piece is constructed to make the reader question the credibility and safety of the public school system by highlighting a curated list of its alleged failings.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline uses words like "MAJOR" and "Spikes" to exaggerate the scale and importance of the trend. The quote that phone calls "exploded" is also an example of exaggeration.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and identity by citing controversies like students "tak[ing] a knee' during the playing of the National Anthem" and schools "refusing to allow students to wear shirts that... feature the American flag." It also appeals to religious identity with the line, "There is no better way to keep the Catholic family together."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical phrases like "Far-Left Bias," "Left-wing social engineering," and "deadly school massacres" to influence the reader's emotions.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by suggesting it is popular with a group like the Nazis or a similarly hated entity.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text creates the impression that a massive number of parents are switching to homeschooling, using phrases like "Homeschooling Spikes," "the phones started ringing... and they haven’t stopped yet," and "our numbers have doubled" to suggest a popular trend.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex reasons for the rise in homeschooling by attributing it almost exclusively to two factors: "School Violence" and "Far-Left Bias."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is quite direct and clear in its accusations and its overall message, rather than being deliberately obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the "National Home Education Research Institute," *The Washington Times*, and the presidents of homeschooling coalitions as authorities to lend credibility to its claims.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between two extremes: the dangerous and ideologically corrupt public school system versus the safe and morally sound homeschooling environment, ignoring other options like private schools or improving public schools.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The statement, "There is no better way to keep the Catholic family together and committed to the Catholic restoration than the Catholic home school," is presented as an absolute truth that discourages critical thought or discussion of alternatives.

Red herring – Yes – The lengthy personal anecdote in the "REMNANT COMMENT" section about the author's own children's success is an irrelevant distraction from the main argument about school violence and bias, used to create an emotional appeal.

Straw men – Yes – The text creates a caricature of public schools as being primarily focused on "Left-wing social engineering" and "craziness," an exaggerated argument that is easier to attack than the complex reality of public education.

Whataboutism – No – The text attacks its opponents but does not use the specific technique of deflecting a criticism by accusing the opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform objectively but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint and take action (choosing to homeschool). It achieves this by employing a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques.

The piece begins by masquerading as a news report, citing a study and a news article to create a veneer of objectivity (Appeal to authority). However, it quickly pivots to a highly biased argument. It heavily relies on emotional manipulation through Appeal to fear, using loaded language like "deadly school massacres" to create anxiety about public schools. It then creates a clear "us vs. them" narrative by using Name calling ("Far-Left Bias") and Flag-Waving (appealing to patriotic and Catholic identity).

The argument is built on logical fallacies, including Causal Oversimplification (blaming only violence and "bias" for a complex trend), the Black & White Fallacy (presenting only the options of "bad" public schools vs. "good" homeschooling), and Straw Men (attacking a caricature of public education). The use of Bandwagon ("numbers have doubled") encourages readers to join what is framed as a growing, popular movement. The inclusion of the personal anecdote is a Red herring designed to distract with an emotional story rather than strengthen the central claim with facts. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions rather than engage in a reasoned, factual discussion.
