Verdict – 75% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, such as name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, and loaded language, which are indicative of an attempt to influence the audience's perception of DREAMERs and illegal immigrants negatively. The use of causal oversimplification and black & white fallacy further suggests an intent to present a biased view. While not all techniques are present, the combination of those that are used points to a high likelihood of the text being propaganda.
