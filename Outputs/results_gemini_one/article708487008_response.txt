Name calling – No – The text uses the term "Black Death," which is a historical name for the plague. While it is a frightening term, it is not used as an insulting label against a person, group, or object in the way the definition describes.

Repetition – Yes – The idea that the plague cannot be fully eliminated is repeated. For example: "The Plague Is Impossible To Eradicate", "the plague will never truly be gone", and the expert quote, “It’s not possible to eradicate plague".

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as a rallying cry or for easy recall of a political idea.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses fear to create an impact. Examples include the headline "Black Death Warning," the statement that the airborne plague "can kill a person in just three hours," and the warning for nine countries "to prepare for a black death attack".

Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or organization. In fact, it relies on the credibility of its sources.

Exaggeration/minimization – No – While the claims are alarming, they are attributed to an expert and supported with reasoning (the plague being widespread in wildlife). The statistics are sourced from the WHO. The text is reporting on these claims, not creating them.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make any appeals to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged language to create a strong impression. Examples include "Black Death Warning" and "black death attack," which are more dramatic and frightening than simply "plague outbreak."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is correct or should be adopted because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text avoids oversimplification by quoting an expert who explains the complex reasons why the plague is difficult to eradicate, such as it being "widespread in wildlife rodents" and the need for a "better understanding of transmission pathways".

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is specific, providing statistics, dates, names of experts, and organizations. It is not deliberately unclear.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The article heavily relies on the credibility of authorities to support its claims. Examples include citing "Dr. Allen Cheng, Professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at Monash University" and the "World Health Organisation (WHO)".

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present only two choices. It discusses reactive versus preventative measures but presents the latter as a "better" approach, not the only other option.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases or clichés to discourage critical thought.

Red herring – No – All the information presented is relevant to the plague outbreak in Madagascar.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that was not being made.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an opponent by accusing them of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 35% – The text is unlikely to be pure propaganda, but it heavily uses propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose appears to be informational, reporting on a real-world health crisis using data from the WHO and quotes from an infectious disease expert. However, it frames this information in a highly sensationalist manner, which is characteristic of "clickbait" journalism. Techniques like Appeal to Fear and Loaded Language ("Black Death Warning," "black death attack") are used to provoke an emotional reaction and attract readers, rather than to push a specific political ideology or manipulate the audience towards a predetermined conclusion without evidence. Therefore, while it employs propaganda tools, it is more accurately described as sensationalist news reporting rather than a piece of propaganda.
