Here's the analysis of the text against the propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against the subject or others.
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated excessively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed for rallying are present.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While discussing a murder suspect, the text states facts without using fear to promote a specific action or viewpoint against alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The credibility of any person, group, or institution is not questioned.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The events and statistics are reported factually without apparent overstatement or understatement.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, national identity, or "us vs. them" sentiment.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – Language is neutral and factual (e.g., "removed," "arrested," "wanted," "criminal offense"). No emotionally charged words or obvious stereotypes are used.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to universally despised groups (like Nazis) is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or action to encourage acceptance. Statistics are presented as facts, not as a reason to join a cause.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text reports events (arrest, removal) without attributing complex societal issues to simple causes.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The language is clear and specific (dates, locations, charges, statistics). No deliberate confusion is present.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While ICE's actions and statistics are reported, no specific authority figure is cited to endorse a broader claim or idea beyond the factual reporting of the agency's actions.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents a specific case and related statistics without reducing a complex issue to only two stark choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No simplistic phrases are used to shut down critical thinking about the situation.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the case of Gonzalez-Aragon and the general statistics of ICE removals. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented or weaker arguments are set up to be refuted.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No attempt is made to charge critics or opponents with hypocrisy to deflect from the subject.

**Verdict – 10% – Explanation:** The text is overwhelmingly a straightforward news report detailing a specific law enforcement action (the removal of a fugitive) and providing relevant contextual statistics about ICE's activities. The language is factual, neutral, and avoids emotional appeals, loaded terms, attacks, or overt persuasion techniques. The inclusion of statistics highlighting the number of criminal fugitives removed, especially the 92% conviction rate for interior removals, *could* be interpreted by some as subtly promoting ICE's effectiveness or mission (a very mild form of institutional promotion, hence the 10%). However, these statistics are presented as objective context without explicit judgment or calls to action. There is no discernible attempt to manipulate emotions, distort reality, or promote a specific ideology beyond reporting the agency's work. It primarily serves an informational purpose rather than a propagandistic one.
