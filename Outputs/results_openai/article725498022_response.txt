Certainly! Let's analyze the text for each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – The text refers to the pope as a “leftist” and uses terms like "snippy tone" and "amazing accusation," which can be seen as derogatory.
   
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes Pope Francis's alleged inaction and the accusations against him, such as the repeated mention of "calumny."

3. **Slogans** – No – The text does not use a brief and memorable phrase that serves as a slogan.

5. **Doubt** – Yes – The text questions the credibility of Pope Francis by highlighting contradictions and criticisms from various sources.

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The text uses phrases like "spectacle" and "unending stream of outrages," which could be seen as exaggerations.

7. **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or identity in the text.

8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like "snippy," "outrages," and "amazing accusation" are emotionally charged and aimed at provoking a reaction.

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by associating it with groups hated by the audience.

10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – The text suggests that many people, including journalists and victims, are against the pope, implying that the reader should join this majority view.

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text implies that the pope's actions alone are responsible for the church's issues, oversimplifying a complex situation.

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is detailed and specific in its criticisms.

13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites various journalists and publications as authorities to support its claims.

14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text presents the situation as either the pope is guilty of inaction, or he is complicit, without exploring other possibilities.

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – The text does not use clichés to discourage critical thought.

16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the central issue of the pope's alleged inaction in abuse cases.

17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not refute an argument that was not presented.

18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge an opponent with hypocrisy.

**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict – 75% –** The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, bandwagon, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These elements suggest a strong likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it appears to be designed to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of Pope Francis by emphasizing his alleged failures and the criticisms against him. The use of emotionally charged language and the presentation of a one-sided narrative further support this assessment.
