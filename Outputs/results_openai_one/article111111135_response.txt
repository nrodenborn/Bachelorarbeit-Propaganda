**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict – 30% –**  
While the text contains some elements that could be considered propaganda techniques—such as the use of loaded language, appeal to authority, doubt, and a reference to Hitler—it primarily functions as a news report summarizing events, statements, and reactions concerning Louis Farrakhan. The use of these techniques is mostly in the context of quoting others or reporting on public perceptions, rather than advancing a specific agenda or manipulating the reader. The text strives for balance by including multiple perspectives and direct quotes from various sources. Therefore, the likelihood of this text being propaganda is moderate but not high; it is more consistent with standard journalistic reporting that includes some emotionally charged language and authoritative references due to the controversial subject matter.
