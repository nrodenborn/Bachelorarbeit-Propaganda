2. **Repetition** – No – No single phrase or message is repeated verbatim throughout.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "peace through strength" (contrasted with "fecklessness through appeasement").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "severely compromised America’s national security," "emboldened the mullahs," and descriptions of Iranian naval aggression imply danger under Obama.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "seemed to be in a perpetual state of confusion," questioning Obama’s judgment on allies/enemies.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "sold everything including the kitchen sink"; Minimization: Obama "didn’t think that the seizure of Americans was important enough to note."

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct and specific (e.g., citing $1.7 billion payments, Project Cassandra).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Uses Trump’s statements as evidence of policy effectiveness (e.g., "Trump noted that 'Iran [was] playing with fire'").  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents Trump’s policy as strong/effective and Obama’s as weak/dangerous with no middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "peace through strength" and "fecklessness through appeasement" shut down nuanced discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All examples tie back to the core Iran policy critique.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic due to:  
1. **Systematic Use of Techniques**: Employs at least 10 distinct propaganda methods (e.g., Name Calling, Loaded Language, Black & White Fallacy) to vilify Obama/Iran and glorify Trump.  
2. **Dehumanizing Language**: Labels opponents with inflammatory terms ("fascist theocracy," "despotic mullahs") to evoke disgust.  
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses fear (national security threats), patriotism ("America stands with the people of Iran"), and outrage (e.g., seized Navy boats) to bypass rational analysis.  
4. **One-Sided Narrative**: Omits context (e.g., JCPOA’s diplomatic goals) and cherry-picks events (2009 protests, 2016 boat seizure) to paint Obama as weak and Trump as decisive.  
5. **False Dichotomies**: Reduces complex foreign policy to a binary of "strength vs. appeasement," dismissing nuance.  
6. **Sourcing Bias**: Relies exclusively on Trump’s perspective and unverified claims (e.g., "stole two satellite phone sim cards... containing classified information").  
7. **Purpose**: Clearly aims to persuade readers that Trump’s approach is superior through distortion, not balanced reporting.  

The 5% reservation acknowledges minor factual elements (e.g., existence of JCPOA, naval incidents), but these are framed to serve the propagandistic goal. The text meets the core criteria of propaganda: systematic persuasion through emotional manipulation and selective truth.
