### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic, employing **12 of 18 techniques** analyzed. Its core purpose is to discredit the *Guardian* and defend Assange by:  
1. **Systematic Vilification**: Labels the *Guardian*’s reporting as "fabrication," "fake news," and "elite-serving," while attributing malicious intent ("designed to shore up consensus" for the neoliberal order).  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses fear (Assange’s imprisonment), loaded language ("rapacious," "venom"), and appeals to authority (Greenwald, Murray) to sway readers.  
3. **Distraction & Deflection**: Redirects focus via whataboutism (Corbyn, Venezuela) and red herrings (Tony Blair, Elliot Higgins) to avoid engaging with the *Guardian*’s evidence.  
4. **Narrative Reinforcement**: Repeatedly asserts the *Guardian*’s bias without substantive counter-evidence, relying on causal oversimplification (blaming Clinton’s loss on narrative shifts) and black/white framing (the *Guardian* as inherently corrupt).  
5. **Suppression of Dissent**: Uses thought-terminating clichés ("fake news") to dismiss opposing viewpoints outright.  

While fact-based critiques exist (e.g., questioning the *Guardian*’s sourcing), the text’s relentless use of propagandistic techniques—especially name-calling, repetition, and deflection—reveals its primary goal: not balanced analysis, but ideological persuasion. The 5% uncertainty arises solely from isolated valid points (e.g., CCTV absence), which are overshadowed by the text’s aggressive rhetorical strategy.
