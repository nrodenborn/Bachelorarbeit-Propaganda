Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Democrats, they do pick their ‘victims’ well, don’t they?" (The sarcastic use of "victims" in quotes implies Democrats cynically select or fabricate claims for political gain, attacking them with an insulting label).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" (This exact question is repeated three times verbatim).
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrase used repeatedly as a slogan for a specific cause or action within the article text itself.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – The text expresses outrage and accusation but doesn't specifically instill fear about consequences of alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The entire article casts doubt on the Democratic Party's sincerity and consistency in believing women's allegations, particularly contrasting their handling of Monahan vs. Ford: "Yet Democrats don’t think his accuser meets the same threshhold as Kavanaugh’s accuser? Apparently."; "Many other Democrats and progressives – who stayed silent when the accusations against Ellison emerged – came out in support of Ford".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Minimization: The text downplays the DNC's announced review of the Ellison allegations ("The allegations didn’t lead to any immediate action... except for the announcement that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) would review the accusations.") while implying Democrats completely ignored or disbelieved Monahan. Exaggeration: The implication that Democrats universally rejected Monahan's claims and fully embraced Ford's without reservation is an oversimplification and exaggeration of their responses.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – The text doesn't appeal to patriotism or national/group identity as a primary argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "turning a blind eye and ear"; "pick their ‘victims’ well"; "smeared, threatened, isolated"; "hypocritical". These phrases use emotionally charged language (negative connotations of neglect, cynicism, victimization, and hypocrisy) to influence the reader's perception.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis or Hitler-era groups/ideas.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – The poll invitation ("take our poll") and the statement "Completing this poll grants you access..." implies participation validates the reader and connects them to a group ("Freedom Outpost" audience).
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The text doesn't oversimplify a complex event's cause to a single factor.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The accusations and responses, while presented selectively, are stated relatively clearly. The core claims (Monahan's accusation, Democratic response, contrast with Kavanaugh/Ford) are explicit.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – "Article posted with permission from Pamela Geller" (Invoking Geller, a known controversial figure, lends the article perceived credibility with a specific audience familiar with her).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – The text strongly implies that Democrats *only* believe women when it suits them politically, presenting a dichotomy: either believe *all* women equally and act identically in every case, or be hypocrites who "pick their victims". It ignores nuance or different contexts between the cases.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" or "that's just common sense" used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The core focus is the comparison between the Democratic response to Monahan vs. Ford/Kavanaugh. While arguably a flawed comparison, it's central to the article's argument, not an irrelevant distraction *from* that argument.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – The article characterizes the Democratic position as not believing Monahan at all and actively isolating/smearing her ("Democrats don’t believe her"; "I’ve been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party"). While some Democrats were criticized for being slower or less vocal, the DNC announced a review, and the text doesn't prove an official party stance of disbelief or active smearing/isolation. It refutes this exaggerated position.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – The core argument is charging Democrats with hypocrisy by contrasting their response to accusations against Ellison (a Democrat) with their response to accusations against Kavanaugh (a Republican nominee): "Karen Monahan... says Democrats... are turning a blind eye and ear toward her claims — yet curiously, finding time and cause to go after Brett Kavanaugh."; "Yet Democrats don’t think his accuser meets the same threshhold as Kavanaugh’s accuser?"; "Monahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations when compared to its treatment of Christine Blasey Ford."

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is not balanced reporting but to persuade the reader of Democratic hypocrisy and cynicism regarding sexual misconduct allegations. This is achieved through:
*   **Name-Calling/Loaded Language:** Labeling Democrats as manipulators of "victims".
*   **Repetition:** The poll question.
*   **Doubt & Whataboutism:** Continuously questioning Democratic sincerity by comparing the Ellison and Kavanaugh cases.
*   **Exaggeration/Minimization:** Downplaying the DNC review while exaggerating Democratic rejection of Monahan; oversimplifying Democratic support for Ford.
*   **Straw Man:** Misrepresenting the Democratic position as universal disbelief and active persecution of Monahan.
*   **Black & White Fallacy:** Presenting the issue as absolute hypocrisy with no room for nuance or case differences.
*   **Bandwagon & Appeal to Authority:** Using the poll and Pamela Geller's permission to build credibility with a specific audience.
The text selectively presents facts (focusing on Democratic responses while largely ignoring Republican responses to both cases) and uses emotionally charged language to drive its narrative. While based on real events and quotes, the framing, emphasis, and use of multiple persuasive techniques clearly mark it as propaganda aimed at discrediting the Democratic Party. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the factual basis of Monahan's accusations and the differing Democratic responses to the two cases, even if the presentation is heavily slanted.
