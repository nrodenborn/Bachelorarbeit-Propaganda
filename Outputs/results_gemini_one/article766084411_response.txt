1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting or dismissive labels for a political group, for example: "the latest illegal immigration debate between Leftists and the Administration".
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – No – The text is a long-form article and does not use brief, memorable phrases in the style of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text attempts to create fear of a secret government plan by linking immigration policy to military exercises and land grabs, stating it "speaks volumes in the government's plan to be able to handle millions of people."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively questions the credibility of official information and the relationships of immigrant families. For example: "Since no one can know if the children really belong to the illegals who say they are their parents, they are separated until that can be verified".
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text makes an unsubstantiated exaggeration, claiming the actual number of immigrants "always ends up to be more than quadruple their stated number."
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or use nationalistic symbols to make its argument.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language to influence the reader, such as referring to a political opponent as an "idol": "When in fact, their idol, Obama did the same thing for years during his time in power."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular; instead, it presents its ideas as a hidden truth.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue by claiming the current immigration policy is a "planned event by the US government going all the way back to the domestic military exercises known as Jade Helm in 2015."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague phrasing to imply a conspiracy without providing clear evidence, for example: "This, along with the federal government grab of millions of acres of land during the Obama years, speaks volumes in the government's plan..."
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does not cite any experts or authorities to support its central claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two extreme outcomes for the immigration issue, dismissing all other options: "If they were, there would be no detention and separation after illegally coming into the US, only an immediate deportation by US Border Patrol on the spot."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a phrase to shut down nuance and present a simplified conclusion, stating: "The bottom line is, both the Left and the Trump Administration seem to be following along with a plan of action going back to Jade Helm".
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the tenuously related "Jade Helm" military exercises and the takeover of "Walmart locations" to distract from the specific policy debate and build a larger, more sinister conspiracy narrative.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an oversimplified version of its opponents' argument, stating that the idea of separating children being "something new, done only by the Trump Administration is absurd," ignoring the more nuanced critiques about the scale and systematic nature of the policy.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text's primary strategy is to deflect criticism of the Trump administration by charging the previous administration with hypocrisy: "actors on the Left accusing the Trump Administration of being cruel and insensitive... When in fact, their idol, Obama did the same thing".

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. It employs a vast majority of the listed techniques to promote a biased, conspiratorial narrative rather than to inform the reader. Its core argument is built on whataboutism, deflecting any criticism of one political side by accusing the other of the same or worse. It weaves a narrative of a secret, overarching government plan by using causal oversimplification (blaming "Jade Helm"), appeal to fear (a plan to "handle millions"), and red herrings (Walmart stores). The article is saturated with loaded language ("Leftists," "idol," "illegals"), name-calling, and exaggeration to manipulate the reader's emotions and discredit opponents. The heavy and deliberate use of these manipulative techniques confirms its nature as propaganda.
