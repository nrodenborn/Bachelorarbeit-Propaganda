1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes a source describing Iran’s government as a “tyrannical regime” and the “world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The phrase “regime change” is repeated constantly throughout the article, appearing in the headline and multiple paragraphs to reinforce the central theme.
3. Slogans – No – The text reports on statements made by others but does not employ its own brief, memorable phrases to rally the audience.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states that without regime change, “America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The opening line, “It appears Rudy Giuliani wasn’t lying,” is designed to cast doubt on those who may have previously dismissed his claims about a policy of regime change.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text includes John Bolton’s prediction of celebrating in Tehran “before 2019,” which is an exaggerated timeline for a complex geopolitical event like regime change.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not directly appeal to the audience's sense of patriotism to support its claims.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people” and “malign activities” to evoke a strong emotional response.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or group to the Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The article does not suggest that the reader should support the idea because it is already popular; in fact, it presents the plan as a relatively secret one.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text quotes a source claiming the “chief impediment to the region is Iran’s tyrannical regime” and that the administration will deal with the “root cause of chaos and violence in the region,” simplifying a highly complex geopolitical situation down to a single cause.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text relies heavily on anonymous sourcing like “One source close to the White House,” “a second source,” and “Regional sources,” which is intentionally vague and prevents the reader from verifying the information or judging the source’s credibility.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites National Security Adviser John Bolton and the Security Studies Group (described as having “close ties to senior White House national security officials”) to lend credibility to the regime change plan.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy: “Absent a change in government within Iran, America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases or clichés intended to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – The article remains focused on the central topic of the alleged regime change plan for Iran and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or create a false version of an opponent's argument in order to refute it.
18. Whataboutism – No – While the text contrasts the Trump administration’s policy with the Obama administration’s, it does not use this comparison to accuse an opponent of hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to objectively inform but to persuade the audience to accept a specific, alarmist narrative about US foreign policy toward Iran. This is achieved through the heavy and combined use of numerous propaganda techniques.

The article employs emotional manipulation through **Loaded Language** (“tyrannical regime,” “iron sandal”) and **Name Calling** to create a strong negative bias against the Iranian government. It uses **Appeal to Fear** by presenting a stark **Black & White Fallacy**: either support regime change or accept a nuclear-armed Iran, ignoring all other diplomatic possibilities.

Furthermore, it builds a sense of authority and insider knowledge through **Appeal to Authority** (citing Bolton and a White House-connected think tank) while simultaneously using **Obfuscation** (anonymous sources) to make its claims unverifiable. The argument is built on a **Causal Oversimplification**, blaming the entire region's instability on a single "root cause." The central message is hammered home through constant **Repetition** of the phrase "regime change."

While it reports on a supposedly "leaked" document, the framing, selective information, and the sheer density of these persuasive techniques indicate that the article's intent is to shape public opinion in a specific direction rather than to provide a balanced and verifiable account of events.
