2. Repetition – Yes – The question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase “It’s sharia compliance in New Mexico” is a brief and memorable phrase used to summarize a complex accusation.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting that a “jihad compound” existed for years without law enforcement action and that authorities are now engaged in a cover-up, implying a broader threat to public safety due to “sharia compliance.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The text explicitly questions the credibility of law enforcement by stating, “They destroyed evidence, despite the fact that the investigation was new and ongoing” and accusing them of a cover-up.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the motive of law enforcement, claiming their top priority is “making Islam look good” and that their actions are “sharia compliance in New Mexico,” which is an extreme interpretation presented without evidence.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations, not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does not use the support of an authority figure as evidence for its claims; instead, it attacks the credibility of authorities like the FBI.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy regarding the actions of law enforcement: either they are competent and unbiased, or they are actively covering up for Muslims out of “sharia compliance,” ignoring any other possible explanations for their actions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “It’s sharia compliance in New Mexico” acts as a thought-terminating cliché, offering a simplistic and emotionally charged explanation that discourages critical examination of the actual events and motives.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll about Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation, which is completely irrelevant to the topic of the New Mexico compound, serving as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an unstated argument that law enforcement is infallible by accusing them of a cover-up, rather than engaging with the actual, specific reasons or statements law enforcement might have given for their actions.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text accuses law enforcement of negligence and conspiracy, but it does not use the specific tactic of deflecting criticism by pointing out the hypocrisy of an opponent.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and overt piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader by appealing to emotion and employing numerous logical fallacies. The article uses a high density of propaganda techniques, including emotionally loaded language ("Horrifying," "Deadly"), name-calling ("Jihadi Muslims"), and appeals to fear to create a strong negative emotional response. It builds a narrative of a conspiracy by casting doubt on the motives of law enforcement and using causal oversimplification to attribute their actions to a single, sinister cause: "sharia compliance." This unsupported claim is presented as a black-and-white fallacy, ignoring all other potential explanations. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Brett Kavanaugh poll) further demonstrates that the article's intent is not journalistic but manipulative, likely for political engagement and data collection. The combination of these techniques shows a deliberate effort to shape the reader's perception and promote a specific, biased agenda.
