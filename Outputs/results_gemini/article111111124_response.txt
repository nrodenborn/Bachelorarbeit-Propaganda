Verdict – 40% – The text is structured as a news report, detailing an event (the President's order) and presenting reactions from multiple, opposing sides (the administration, Republicans, and Democrats). In this way, it is not a straightforward piece of propaganda as it does not present a single, one-sided viewpoint. However, a very high number of propaganda techniques are present within the text. Crucially, most of these techniques are found in the direct quotes from political actors (e.g., Rep. Schiff's use of appeal to fear, exaggeration, and slogans) or in the justifications for their actions (e.g., the White House's use of bandwagon and appeal to authority). The article is reporting on the use of propaganda by political figures. At the same time, the article's own narrative voice uses loaded language ("hamstrung," "blasting," "disgraced") that frames the story with a particular bias, preventing it from being entirely neutral. Therefore, while its primary function is journalistic, its framing and heavy inclusion of propagandistic statements give it a significant propaganda component.
