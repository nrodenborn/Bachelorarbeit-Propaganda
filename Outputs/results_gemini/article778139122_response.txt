Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – John Pilger labels the mainstream media as “Vichy journalism,” comparing journalists who are critical of Assange to the French Vichy government that collaborated with the Nazis. He also calls the Australian government’s relationship with the US “servile” and the establishment “rapacious.”

2.  Repetition – Yes – The idea that Assange has not been charged with a crime is repeated multiple times, such as “Assange has not been charged with a single crime” and later, “There are no serious charges. He hasn’t been charged with anything.”

3.  Slogans – Yes – The text concludes with the memorable phrase, “In the world of human rights, silence equals mass murder,” which serves as a powerful, slogan-like statement to summarize the moral argument.

4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses the famous Martin Niemoller speech (“First they came for the socialists…”) to suggest that if people do not speak up for Assange, the same oppressive forces will eventually come for them. It also warns that letting Assange be taken to a “super-max hellhole” would be a “great atrocity” and the “conquest of all of us.”

5.  Doubt – Yes – Pilger questions the credibility and motives of the UK Foreign Secretary by asking, “Was Hunt referring to a deal which has already been done with the United States on extradition? I don’t know.” This casts suspicion on the government's actions.

6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Pilger exaggerates by claiming WikiLeaks is “probably the only journalistic organization that has a 100% record of accuracy and authenticity!” He also minimizes the Swedish investigation by calling them “bogus sexual assault charges.”

7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to Australian patriotism by criticizing its government for failing its duty to a citizen: “Julian could leave the embassy if his own government, the government of his homeland, Australia, applied legitimate diplomatic pressure on behalf of its citizen.”

8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like “persecution,” “witch hunt,” “vindictiveness,” “disgrace,” and “super-max hellhole” to evoke strong negative feelings towards Assange’s opponents and sympathy for him.

9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – Pilger explicitly compares mainstream journalists to the French Vichy government that collaborated with the Nazis, calling their work “Vichy journalism.” He also invokes a famous speech by Martin Niemoller about the rise of the Nazis.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text appeals to a specific group identity by stating the persecution of Assange “should horrify all free-thinking people,” implying that if you are a free-thinker, you will agree with this position.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Pilger simplifies the complex foreign policies of Britain and Australia by stating, “Everything comes down to the relationship with the United States.” He also suggests journalists attack Assange simply because “WikiLeaks has in fact shamed journalists.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – Pilger uses vague but sinister-sounding phrases like “milieu of machination” and “so-called ‘wretched deals’” without providing specific details, creating a sense of conspiracy and wrongdoing without needing to substantiate it.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The interviewer, Dennis Bernstein, introduces John Pilger as a significant authority. Pilger himself then cites the attorney for the New York Times to support the argument that prosecuting Assange is a threat to all journalism: “Even the attorney for the New York Times happened to mention that if Julian Assange gets prosecuted, the Times could get prosecuted under the same laws.”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a world of two sides: the heroic, independent truth-tellers (Assange/WikiLeaks) and the corrupt, servile establishment (governments and mainstream media). For example, “The difference with WikiLeaks is that it is outside of the establishment and is truly independent.” This ignores any nuance or middle ground.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Pilger’s statement, “It’s very simple. This is about justice,” is a phrase that attempts to end debate by framing the complex situation as a simple moral binary, discouraging further critical analysis.

16. Red herring – Yes – When asked about Assange the person, Pilger launches into a defense of the moral basis of WikiLeaks. While related, this shifts the focus from Assange’s personality and character to the ideology of his organization, distracting from the original question.

17. Straw men – Yes – Pilger brings up an unstated argument to refute it: “and now WikiLeaks is accused of being an agent of Russia!” He then immediately counters this by noting WikiLeaks has released documents from Russia, defeating a criticism that was not part of the immediate conversation.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – Pilger charges the Australian Prime Minister with hypocrisy: “Only seven years ago, the current prime minister said that when an Australian citizen is threatened in this way the prime minister should respond. That was Turnbull before he became prime minister.”

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the audience to adopt a very specific, one-sided viewpoint regarding Julian Assange, WikiLeaks, and their opponents. This is achieved through the heavy and consistent use of a wide array of propaganda techniques.

The speakers employ nearly every technique on the list to construct a simple, emotionally resonant narrative: Julian Assange is a heroic, principled martyr and a peerless journalist, while the governments of the US, UK, and Australia, along with the entire mainstream media, are a corrupt, servile, and vindictive monolith persecuting him.

Techniques like **Name Calling** (“Vichy journalism”), **Loaded Language** (“persecution,” “witch hunt”), and **Reduction ad Hitlerum** are used to demonize the opposition. A **Black & White Fallacy** is established, leaving no room for nuance—you are either with the “free-thinking people” who support Assange or you are part of the corrupt establishment. **Appeal to Fear** is used powerfully with the Niemoller analogy to create a sense of personal threat and urgency.

The argument is bolstered by **Exaggeration** (WikiLeaks’ 100% accuracy) and **Causal Oversimplification** (blaming everything on the US relationship). Dissenting or complex issues are dismissed with **Thought-Terminating Clichés** (“This is about justice”) or minimized (“bogus sexual assault charges”).

While the text contains factual elements (e.g., names of politicians, the existence of WikiLeaks documents), these facts are exclusively framed to support the central argument. The entire piece, structured as an interview with a passionate advocate, is designed to elicit and amplify this propagandistic message, making it a clear and powerful example of persuasive, rather than objective, communication.
