Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

### Propaganda Technique Analysis
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Molester McCarrick", "swarmy power brokers", "lavender mafia", "clever and tyrannical Bergoglio", "St. Gallen Mafia", "don, Jorge Bergoglio".  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated emphasis on "5 years" (referencing the alleged reform timeline), "homosexual agenda", "McCarrick scandal", and "Synod".  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "#StopTheSynod" (memorable hashtag used as a rallying cry).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings about children being "exploited", seminarians "violated", "homosexual orgy covered up", and the Synod "exploiting youth".  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Will Catholic laity pay attention?", "Are you thoroughly disgusted?", "Explain to Catholics why...".  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "most prolific serial predator Cardinal", "cascading revelations... toppling the barque of Peter". Minimization: Downplaying Church reforms as a "homosexual agenda".  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to Catholic identity: "reclaim our hijacked Catholic Church", "Holy Mother Church", "protect the Church".  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Predators", "exploit", "violated", "conspiracy of denial", "hijacked", "purge", "radical hijacking".  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or Hitler.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "Catholics don’t trust... are furious", "We are no longer shocked, just fed up" (implying collective sentiment).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames Church crises solely on a "homosexual agenda" and Bergoglio’s "5-year plan".  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Accusations are direct, not obscured.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authoritative sources cited; authorities (e.g., Pope, bishops) are discredited.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents only two options: Purge homosexuals or enable abuse (e.g., "Purge every homosexual... or risk exploitation").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" used to halt discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions; all arguments tie back to the main theme.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents the Synod’s goal as "exploiting youth" and a "Gay Pride Rally" rather than discussing faith/vocations.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting specific critics.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation  
The text is **overwhelmingly propagandistic** due to:  
1. **Extensive Use of Propaganda Techniques**: It employs 14/18 techniques analyzed, including pervasive *name-calling* (e.g., "Molester McCarrick"), *fear appeals* (imminent harm to youth), *loaded language* ("predators," "hijacked"), and *oversimplification* (reducing complex issues to a "homosexual agenda").  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Language is inflammatory and accusatory, designed to provoke anger/disgust (e.g., "homosexual orgy," "exploit the youth") rather than encourage critical analysis.  
3. **Conspiracy Framing**: Portrays Church leadership as a coordinated "lavender mafia" executing a secretive "5-year plan" to undermine tradition, ignoring structural or systemic factors.  
4. **Dichotomous Narrative**: Creates a false binary—depicting the Church as corrupted by predatory homosexuals versus a "pure" institution to be "reclaimed"—suppressing nuance.  
5. **Call to Action**: Concludes with a directive ("#StopTheSynod") framed as moral necessity, leveraging scandal to mobilize readers against Church events.  
6. **Source Bias**: The author (a child rights advocate investigating clergy abuse) has a clear agenda, using selective scandal narratives to generalize guilt across the hierarchy.  

**Why not 100%?**  
The text references factual events (McCarrick’s crimes, Farrell’s ties to McCarrick), but these are weaponized to support a reductive, emotionally charged narrative. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the basis in real scandals, though their presentation is unequivocally propagandistic.
