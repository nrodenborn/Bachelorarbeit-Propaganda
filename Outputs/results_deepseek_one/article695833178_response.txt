Here's the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique, followed by a verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Authorities LIED" (headline), "FBI specifically lied" (text). Uses insulting labels ("lied," "misled") to attack authorities/FBI.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: Repeatedly states authorities/FBI "lied" or "misled" about the check-in date and license plate number.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: "What Else Are They Hiding?" (headline). A brief, memorable phrase framing the narrative.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: "This throws their entire narrative into question and makes one wonder what else is being hidden from the public?" Instills fear/distrust of authorities and implies dangerous secrets.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Continuously questions the credibility of authorities, FBI, police, and mainstream media ("every piece of so-called evidence... cannot be trusted").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Shockingly" (emphasizing license plate discrepancy), "literally every piece of so-called evidence... cannot be trusted" (exaggerating the scope of distrust).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Authorities LIED", "horrific shooting", "covering up", "misled public", "cannot be trusted", "disinformation". Emotionally charged words.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparison to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Explanation: References "alternative media" investigations, "many different theories," and the Drudge Report linking to critical articles to imply growing popular support for skepticism.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Implies that lies about specific details (check-in date, license plate) *prove* the entire official narrative is false and a cover-up ("This throws their entire narrative into question").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The claims are specific (check-in date, license plate, videos) rather than deliberately vague.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Relies heavily on the reports and tweets of "investigative reporter Laura Loomer" as evidence.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents authorities as entirely untrustworthy ("literally every piece... cannot be trusted") and their narrative as false disinformation, implying the alternative theories must be true.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: "cannot be trusted", "should be considered as disinformation". Phrases used to dismiss the official narrative without further critical examination.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: Introduces Eric Paddock's "bizarre interviews" and the existence of security camera footage near the van as reasons to doubt the lone gunman theory, distracting from the core claims being challenged (check-in date, license plate).
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: Portrays the official stance simplistically as "Paddock really did act alone" and then attacks that simplified position with peripheral details (brother's interviews, camera location), implying authorities deny any inconsistencies or unanswered questions.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: Does not charge opponents with hypocrisy on a different issue.

**Verdict – 85% –** Explanation: The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques (at least 13 out of 18 identified). Its core purpose is to discredit official authorities (FBI, police) and mainstream media by selectively presenting evidence (Loomer's reports) while employing loaded language, fear appeals, repetition, and fallacious reasoning (causal oversimplification, black & white fallacy). It actively promotes distrust ("cannot be trusted," "disinformation") and pushes alternative narratives ("multiple shooters," "ISIS connection," "cover-up") without conclusive proof, primarily relying on perceived inconsistencies. The sensationalist headline ("LIED," "What Else Are They Hiding?") and reliance on a single alternative media source further align with propaganda aimed at shaping perception and undermining established accounts rather than presenting a neutral investigation. While based on some factual claims (e.g., discrepancies reported by Loomer), the framing, language, and logical fallacies overwhelmingly serve a propagandistic purpose.
