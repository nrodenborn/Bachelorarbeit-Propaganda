**Verdict – 85% –**  
The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements through its selective framing and use of persuasive techniques. Key indicators include:  
1. **Emotional Manipulation:** Loaded language ("disgraceful," "murderer," "criminal aliens") and appeals to fear (linking immigration policies to public danger) dominate the narrative.  
2. **Oversimplification:** The complex legal case (accidental shooting, ricochet, conflicting defendant statements) is reduced to "sanctuary cities cause deaths," ignoring exonerating evidence presented at trial.  
3. **Authority & Bandwagon:** Quotes from Trump, Sessions, and outraged social media amplify a singular viewpoint while marginalizing the jury’s verdict as illegitimate.  
4. **Political Agenda:** Explicit emphasis on "#KatesLaw" and "#BuildTheWall" ties the tragedy to pre-existing immigration policy debates, framing the verdict as evidence for stricter enforcement.  
5. **Omission of Context:** No mention of the jury’s rationale (e.g., accidental discharge, lack of intent) or the defense’s arguments, creating a one-sided portrayal.  

While based on a real event, the text’s structure—headline sensationalism, cherry-picked quotes, omission of exculpatory details, and reliance on emotional triggers—aligns with propaganda aimed at reinforcing anti-immigration narratives rather than objective reporting. The 15% non-propaganda allowance accounts for factual reporting of the verdict, tweets, and Sessions’ statement.
