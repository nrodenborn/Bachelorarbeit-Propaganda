Verdict – 85% – The text employs multiple propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, black & white fallacy, red herring, and straw men. These techniques are used to discredit Bharath Ganesh's research and suggest a conspiracy involving European governments and internet giants. The presence of these techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is propaganda, aiming to manipulate the audience's perception and emotions rather than providing a balanced analysis.
