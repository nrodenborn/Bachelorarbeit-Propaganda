1. Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack Mohamad Khweis or ISIS. It uses the official name of the organization, "the Islamic State," and refers to the subject by his name.
2. Repetition – No – The text is a short news report and does not repeat any single message or phrase.
3. Slogans – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – No – While the subject of ISIS can be fear-inducing, the article does not use this fear to support an idea or warn against alternatives. It reports on a past event.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text reports that the prosecution actively cast doubt on the defendant's credibility. Explanation: "Prosecutors, who pushed for 35 years in prison, accused Khweis of lying repeatedly over the last 15 months of the trial."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text reports facts and quotes from a legal case without obvious exaggeration or minimization by the author.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions Khweis is an "American citizen," which is a factual descriptor for context, not an appeal to patriotism to sway the reader's opinion.
8. Loaded Language – No – The text uses neutral, reportorial language. Terms like "Islamic State" or "caliphate" are standard and not used with additional emotional modifiers.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – This technique is not used. The article is about a group (ISIS) directly, not using that group to discredit a separate idea.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is popular and therefore correct.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does the opposite; it explicitly states that the cause of Khweis's actions is complex and unknown. Explanation: “We don’t really know what caused him to travel to Syria.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is written with clarity, reporting the known facts of the case.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites multiple authorities to report its information. Explanation: "The Washington Post reports," "defense attorney John Zwerling said Friday," and "prosecutor Dennis Fitzpatrick said."
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present the situation as a simple choice between two options. It acknowledges the complexities of the case.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases designed to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – All the information presented, such as Khweis's background and the prosecution's arguments, is relevant to the legal case being reported.
17. Straw men – No – The text reports on the arguments made by the prosecution and defense in the actual trial, not on misrepresented or fabricated arguments.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 10% – The text is highly unlikely to be propaganda. It functions as a standard news report on a legal proceeding. Although it technically uses "Appeal to authority" and reports on the use of "Doubt," these are employed in a journalistic context. Citing sources like other publications, lawyers, and prosecutors is a fundamental practice of reporting to establish facts, not to manipulate. Similarly, reporting that the prosecution cast doubt on the defendant's testimony is a factual account of the trial's events, not a technique used by the author to persuade the audience. The article lacks the key hallmarks of propaganda, such as emotional manipulation, loaded language, name-calling, and oversimplification. In fact, it does the opposite of oversimplification by highlighting the mysterious and complex nature of the defendant's radicalization.
