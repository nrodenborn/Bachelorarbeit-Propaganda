Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Soros-Funded Lawyers" (negative label implying undue influence), "Globalist billionaire George Soros" ("globalist" often used pejoratively), "illegal aliens" (pejorative term).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "caravan migrants" is repeated multiple times throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, standalone, memorable phrase used as a slogan within the text itself (though "BUILD THE WALL!" is mentioned as a tweet, it's not the article's slogan).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Descriptions like "rush the border", "impending migrant 'invasion'", "barbed wire", "riot gear", "razor wire", and troop deployments create a sense of threat and danger.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "None of these are eligible asylum claims, Breitbart reports." casts doubt on the legitimacy of the migrants' claims. Also, implying Soros' involvement casts doubt on the motives of the lawyers/migrants.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "impending migrant 'invasion'" exaggerates the threat. Minimizing potential legitimacy of claims: "mostly consists of migrants with ineligible asylum claims".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Descriptions of US troop deployments ("5,200 troops", "Operation Faithful Patriot", "drones, helicopters") and border security efforts ("blocking the lanes", "barbed wire", "barriers") appeal to patriotism and national defense.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Soros-Funded", "Globalist", "under the guise of seeking asylum", "rush the border", "illegal aliens", "invasion", "thwart". These words carry strong negative connotations and emotional weight.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison made to Hitler, Nazis, or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to the popularity of the idea being promoted within the text.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames George Soros's funding as a primary cause ("Soros-Funded Lawyers Helping...", "Globalist billionaire George Soros is backing attorney’s who are helping...") for the migrants seeking asylum, simplifying a complex migration event.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – The Jim Acosta poll ("take our poll - story continues below Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?") is completely irrelevant and placed confusingly within the article, distracting from the main topic.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Repeatedly cites Breitbart News ("Breitbart reports", "as Breitbart News reported") as an authoritative source for claims about ineligible asylum claims and protests.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents migrants as either legitimate asylum seekers or "job-seekers, previously deported illegal aliens, and Central Americans looking to get away from crime" (implying crime isn't a valid reason), and states "None of these are eligible asylum claims". Ignores nuances of asylum law and individual circumstances.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" or "common sense" used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The entire section about the Jim Acosta poll ("take our poll - story continues below Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?...") is completely irrelevant to the topic of the migrant caravan or Soros-funded lawyers and serves only to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text does not explicitly refute an argument that wasn't presented. It presents its own narrative but doesn't misrepresent a counter-argument to knock it down.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not charge an opponent with hypocrisy on an unrelated issue.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It heavily relies on established propaganda techniques: **Name Calling** ("Soros-Funded", "Globalist", "illegal aliens"), **Appeal to Fear** ("rush", "invasion", security measures), **Loaded Language** (throughout), **Flag-Waving** (troop deployment), **Causal Oversimplification** (blaming Soros), **Doubt** (casting aspersions on asylum claims), **Black & White Fallacy** (oversimplifying eligibility), **Repetition** ("caravan migrants"), and a blatant **Red Herring** (Jim Acosta poll). The sourcing is heavily skewed (Breitbart), the language is consistently inflammatory and one-sided, and the primary goal appears to be framing the migrant caravan as a nefarious invasion facilitated by a shadowy billionaire, rather than providing a neutral report on events or legal assistance. The inclusion of the irrelevant poll further undermines its journalistic integrity, solidifying its propagandistic nature.
