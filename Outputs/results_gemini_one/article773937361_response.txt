1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels certain figures and groups with insulting terms, such as calling German bishops “manifestly evil and apostate men” and referring to corrupt clergy as “wolves”.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the idea that the institutional Church is corrupt and has been taken over by enemies, and that faithful Catholics must take practical, material action to survive. This is seen in the recurring contrast between the “Old Paradigm” and the “New Paradigm” and the repeated calls for financial independence for priests.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the phrase “The Purge has started” to create a sense of urgent crisis. The title itself, “What’s Your Trade?”, is used as a memorable, action-oriented phrase to encapsulate the article's main advice.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that priests who do not become materially independent can be rendered “homeless, penniless and jobless” by a corrupt bishop. It also warns of a “general collapse of the institution” and a “Purge” to instill fear in the reader about the consequences of inaction.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on the credibility of the entire Catholic hierarchy, including those labeled the “‘good’ bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal”. The footnote on Cardinal Farrell is a detailed attempt to raise suspicion about his past and connections.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to heighten the sense of crisis, for example, by claiming that “nearly the entire episcopate of the United States either colluded directly or kept quiet about it,” which is a sweeping and unsubstantiated generalization.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the reader’s identity as a faithful, traditional Catholic. It frames the conflict as a struggle to preserve “the authentic Catholic life” and the “Deposit of the Faith” against internal enemies, urging “we who still love the Church” to take action.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases designed to evoke strong reactions, such as “furious mobs,” “lame whitewashing attempt,” “grotesquely corrupt,” “manifestly evil and apostate men,” and “ravening eyes.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text compares the current situation to historical persecutions, likening the necessary actions to those of the curators of the Hermitage Museum “in the face of the advancing German army” during the Siege of Leningrad, and also to the plight of Catholics in “the England of Henry VIII.”
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that a growing number of people are coming to the same conclusions. It states, “It has shown the world what Traditionalists have known,” and cites other writers like Rod Dreher, Steve Skojec, and John Zmirak to show that this viewpoint is shared and gaining traction.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex crisis in the modern Catholic Church to a single root cause: “The Church was infiltrated, we know this, in the 19th century by some pretty dark forces, and they have finally come into the ascendancy”.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is generally direct and clear in its accusations and its proposed course of action. While it uses broad terms like “dark forces,” its central message and call to action are not deliberately obscured.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites sympathetic writers and figures as authorities to bolster its arguments, such as when it says, “Rod Dreher is doing excellent work compiling testimony…” and quotes Steve Skojec and John Zmirak.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark choice between two options: “The Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else.” It frames the situation as a choice between total corruption and the radical solutions it proposes, ignoring any possibility of internal reform or moderate positions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that present its conclusions as foregone and not open to debate. For example, “The simple fact is that soon there are going to be ‘vagus’ priests” is stated as an inevitability to shut down discussion about whether this outcome is certain or preventable.
16. Red herring – Yes – The long footnote detailing Cardinal Farrell’s history is a diversion. While it reinforces the theme of corruption, it distracts from the main article’s argument about the practical steps laypeople and priests should take, instead serving as a detailed, ad hominem attack to further discredit the hierarchy.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text sets up and refutes the argument that the scandal is the result of just one “‘bad apple’ or even only a ‘few’”. By attributing this weak argument to its opponents (the “hapless ‘conservative’ Bishop Tobin”), it can easily knock it down and make its own claim of systemic corruption seem stronger.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses on direct accusations of corruption and evil rather than deflecting criticism by pointing out the hypocrisy of its opponents in the typical “what about you?” format.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, radical viewpoint and course of action. It achieves this by employing a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques in a dense and overlapping manner. The text systematically builds an "us vs. them" narrative by using Name Calling ("wolves," "evil men") and Flag-Waving (appealing to "faithful Catholics"). It manipulates the reader's emotions through a constant stream of Loaded Language ("furious mobs," "rotting thing") and Appeals to Fear (threats of being "homeless and penniless," a "general collapse"). The argument simplifies a complex reality into a Black & White Fallacy (the "Old Paradigm" vs. the "New Paradigm") and a Causal Oversimplification (blaming "dark forces" from the 19th century). The author attempts to shut down critical thought by using Straw Men and Thought-Terminating Clichés, while bolstering their position with Appeals to Authority. The sheer concentration of these techniques, all aimed at dismantling trust in an established institution and promoting a specific, alternative agenda, makes this a clear and potent example of propaganda.
