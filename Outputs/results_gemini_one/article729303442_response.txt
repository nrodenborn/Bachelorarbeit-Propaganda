Name calling – Yes – Michael Mostyn, CEO of B’nai Brith Canada, called the report a “whitewash.”

Repetition – No – The text reports on different viewpoints and does not repeat a single message.

Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The joint statement from Jewish groups suggests a fearful future, stating the report “insinuates that Jewish students who engage with mainstream Jewish community organizations are permitted to be precluded from holding political office.”

Doubt – Yes – Jewish groups question the credibility of the report, stating it is “flawed” and that it “fundamentally misunderstands this, which alters the entire findings of the report.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The Boudreau report minimizes the role of anti-Semitism by concluding the vote was based on politics, while Michael Mostyn’s claim that the report is a “whitewash” is an exaggeration.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The conflict is framed around identity. Noah Lew is quoted as saying, “My Jewish identity was now public, and a target was placed squarely upon me by the McGill BDS movement.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The term “whitewash” is used to evoke a strong emotional reaction against the report. The text also references “anti-Semitic tropes of Jewish people as corrupt and politically powerful.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text discusses anti-Semitism but does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The arguments presented are not based on the popularity of an idea.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The official report is accused of this by concluding the vote was “motivated by politics,” thereby simplifying a complex event that others argue was rooted in anti-Semitism.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The principal’s concluding statement is vague, promising to “remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe, welcomed and respected” without addressing the specific criticisms of the report.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The article centers on the findings of an official investigation ordered by the principal: “an investigation ordered by the principal has concluded.” The conclusion of this authority is used as evidence.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The core debate is framed as a binary choice: the vote was either due to “political disagreement” or “anti-Semitism,” ignoring the possibility that the two are intertwined or that both factors were at play.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The principal’s statement that “there is absolutely no place for anti-Semitism at McGill University” is a cliché used to shut down further debate by stating an obvious and agreeable principle without addressing the specific conflict.

Red herring – No – All the arguments and information presented in the text are relevant to the central controversy.

Straw men – Yes – The Jewish groups’ statement refutes an argument that the report likely did not make explicitly: that the report “insinuates that Jewish students who engage with mainstream Jewish community organizations are permitted to be precluded from holding political office.”

Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain any instances of charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 85% – The text is a news article reporting on a conflict between multiple parties. While the journalist's tone is largely neutral, the article acts as a vehicle for the propaganda techniques being used by the subjects of the report. The text is saturated with these techniques from nearly every quoted source. The university report uses Appeal to Authority and Causal Oversimplification. The critics of the report (Jewish groups, B'nai Brith) use Name Calling ("whitewash"), Doubt, Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear, and Straw Men. The university administration uses Obfuscation and Thought-terminating clichés to manage the situation. Because the article's primary function is to present this "propaganda vs. counter-propaganda" battle, and it contains a very high number of identified techniques (12 out of 18), it is highly likely to function as propaganda by exposing the reader to these competing, emotionally charged, and logically flawed narratives.
