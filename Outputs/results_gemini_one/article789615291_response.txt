1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels for its opponents, such as calling Democrats "rabid partisans and office-seekers," referring to Michael Avenatti as a "Creepy Lawyer," and describing some senators as "knuckle-dragging Neanderthal sexists."

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly hammers home the central message that Republicans are "appeasing" Democrats and that the Democrats' goal is simply to "delay" the confirmation. Phrases and ideas like "delaying tactic," "obstruct and delay," "more demands," and "appeasing an aggressor" are used throughout the text to reinforce this single point.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses a brief, memorable, and forceful phrase to cap its argument: "How about acting on principle for a change and shoot the alligator."

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by claiming that if Kavanaugh is not confirmed, progressives will succeed in their "dream of government controlled and managed by a technocratic oligarchy" and that the "Constitutional order must be subverted by the Supreme Court."

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is an exercise in casting doubt on the credibility of the accusers and the Democratic party. For example, it states, "Ramirez wasn’t even sure her memory was correct — until she spent six days going over it with her Democrat lawyer."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the opposition by describing them as "trendoid socialists armed with torches and pitch-forks," while minimizing the allegations against Kavanaugh by calling them a "naked ploy" and "flimsy."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and American principles by framing the conflict as a defense of the Constitution against progressives. Example: "But if Kavanaugh is confirmed, there will be five reliably Constitutionalist justices on the bench, who are unlikely to tolerate judicial usurpation of Congress’s law-making powers."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words intended to sway the reader. Example: "The point is to delay confirmation by slandering Kavanaugh and baiting the Republicans into appearing to abuse victims of sexual assault."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text invokes the appeasement of aggressive regimes before WWII to discredit the Republican strategy of making concessions. Example: "To borrow Churchill’s definition of appeasement, stop feeding the alligator in the hopes that you will be eaten last."

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of its own idea. Instead, it argues against what it portrays as a popular bandwagon, namely the "#MeToo movement" and the feminist narrative it claims Republicans are afraid to challenge.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex situation of the sexual assault allegations to a single, simple cause: a political stunt. Example: "Given that the Democrats had made public in advance their intention to derail the hearings and confirmation by any means possible, the timing of both sexual assault charges reeks of premeditated contrivance intended to delay confirmation as long as possible."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's argument, while one-sided, is presented directly and bluntly. It does not use vague or obscure language to confuse the audience; its intent is very clear.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites authorities to support its claims, most notably Winston Churchill. Example: "To borrow Churchill’s definition of appeasement, stop feeding the alligator in the hopes that you will be eaten last."

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a simple choice between two extremes: either Republicans fight back aggressively or they face certain "defeat" and are "demonized." Example: "Republicans still don’t get that no amount of appeasement will stop the left from demonizing them anyway."

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases to shut down debate by presenting its premise as an unassailable fact. Example: "From the playground to geopolitics, appeasing an aggressor invites only more aggression. This timeless truth of human nature is one that we moderns can’t seem to accept."

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces an irrelevant topic to distract from the matter at hand and attack the opponent's credibility. Example: "doesn’t Keith Ellison’s accuser deserve to be heard and believed too?"

17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the opposing argument to make it easier to attack, claiming feminists insist that "every accusation of sexual assault, no matter how much it’s unsupported by corroborating evidence or even plausibility, must be believed," which is an oversimplification of the actual position.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text directly charges opponents with hypocrisy to deflect from the argument. Example: "Given how obviously partisan and hypocritical this ploy is––doesn’t Keith Ellison’s accuser deserve to be heard and believed too?"

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast majority (16 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques not as incidental elements, but as the fundamental structure of its argument. The piece is not a reasoned analysis but a persuasive effort designed to provoke an emotional response (anger, fear, contempt) and solidify a partisan viewpoint. It systematically uses name-calling ("rabid partisans"), loaded language ("slandering," "smears"), and appeals to fear (the subversion of the Constitution) to demonize the opposition. It relies heavily on logical fallacies like causal oversimplification (the allegations are just a "ploy"), whataboutism (bringing up Keith Ellison), and the black & white fallacy (appease and be defeated, or fight and win). The author's goal is not to inform or foster understanding of a complex issue, but to rally a political base, discredit opponents, and advocate for a specific, aggressive course of action, which are all hallmarks of propaganda.
