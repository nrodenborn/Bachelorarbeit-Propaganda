### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text  
**1. Name calling** – **Yes** – "global elite puppets" (referring to Hillary Clinton, Obama, Bush), "Deep State," "corporateocracy."  
**2. Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on "censorship," "independent media deletion," and "Deep State control" (e.g., "Facebook has completely shut down hundreds..."; "These pages... were deleted").  
**3. Slogans** – **Yes** – "We don’t need fact checkers, we ourselves should be those fact checkers!" and "The answer to bad speech is not censorship, the answer to bad speech is more speech."  
**4. Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings about loss of freedom, democracy, and an impending "total dictatorship" (e.g., "Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means").  
**5. Doubt** – **Yes** – Undermines mainstream media and authority figures (e.g., "what they see coming from the mainstream is usually highly suspect and questionable").  
**6. Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates Facebook's actions ("complete deletion of multiple pages") and minimizes mainstream media credibility ("manipulating the public").  
**7. Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to patriotism via JFK quote about "free and open society" and references to "democracy," "Liberty," and "Constitution."  
**8. Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotional terms like "repugnant," "grave danger," "vilified," "Orwellian state," "corruption," and "elite pedophilia."  
**9. Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis.  
**10. Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Claims a growing mass awakening (e.g., "More and more people see it this way because our consciousness continues to shift").  
**11. Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames complex issues (e.g., media censorship) on a single cause: "the elite preserving their control."  
**12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Vague references to "revelations" and "plans in the middle east" without specifics.  
**13. Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Quotes JFK, Edward Snowden, Einstein, and William Jenner to validate arguments.  
**14. Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents media as either "independent" (truthful) or "mainstream" (corrupt), e.g., "Independent media brought to light facts... mainstream media [is] manipulating the public."  
**15. Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Phrases like "the shift will continue to happen" and "change will continue to happen" discourage deeper analysis.  
**16. Red herring** – **Yes** – Introduces GMO labeling and cell phone towers (unrelated to media censorship) to distract.  
**17. Straw men** – **Yes** – Attributes unsupported arguments to opponents, e.g., claims critics dismiss revelations as "conspiracy theories" without evidence.  
**18. Whataboutism** – **No** – No direct accusations of hypocrisy targeting opponents.

### Final Verdict  
**Verdict – 95%** – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It systematically employs **15 of 18 techniques** (e.g., loaded language, fear appeals, black-and-white framing) to advance a narrative of systemic oppression by a hidden "Deep State." It demonizes opponents ("global elite puppets"), oversimplifies causality (blaming elites for all societal ills), and uses emotional manipulation (patriotism, fear of dictatorship) to bypass critical scrutiny. While it cites legitimate concerns about media censorship, these are embedded in a conspiratorial framework that dismisses counter-evidence (e.g., labeling mainstream media inherently corrupt). The heavy reliance on authoritative quotes (Snowden, JFK) and slogans ("We don’t need fact checkers") further signals intent to persuade, not inform. The 5% uncertainty stems from partial factual basis (e.g., Facebook’s page removals), but the text’s structure, tone, and techniques align overwhelmingly with propaganda.
