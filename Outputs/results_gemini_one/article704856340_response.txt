Name calling – Yes – The text uses the label “Vegas cover-up” to attack the official investigation, implying intentional deceit.

Repetition – Yes – The core idea of multiple shooters and a flawed official narrative is repeated throughout the text. Examples include: “even more proof that there were multiple shooters,” “another active shooter up there,” “active multiple terrorists moving through the hotel,” “yet another instance of a possible second shooter,” and “active shooters on the runway.”

Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief, memorable phrase as a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear of a hidden, powerful entity by concluding that the evidence points towards a “classic deep state false flag operation,” implying that a secret part of the government is orchestrating horrific events to manipulate its citizens.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is built on casting doubt on the official account. For example: “further debunking the official narrative of a lone gunman on the 32nd floor and once again calling into question almost every aspect of what actually happened”.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the certainty and scope of its claims, such as calling into question “almost every aspect of what actually happened” and citing a “shocking amount of evidence.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text makes a subtle appeal to patriotism by stating that authorities are “desperately trying to prevent it from reaching the American people,” framing the issue as a conspiracy against the nation's citizens.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader’s perception. Examples include “massacre,” “cover-up,” “frantically,” “horrific attack,” and “desperately.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text creates the impression that belief in a conspiracy is widespread and growing, stating the new report “comes on the heels of dozens of similar reports.”

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not propose a simple cause for a complex event; instead, it suggests a complex conspiracy (“deep state false flag operation”) as the cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – While the term “deep state” is vague, the article’s main point is stated clearly and directly rather than being intentionally obscured.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites various sources as evidence, presenting them as authorities on the matter. Examples include: “Clark County Fire Department,” “Intellihub’s Shepard Ambellas,” “author and entrepreneur Grant Cardone,” and “air traffic control recordings.”

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: the official narrative of a lone gunman, or the “truth” of a multi-shooter conspiracy and cover-up, ignoring any possibility of simple confusion or erroneous reports in the chaos of the event.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “classic deep state false flag operation” serves to end critical thought by providing a simple, all-encompassing explanation for any and all contradictory or confusing evidence.

Red herring – No – The text stays focused on its central claim of multiple shooters and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from it.

Straw men – No – The text attacks the actual “official narrative” of a lone gunman; it does not invent a weaker argument to refute.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse its opponents of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform objectively but to persuade the reader to distrust the official account of the Las Vegas shooting and adopt a specific conspiratorial viewpoint. This is achieved through the heavy and repeated use of numerous propaganda techniques. The article is built on a foundation of **Doubt**, using emotionally **Loaded Language** ("cover-up," "massacre") and **Exaggeration** ("shocking amount of evidence") to create a sense of crisis. It employs the **Bandwagon** technique by referencing "dozens of similar reports" and uses **Appeals to Authority** by citing various individuals and audio clips as definitive proof. The entire argument is framed as a **Black & White Fallacy** where the only alternative to the official story is a massive conspiracy, culminating in an **Appeal to Fear** with the introduction of a "deep state false flag operation," a phrase that also functions as a **Thought-terminating cliché**. The sheer density of these manipulative techniques indicates a clear intent to guide the reader to a predetermined conclusion rather than to present facts for neutral consideration.
