1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Keith Ellison with multiple insulting labels, including "Hakim Muhammad" (used pejoratively), "pathological liar," "accused woman abuser," "totalitarian-minded individual," and "flea-infested political con man."

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated verbatim three times in a row.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the cliché "If you like down with dogs, you're going to get fleas" as a brief, memorable phrase to summarize its argument against Ellison.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by linking Ellison to Farrakhan, who it claims "has called on 10,000 blacks to stalk and murder white people." It also uses the poll about the "caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border" to evoke fear about immigration.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is designed to cast doubt on Keith Ellison's credibility. Direct examples include "Yeah, right, Hakim!" and "Keith, you're lying," which directly question his statements.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by labeling Ellison a "totalitarian-minded individual" and a "flea-infested political con man." It also minimizes Ellison's denunciation of Farrakhan by immediately dismissing it as a lie.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national identity by introducing a poll about using the "U.S. military" to stop migrants at the "U.S. border," and by referencing the "God damn, America!" controversy.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged language, such as "pathological liar," "stalk and murder," "devil as their father," and "flea-infested political con man," all designed to evoke strong negative emotions.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of Ellison by associating him with groups hated by the target audience, stating he "has been supported by Communists and Islamists alike."

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular or that "everyone" believes it.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue by stating that both Ellison and Farrakhan "have the same devil as their father because both men are following after the teaching of the Koran."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague or obscure; its attacks and accusations are very direct and clear.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses a tweet from "Michael Ahrens of GOP.com" as evidence to support its claims, presenting him as a credible authority on the matter.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents only two extreme options for dealing with the migrant caravan: "Yes, military force should be used" or "No, keep the military out of it," ignoring all other possible solutions.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase, "As the old saying goes, 'If you like down with dogs, you're going to get fleas,'" to shut down nuanced discussion and present its conclusion as an undeniable truth.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the poll about the migrant caravan, an issue unrelated to Keith Ellison's ties to Louis Farrakhan, to distract the reader and stir up unrelated emotions.

17. Straw men – No – The text does not refute an argument that Ellison did not make. Instead, it directly attacks the argument he *did* make (that he has distanced himself) by calling it a lie and presenting contrary evidence.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects from the specifics of the Ellison case to charge a political opponent with hypocrisy by saying, "Maybe Ellison is attempting to pull an Obama. Remember when Obama's 'pastor,' Jeremiah Wright uttered 'God damn, America!'?... Ellison is attempting to do that same."

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the audience to adopt an extremely negative view of Keith Ellison by employing a massive arsenal of propaganda techniques. The article systematically uses name-calling, loaded language, and appeals to fear to create an emotional, rather than rational, response in the reader. It relies heavily on logical fallacies such as whataboutism, causal oversimplification, the black & white fallacy, and red herrings (the migrant poll) to distract from and distort the issue. The use of a thought-terminating cliché and an appeal to a partisan authority further serves to shut down critical thinking. The sheer volume and intensity of these techniques, present in nearly every paragraph, confirm that the text is constructed not as a factual report, but as a deliberate effort to manipulate audience perception and demonize a political figure.
