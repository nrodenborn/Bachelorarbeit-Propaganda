### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "disastrous nuclear deal" (attacks the Iran deal with a negative label).  
2. **Repetition** – **No** – No significant repetition of phrases for emphasis.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., no chants or rallying cries).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Compares Iran to North Korea, implying Iran will become a nuclear threat if the deal stands: "It bought time to turn into a full-fledged nuclear power under our noses."  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Repeatedly questions Obama/Kerry’s credibility: "This turned out to be a lie," "the Obama administration lied to the American people."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Minimizes Trump’s actions ("all that President Trump has done... is return the JCPOA to Congress") while exaggerating failures ("disastrous nuclear deal," "caved to Iranian pressure").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to U.S. security/constitutional integrity: "Had Obama followed the Constitution," "lying to the American people."  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotionally charged terms: "shamelessly denied," "gall," "caved," "disastrous," "kicked the can down the road."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Compares appeasing Iran to the Munich Pact with Hitler: "as proven by the infamous Munich Pact... with Adolf Hitler."  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone supports this").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames Obama/Kerry for future Iranian nukes: "Clinton started us down the primrose path... now [North Korea] is on the verge of striking the U.S. mainland."  
12. **Obfuscation** – **No** – Arguments are direct, not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Uses Russian Ambassador Churkin to dismiss missile concerns: "legally you cannot violate a call."  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents JCPOA as all failure vs. Trump’s fixes: Either fix flaws or let Iran become nuclear-armed.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Intimidation works" (shuts down scrutiny of IAEA).  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – North Korea comparison is relevant to the argument.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Accurately represents opponents’ claims (e.g., Kerry’s "sunset" denial).  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No charging opponents with hypocrisy unrelated to the issue.

### Verdict – 90% –  
**Explanation**: The text is highly likely propaganda due to:  
1. **Systematic use of manipulative techniques**: Loaded language, name-calling, fear appeals, and Hitler analogies dominate. These distort facts to vilify opponents (Obama/Kerry) and glorify Trump’s actions.  
2. **One-sided narrative**: Omits counterarguments (e.g., international support for JCPOA) while cherry-picking examples to paint the deal as a failure.  
3. **Emotional manipulation**: Uses charged terms ("lied," "caved," "disastrous") to provoke anger/disgust, overriding objective analysis.  
4. **False equivalences**: Compares Iran negotiations to North Korea/Munich Pact despite contextual differences, exploiting historical trauma.  
5. **Purpose**: Clearly aims to delegitimize critics, justify Trump’s policy shift, and rally readers against the JCPOA—aligning with political propaganda goals.  
While factual elements exist (e.g., missile test quotes), their framing serves persuasion over balanced discourse. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges minor factual reporting (e.g., IAEA statements), but the overwhelming tone and technique usage confirm propaganda.
