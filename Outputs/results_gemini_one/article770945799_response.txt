Name calling – Yes – The text reports Saucier’s allegation that Hillary Clinton was involved in “corruption and criminal activity,” which labels her as a criminal.

Repetition – Yes – The central idea of a “double standard” or “unequal protection” is repeated throughout the text using different phrasing. Examples include: “unequal protection of the law,” “let Hillary off the hook... while Kristian Saucier served hard time,” “unfair” and “unequal,” and “a double standard that let Clinton get off scot-free.”

Slogans – No – While phrases like “double standard” are repeated, they function as a description of the core argument rather than a brief, memorable rallying cry intended for mass adoption.

Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses on an alleged past injustice and does not attempt to instill fear about a future event or alternative idea.

Doubt – Yes – The entire premise of the lawsuit as reported is to question the credibility and fairness of the Obama administration officials. The text states the lawsuit alleges Saucier was subject to “unequal protection of the law and cites Comey and Obama’s willingness to not prosecute Hillary Clinton.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text reports Saucier’s framing of his crime as a “minor military infraction” while simultaneously describing Clinton’s alleged actions as “more serious violations of the same law.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text quotes Saucier appealing directly to patriotism and American identity: “The U.S. Constitution clearly states that all citizens are born with inalienable rights... a violation of the rights of all Americans to have equal protection under the law.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the reader’s perception. Examples include “scapegoated,” “served hard time,” “corruption and criminal activity,” “get off scot-free,” and “lashed out.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that the idea is popular or that the reader should agree with it because many others do. It focuses on the claims of one individual.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents Saucier’s claim that his prosecution had a simple cause: it was “politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton’s emails,” which ignores the complex legal and procedural reasons for a federal prosecution.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The language in the article is direct and clear in presenting Saucier’s claims and the details of his lawsuit.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The pardon by President Trump is presented as an authoritative validation of Saucier’s case, giving his lawsuit more weight. Saucier is quoted saying, “I could have just taken the pardon by President Trump and gone on with my life,” which frames the pardon as a form of vindication.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The article frames the situation as a simple binary choice: the harsh prosecution of Saucier for a “minor” infraction versus the complete lack of prosecution for Clinton for “more serious” violations. This creates a stark contrast that ignores any potential nuances or legal differences between the two cases.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés intended to shut down debate or critical thought.

Red herring – Yes – The article introduces the issue of Saucier’s lawyer being barred from practicing, which prompts Saucier to “accuse New York officials of trying to hinder his court fight.” This distracts from the central claims of the lawsuit against federal officials and introduces a new, potentially unrelated narrative of a wider conspiracy.

Straw men – No – The article primarily presents one side of an argument and does not set up and refute a counter-argument that was not actually made.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text is a clear example of whataboutism. The core of Saucier’s argument is not about his own guilt or innocence but about the alleged hypocrisy of the justice system: he was prosecuted, but “what about” Hillary Clinton?

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. Although it is structured as a news report on a lawsuit, it functions as a propaganda piece by exclusively and uncritically presenting one side of a politically charged story. The article heavily employs a wide range of propaganda techniques to frame the narrative. The central argument is built on **Whataboutism** and a **Black & White Fallacy**, creating a simplistic story of a victim versus a corrupt establishment. This narrative is amplified through the use of **Loaded Language** (“scapegoated,” “get off scot-free”), **Exaggeration/Minimization** (his “minor infraction” vs. her “serious violations”), and **Repetition** of the “double standard” theme. It casts **Doubt** on the integrity of former top officials and appeals to patriotism through **Flag-Waving** by invoking the Constitution. The lack of any opposing viewpoint, context, or critical analysis of Saucier’s claims, combined with the sheer number of techniques used, moves the text from objective reporting into the realm of persuasion and political messaging.
