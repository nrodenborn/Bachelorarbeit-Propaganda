Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "neocon warhawks", "swamp" (referring to foreign policy establishment), "fake news".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Gulf of Tonkin incident" is repeated numerous times; The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated verbatim three times.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases designed for mass appeal are used as slogans in the text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text repeatedly warns that a fabricated "Gulf of Tonkin incident" (a false flag) will be used to "drag us into" a catastrophic war with Iran, invoking the horrific consequences of the Vietnam War ("deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The text explicitly casts doubt on the historical Gulf of Tonkin incident ("it wasn't true... fictitious creation"), the current narrative around Iran ("neocons’ claims that Iran is the 'greatest threat'"), and mainstream media reporting ("dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity... couldn’t be disputed", "reluctance to question official pronouncements").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes (Potential)** – Describing the Vietnam War deaths as "millions of Vietnamese" is likely accurate overall, but the phrasing ("millions") combined with "tens of thousands of U.S. troops" minimizes the relative scale of US losses compared to Vietnamese losses. The characterization of US actions leaving "horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias" in multiple countries could be seen as a broad, somewhat exaggerated summation, though rooted in reality.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its argument. It critiques US actions and policies.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Numerous emotionally charged words/phrases: "de facto government employee", "flagrant lies", "fictitious creation", "fomenting", "tarnishing", "egregiously erred", "swamp", "ensnare", "mess", "sabotage", "violent overthrow", "outright insane", "horrific death tolls", "war-ravaged dystopias", "take out".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text does not argue that an idea should be accepted because it's popular. It focuses on criticizing established narratives and actions.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – "If due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did." This oversimplifies the complex political, social, and military factors sustaining the Vietnam War, suggesting media doubt alone could have significantly altered its course/duration.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is generally direct and clear in its accusations and historical recounting, even if biased.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Colonel Douglas Macgregor, Seymour Hersh, Tom Wells (author), General Wesley Clark, and the released transcripts to lend credibility to its claims about the Tonkin incident, MEK training, and the alleged plan to overthrow Iran.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – "the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran is outright insane." This presents US intervention as having *only* negative consequences (like Syria, Iraq, etc.), ignoring any potential nuance or alternative perspectives on outcomes. Also implied: Media either does "due diligence" or acts as a "de facto government employee".
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" or "that's just common sense" are used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on its main arguments: historical media/government deception (Tonkin), current push for war with Iran via false flag, and the negative consequences of intervention. The Kavanaugh poll is arguably a red herring/distraction, but it's presented as a poll solicitation, not an argumentative distraction within the main narrative.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text critiques actual positions (e.g., neocons labeling Iran the "greatest threat", official justifications for Tonkin) rather than misrepresenting them.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not charge its opponents (neocons, government, media) with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated contradictions in their past behavior. It critiques their specific actions regarding Tonkin, Iran, and MEK.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits a very high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is to persuade the reader that a) the government/media lied about the Gulf of Tonkin to start the Vietnam War, b) the same entities are currently lying to manufacture consent for a war with Iran using a similar false flag, and c) such wars are always disastrous. To achieve this, it heavily employs **Loaded Language**, **Appeal to Fear** (catastrophic war), **Doubt** (cast on official narratives/media), **Name Calling** ("warhawks", "swamp"), **Causal Oversimplification** (blaming media for Vietnam War longevity), **Black & White Fallacy** (intervention always bad), and **Appeal to Authority** (selective experts). While it presents verifiable facts (Tonkin was misrepresented, MEK was trained/delisted, Clark's memo), these facts are framed, selected, and amplified using manipulative techniques to promote a specific, alarmist, and highly critical view of US foreign policy and the media, leaving little room for nuance or counter-argument. The repetitive invocation of "Gulf of Tonkin" and inclusion of an unrelated poll further serve the persuasive aim. The overwhelming use of these techniques strongly indicates propaganda.
