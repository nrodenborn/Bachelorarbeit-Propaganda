1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the administration's action a “foolhardy move” and describes Cody Wilson as an “avowed anarchist” to frame him negatively.
2. Repetition – Yes – The core idea that these guns are dangerously and easily accessible is repeated in different ways, such as “carnage a click away,” “easy way to get around the law,” and “getting an AR-15-style rifle is just a matter of a few computer clicks.”
3. Slogans – Yes – The headline “3-D-printed guns put carnage a click away” serves as a brief and memorable phrase. The term “ghost guns” is also used as a catchy and evocative label.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by warning that guns will be available to “felons, those with mental illness, domestic abusers or possible terrorists” and that releasing the plans “will lead directly to the loss of more innocent lives.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the administration's motives and competence by calling the decision “inexplicable” and “senseless,” and noting that a Freedom of Information Act request was filed “to find out how this senseless decision was reached.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the ease of creating a functional weapon with phrases like “carnage a click away” and “just a matter of a few computer clicks,” which simplifies a complex technical process.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use appeals to patriotism or national identity to persuade the audience.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases such as “carnage,” “dangerous scenario,” “worship at the altar of gun rights,” and “senseless decision.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare the idea or its proponents to groups hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text creates an impression of consensus by stating the plans have “rightly alarmed leading gun safety groups and law enforcement officials,” and then lists multiple organizations to reinforce this idea.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex outcome by stating that releasing the instructions “will lead directly to the loss of more innocent lives.” It also attributes the administration's legal settlement to a single cause: its “worship at the altar of gun rights.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its argument and does not use intentionally vague expressions to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the authority of “leading gun safety groups,” “law enforcement officials,” and Senator Robert Menendez to lend weight to its argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the issue as a choice between two extremes: blocking the blueprints to ensure public safety or allowing their release, which will inevitably result in “the loss of more innocent lives,” ignoring any potential nuances or alternative solutions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like “senseless decision” and “foolhardy move” are used to dismiss the opposing viewpoint without engaging its substance. The statement “That’s not enough” is used to shut down further consideration of a stated promise.
16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on the issue of 3D-printed guns and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – No – The text primarily ignores the opposition's arguments rather than misrepresenting them to easily refute them.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a strong example of propaganda. While it is likely an opinion editorial, which is expected to be persuasive, it relies overwhelmingly on propaganda techniques rather than reasoned argumentation. The article’s primary method of persuasion is a powerful and sustained appeal to fear, supported by heavily loaded language (“carnage,” “dangerous,” “senseless”) and exaggeration (“carnage a click away”). It employs a black & white fallacy, presenting the situation as a simple choice between safety and certain death. The piece selectively uses appeals to authority and a bandwagon effect to create a sense of consensus, while simultaneously using name-calling and doubt to discredit the opposition without engaging their arguments in good faith. The combination of these techniques creates a one-sided narrative designed to provoke a strong emotional reaction and steer the reader to a predetermined conclusion, rather than to inform or foster critical thought.
