1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to an opponent as a “Modernist apostate priest” and implies Pope Francis is a “destroyer.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the word “apocryphal,” often in quotation marks, to mock the position of its opponents and reinforce the idea that they dismiss valid prophecies.

3. Slogans – No – The text uses longer arguments and quotations rather than brief, memorable phrases to make its case.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses prophecies that describe a terrifying future for the Church, such as a time of “great trials and afflictions,” when a “destroyer” will “draw many into error and death,” to create fear about the current state of the Church.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built around casting doubt on the credibility of “neo-Catholic commentators,” suggesting their research is lazy (“a few Google searches”) and their motives are suspect (“He simply wished that it was so”).

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the arguments of opponents by calling them “nit-picking” and exaggerates the certainty of its own conclusion with the phrase “That question answers itself.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific Catholic identity by framing the conflict as one between faithful “Traditionalists” and a corrupt hierarchy, stating that the faithful will “suffer injuries and persecutions as rebels and schismatics.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like “pestilent men,” “cunning,” “malice of the wicked,” and “papolatry” to frame the argument and evoke an emotional response.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text discredits the arguments of Emile Poulet by associating him with groups the intended audience would find hateful: he is a “Modernist apostate priest” who belonged to the “worker-priest” movement, which was “condemned” by Pope Pius XII.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to popularity. Instead, it argues from the position of a righteous and persecuted minority, which is the opposite of the bandwagon technique.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause (a prophesied “destroyer” Pope) for what it terms the “current ecclesial crisis,” which is a complex historical and theological phenomenon.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author attempts to appear precise and well-researched by providing specific citations and sources, rather than using intentionally vague language.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The entire argument is built on the authority of prophecies attributed to Saint Francis, Pope Pius XII, and Saint Robert Bellarmine, who are presented as unimpeachable sources.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either one accepts the author’s interpretation of these prophecies, or one is a lazy and deceitful “neo-Catholic.” It leaves no room for nuance or alternative interpretations.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text ends with the phrase “That question answers itself,” which is used to shut down critical thought by asserting the conclusion is obvious and requires no further discussion.

16. Red herring – Yes – The author introduces the irrelevant personal anecdote about not being thanked by a “neo-Catholic luminary” to distract from the core argument and poison the well against the opposing side.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a caricature of its opponents’ views, such as the idea of “papolatry, which holds that the indefectibility of the Church depends upon defending every word and deed of a given Pope,” an extreme position that is easy to attack.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy; its attacks are more direct, focusing on character and belief rather than employing a “what about you” defense.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to foster understanding or engage in a balanced theological discussion, but to persuade the reader of a specific, highly controversial viewpoint by employing a vast arsenal of propaganda techniques. The text systematically uses appeals to fear and authority, loaded language, and name-calling to create a strong emotional response. It constructs a black-and-white worldview of faithful traditionalists versus deceitful modernists, using straw man arguments to misrepresent and easily dismiss opposing views. Critical thinking is discouraged through the use of thought-terminating clichés. While it presents sources, the framing and interpretation are entirely one-sided and designed to lead to a single, predetermined conclusion, making it a clear piece of persuasive propaganda rather than a genuine inquiry.
