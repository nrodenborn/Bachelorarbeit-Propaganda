### Propaganda Technique Analysis:  
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Muslim settlers" (derogatory label implying foreign occupation).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "shouting, ‘Allahu Akbar’" repeated in every attack example; "mental illness" repeated 5+ times.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Lists graphic attacks (beheading, stabbings) to instill fear of Muslim violence and imply systemic denial.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "It can’t be a case of Muslim Judeophobia. (That would be Islamophobic.)" mocks authorities’ refusal to label attacks as religiously motivated.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates frequency ("They’re all crazy in Europe"); minimizes mental illness as a factor ("standard excuse").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to national identity or patriotism.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Muslim terrorist," "beheaded," "nuts," "insane," "stabbed," "collaborates" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – "Long live Hitler, to death the Jews" and implicit comparison of authorities to Vichy collaborators.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "all authorities in Europe" blamed for uniformly using mental illness excuses.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes all attacks solely to Islam ("Getting really excited about Jews is a common problem among Muslim settlers"), ignoring other factors.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Language is direct, not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authoritative sources cited; instead, authorities are dismissed.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents only two options: attacks are due to Islamist extremism OR authorities are insane ("Maybe it’s not the terrorists who are nuts. Maybe it’s the authorities").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "They’re all crazy in Europe" ends discussion on societal/root causes.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Lists unrelated attacks in Germany, Russia, Amsterdam to distract from the initial Paris incident.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Portrays authorities as claiming attacks have "nothing to do with Islam" (oversimplifying their focus on mental health evaluations).  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – "And in Russia... And Amsterdam..." uses other attacks to deflect from addressing mental health nuances.

### Verdict  
**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 12 distinct propaganda techniques to advance a singular narrative: that European authorities systematically deny "Islamic terrorism" by falsely attributing attacks to mental illness. Key indicators include:  
- **Loaded language** ("Muslim terrorists," "nuts") and **name-calling** ("settlers") to dehumanize subjects.  
- **Repetition** of "Allahu Akbar" and "mental illness" to reinforce bias.  
- **Appeal to fear** via violent imagery (beheadings, stabbings).  
- **Causal oversimplification** and **black/white fallacies** to ignore socioeconomic, psychological, or geopolitical complexities.  
- **Red herrings** and **whataboutism** to amplify isolated incidents into a perceived epidemic.  
The tone is sarcastic ("It’s okay") and deliberately inflammatory, aiming to provoke anger toward Muslims and distrust of institutions rather than inform. While based on real events, selective framing, omission of counter-evidence (e.g., detailed psychiatric reports), and manipulative rhetoric confirm its propagandistic intent.
