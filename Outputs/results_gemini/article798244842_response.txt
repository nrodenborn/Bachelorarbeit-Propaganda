1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels political figures like Clinton, Obama, and Bush as “global elite puppets” and describes a group as a “ruthless power-seeking elite.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that a powerful elite (the “Deep State”) is censoring independent media to maintain control is repeated throughout the text in various forms.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the subheading “Trump is Not The Solution, We Are” as a memorable phrase to rally the reader, and also employs the cliché “Monkey see, monkey do” to simplify a complex social phenomenon.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that the actions of the “elite” are leading to an “Orwellian state type of existence” and quotes Senator William Jenner to evoke fear of a “total dictatorship” and a group determined to “destroy our Constitution.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively encourages readers to doubt established sources, stating that what comes from the mainstream is “highly suspect and questionable” and that we should not trust “authority figures with a tremendous amount of power, wealth, and conflicts of interests” to be fact-checkers.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the scale of the issue with phrases like “hundreds, if not thousands of Independent media pages” and the idea that “one massive conglomerate at the top” controls everything. It also minimizes the reasons for the initial page deletions by simply framing them as a pretext for a wider censorship campaign.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text opens with a lengthy quote from JFK appealing to the values of a “free and open society” and what “we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to.” It also uses a truncated reference to the Pledge of Allegiance: “With Liberty and Justi...”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like “repugnant,” “ruthless power-seeking elite,” “global elite puppets,” “cyber false flagging,” and “Orwellian state” to evoke strong negative feelings towards the opposition.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party to discredit an idea.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests a growing movement of awareness, stating that “More and more people see it this way” and that a “global mass is growing closer to a critical mass,” encouraging the reader to join the winning side.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes complex events, like the moderation of social media and the vilification of Donald Trump, to a single, simple cause: a coordinated effort by the “Deep State” or “global elite” to preserve their power.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text frequently refers to powerful, ill-defined groups like the “global elite,” the “Deep State,” and a “massive conglomerate at the top” without providing specific details, making the accusations difficult to scrutinize or disprove.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from respected or authoritative figures like JFK, Edward Snowden, and Einstein (“Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.”) to lend credibility to its arguments.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark choice: either you accept the narrative of the “independent media” and are part of the “awakening,” or you believe the “mainstream media” and are part of the problem, allowing the “Deep State” to have power. It dismisses the Democrat vs. Republican paradigm only to replace it with another binary: the elite vs. the people.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like “Monkey see, monkey do” to dismissively explain public opinion. It also uses quotes like “Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance” to preemptively shut down skepticism of its own claims.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces unrelated but emotionally charged topics like “elite pedophilia and ritual abuse” and the dangers of “cell phone towers” to distract from the central argument about media censorship and broaden the scope of the alleged conspiracy.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified version of the opposing argument, framing the reason for page deletions as a belief that “people cannot just say what they want on the internet.” This misrepresents the more complex reasons for content moderation, which often involve specific violations of terms of service like harassment or dangerous misinformation.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects criticism of Wikileaks by charging opponents with hypocrisy, stating, “Heck, the Clinton’s and John Podesta have even referenced Wikileaks before that became ‘fake.’”

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is an unambiguous example of propaganda. It utilizes 17 of the 18 listed techniques in a dense and layered fashion to promote a specific, conspiratorial worldview. Its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade and indoctrinate.

The entire article is built on a foundation of several key propaganda strategies. It establishes a stark **black & white fallacy** (the awakened people vs. the evil "Deep State") and uses **causal oversimplification** to attribute all negative events to this single, nefarious entity. This enemy is kept deliberately vague (**obfuscation**) through terms like "global elite" and "they," making the claims impossible to verify.

To build its case, the text heavily relies on **appeals to authority** (JFK, Snowden, Einstein) to borrow credibility, while simultaneously using **doubt** to erode any trust in established institutions (mainstream media, government, Facebook). It stokes **fear** by warning of an "Orwellian state" and a "total dictatorship." The narrative is peppered with **loaded language** ("ruthless," "puppets," "slandered") and **name-calling** to demonize the opposition. The author presents themselves as an insider fighting for the reader, encouraging them to join a growing movement (**bandwagon**) and see the "truth." The argument is designed to be emotionally compelling and to discourage critical analysis, making it a textbook case of modern propaganda.
