### Verdict – 40% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text **contains elements of propaganda** (slogans, loaded language, fear appeals, doubt) through emotionally charged phrasing (#ReleaseTheReport, "cover-up," "sneak preview") and implied distrust of institutional actors. However, it primarily reports factual events:  
- **Non-propaganda elements**: Neutral attribution (e.g., "AP reported"), direct quotes, bipartisan context (Giuliani/White House responses), and procedural details (e.g., DOJ policy).  
- **Propaganda elements**: Framing emphasizes urgency and suspicion, leveraging #ReleaseTheReport and "cover-up" rhetoric to persuade readers of DOJ obstruction.  

**Conclusion**: While the text serves advocacy goals (pressuring DOJ), it avoids overt deception or logical fallacies. Its persuasive tone is typical of partisan messaging but remains grounded in verifiable actions (e.g., committee demands, Giuliani’s statements). Thus, it is **more informational than propagandistic**, with propaganda techniques used moderately (40%) to frame the narrative.
