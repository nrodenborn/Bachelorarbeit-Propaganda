1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the accusation against Kavanaugh as a "smear" and refers to groups opposing him as "lefty groups." It also describes George Soros's organizations as "tentacles," an insulting and dehumanizing label.
2. Repetition – No – The text reinforces a central theme but does not repeat the same specific message or phrase over and over.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases that function as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text aims to create anger and suspicion, but it does not explicitly instill fear about a negative future or alternative.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire purpose of the text is to cast doubt on the credibility of the accuser by questioning the motives of her lawyer. The headline itself, "Kavanaugh Accuser's Lawyer is Vice Chair of Soros Funded Org Opposing Kavanaugh," is designed to make the reader doubt the legitimacy of the accusation.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses "tentacles" to describe the Open Society Foundation, an exaggeration meant to portray it as a monstrous, far-reaching entity. It also minimizes POGO's rebuttal by placing it in a small "UPDATE" at the very end.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text appeals to a political or partisan identity, not to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "smear," "obstruction tactic," "lefty groups," and "tentacles" to evoke a negative emotional response from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – While the text uses a disliked figure (George Soros) to discredit an idea, it does not invoke Hitler or Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not claim that its viewpoint is popular or that the reader should agree because many others do.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause (a political hit job funded by George Soros and Democrats) for a very complex event (a sexual assault allegation in the context of a Supreme Court nomination). It suggests the lawyer's political connections are the sole reason for the accusation, stating it was the "tactic of choice... before they fastened on to this latest smear."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is quite direct in its accusations and is not deliberately unclear.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses a tweet from Jacob Wohl as evidence for its claims about Debra Katz's political donations, presenting him as an authority on the information.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text implicitly frames the situation as having only two options: the accusation is either a genuine claim or it is a political "smear." By focusing entirely on the lawyer's political connections, it pushes the reader to accept the "smear" narrative and ignore the possibility of the claim's validity.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The sarcastic phrase "What a surprise!" is used to dismiss the information about the lawyer's political donations as obvious and not worthy of serious consideration, thereby discouraging critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The central issue is the truth of the sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh. The text distracts from this issue by introducing the lawyer's political affiliations and the funding sources of an organization she is involved with. This information is a red herring used to attack the accuser's credibility by proxy without addressing the substance of her claim.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent an opponent's argument in order to refute it. It focuses on attacking the character and motivations of the lawyer.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect from the issue by charging an opponent with hypocrisy on another matter.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary goal is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to dismiss a sexual assault allegation by discrediting the accuser's lawyer. It achieves this by employing a significant number of propaganda techniques.

The central strategy is a combination of **Red Herring** and **Doubt**. Instead of addressing the actual accusation, the text shifts the focus entirely to the lawyer's political connections, linking her to George Soros and the Democratic party—figures likely to be viewed negatively by the target audience. This is a classic propaganda tactic: if you cannot attack the message, attack the messenger (or in this case, the messenger's representative).

This is reinforced by **Loaded Language** ("smear," "tentacles," "lefty groups"), **Causal Oversimplification** (the accusation is solely a political tactic), and the **Black & White Fallacy** (it's either true or a political smear, and here's all the evidence for it being a smear). The piece is constructed to build a narrative of a coordinated political conspiracy, thereby invalidating the accusation without ever engaging with its facts. The lack of neutral language and the clear persuasive intent make it highly propagandistic.
