Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "left-wing media" (used pejoratively), "hysteria of the left".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrase is used repeatedly as a slogan for the core argument.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – While actions against Russia are framed as tough, no explicit fear of alternatives (like weakness) is instilled as the primary support.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "The constant hand-wringing... over President Trump’s loyalties and his connection with Russia is just silly."; "The media has been hanging on every word... arguing that his rhetoric is proof positive..."; "People are obsessed about words...". These cast doubt on the media's narrative and focus.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – **Minimization**: Downplaying Trump's controversial Helsinki press conference ("Not that he said things the way he should have... but I don’t quite know what people want."). **Exaggeration**: Portraying Obama's response as "weakness on a pathetic scale".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "force Putin to change his aggressive behavior"; "help them defend themselves"; "weaken Russia"; "The stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has." Appeals to national security, strength, and defending allies against an aggressor.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "hand-wringing", "silly", "proof positive", "mole", "nastiness", "hysteria", "firm", "intellectually honest". These words carry strong emotional connotations (dismissiveness, accusation, negativity, praise).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – While citing authorities (Hemingway, Gingrich), the argument isn't primarily based on the *popularity* of the idea that Trump is tough on Russia.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The argument lists specific actions as evidence of toughness, not a single simple cause for complex events.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is relatively direct in listing actions and criticizing opponents.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Heavily relies on quotes and arguments from Mollie Hemingway (The Federalist) and Newt Gingrich (Former Speaker) to support the claim that Trump is tough on Russia.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as either Trump being a "Russian mole" (implied false) OR Trump being "firm"/"tough" on Russia (presented as true). Ignores nuances or middle ground positions.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Any intellectually honest review..." is used to dismiss opposing viewpoints and imply that only those agreeing with the author's conclusion are intellectually honest.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The repeated Kavanaugh poll is completely irrelevant to the topic of Trump's actions towards Russia and serves as a distraction.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Portrays critics as *only* focused on Trump's words ("People are obsessed about words") and ignoring his actions, and as claiming he is a "Russian mole" based *only* on rhetoric. This misrepresents the broader concerns critics had (e.g., about private meetings, undermining US intelligence, potential leverage).
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Deflects criticism of Trump by pointing to perceived failures of others: "First, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump... are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016." (Brennan, Clapper). Also, constantly contrasting Trump's actions with Obama's ("far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being") serves to deflect criticism by highlighting another's perceived weakness.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is to vehemently defend Trump against accusations of being soft on Russia and attack his critics (media, intelligence officials, Obama). It achieves this through **Name Calling** ("left-wing media", "hysteria"), **Loaded Language** ("silly", "pathetic scale", "nastiness"), **Doubt** (casting the media narrative as unfounded), **Appeal to Authority** (Hemingway, Gingrich), **Black & White Fallacy** (mole vs. tough), **Straw Men** (misrepresenting critics' arguments), **Whataboutism** (deflecting to Obama/Brennan/Clapper), **Thought-Terminating Clichés** ("intellectually honest review"), and **Red Herring** (Kavanaugh poll). While it presents factual actions (sanctions, weapon sales, expulsions), these are framed within a highly partisan, emotionally charged, and opposition-attacking narrative designed to persuade rather than provide a balanced analysis. The minimization of Trump's missteps and exaggeration of Obama's weakness further indicate a propagandistic intent. The sheer number and nature of techniques used strongly indicate propaganda.
