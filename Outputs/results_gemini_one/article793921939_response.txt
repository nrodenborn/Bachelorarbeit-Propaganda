1. Name calling – Yes – Explanation: The text uses insulting labels to attack Dina Powell and her associates. For example, it refers to her as a “‘globalist’”, part of the “swamp”, and a “Deep State operative”. It also labels H.R. McMaster an “Islamic apologist”.

2. Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The text repeats the poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" three times in a row. It also repeatedly mentions Powell’s connections to figures like Huma Abedin and Valerie Jarrett to reinforce a negative association.

3. Slogans – Yes – Explanation: The text uses the slogan “America first” to frame its argument, suggesting Powell is not aligned with this approach. It also uses the phrase “drain the swamp” as a slogan.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation: The text suggests that appointing Powell would be a continuation of a “failed approach” to foreign policy, implying negative consequences for the country. Example: "Her top role at the NSC represents McMaster’s vision for our approach to Islam. And it’s an echo of the failed approach of the Bush years."

5. Doubt – Yes – Explanation: The text casts doubt on the wisdom of appointing Powell by asking rhetorical questions that question the administration's judgment. Example: "how do you fight the Deep State by putting Deep State operatives in these positions? How do you drain the swamp by adding to it?"

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: The text exaggerates the nature of Powell's connections to create a more sinister impression. Example: "The media dubbed her the Republican Huma Abedin." This is an exaggerated comparison used to create a strong negative association.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation: The text appeals to patriotism by framing the argument around what is good for the country and its citizens. Example: "it's being reported that Powell is 'not interested' in the post, which is a good thing for Americans."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the reader's opinion. Examples include calling Goldman Sachs' history "sordid" and referring to the "controversial Clinton Foundation" and the "willfully ignorant McMaster crowd".

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation: The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis to discredit an idea or person.

10. Bandwagon – No – Explanation: The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular. It cites "some conservatives on social media" but does not claim this is a majority view that should be followed.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: The text simplifies complex political situations into a single cause. For example, it suggests H.R. McMaster's entire policy was based on one "failed view" of Islam and that Powell's appointment would be a simple continuation of that. Example: "McMaster subscribed to the Obama view that Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam...McMaster forced out superb K.T. McFarland...and inserted Dina Habib-Powell".

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanation: The text is not intentionally vague; its purpose is to be direct in its accusations and persuade the reader of a specific viewpoint, not to confuse them with unclear language.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation: The text cites Pamela Geller and Daniel Greenfield, presenting them as authorities whose opinions should be accepted as evidence against Powell. Example: "Pamela Geller also pointed out why Powell should not be the UN ambassador."

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation: The text presents the situation as having only two outcomes: either you are for "draining the swamp" or you are "adding to it" by appointing someone like Powell, ignoring any middle ground or nuance. Example: "How do you drain the swamp by adding to it? The answer is clear: You don't."

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation: The text uses phrases like "drain the swamp" and "Deep State" which are used to shut down critical thought and frame the issue in simplistic, good-versus-evil terms. Example: "She is part of the swamp, part of the willfully ignorant McMaster crowd that clearly opposed Trump’s agenda."

16. Red herring – Yes – Explanation: The text introduces an irrelevant topic to distract from the main subject. The article is about Powell's potential nomination, but the final paragraph pivots to arguing that the US should leave the UN entirely. Example: "This would actually be the perfect time for Trump not to appoint an ambassador to the UN and call for the US to exit the anti-American organization..."

17. Straw men – No – Explanation: The text does not misrepresent an opponent's argument in order to refute it. It makes a direct attack on Dina Powell rather than refuting a specific argument made in her favor.

18. Whataboutism – No – Explanation: The text does not attempt to deflect criticism of one person by accusing another of hypocrisy. Its focus remains on attacking Dina Powell and her associates.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its purpose is not to provide a balanced or objective report on Dina Habib Powell's potential nomination, but to persuade the audience to adopt a negative view of her. It achieves this by employing a multitude of propaganda techniques. The core of the article is an attack built on name-calling ("globalist," "swamp"), loaded language ("sordid history"), and guilt by association, where Powell's connections to the Clintons, Goldman Sachs, and others are presented as definitive proof of her unsuitability. It uses appeals to authority (Geller, Greenfield), flag-waving ("good for Americans"), and a black & white fallacy (draining the swamp vs. adding to it) to reinforce its message. The piece selectively presents information and uses rhetorical questions and thought-terminating clichés to discourage critical analysis and guide the reader to a pre-determined conclusion. The inclusion of a red herring at the end further demonstrates that the author's goal is to push a broader political agenda rather than engage in a factual discussion of the specific topic.
