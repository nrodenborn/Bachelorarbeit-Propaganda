Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation*: No insulting labels are directly applied to individuals or groups. Terms like "Main Stream Media" carry a dismissive tone but aren't explicit insults per the definition.  

2. **Repetition** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: The concept of native-born workers "losing ground" is repeated (e.g., "native-born workers have lost ground to immigrants," "non-Hispanics have lost jobs").  

3. **Slogans** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: "VDAWDI" (VDARE's American Worker Displacement Index) is branded and repeated as a memorable phrase encapsulating their argument.  

4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: Instills fear with phrases like "Time is running out for native-born workers—a.k.a. Americans," framing immigration as an existential threat to native-born employment.  

5. **Doubt** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: Questions data credibility with "one of those mysterious memos has gone out to the Main Stream Media," implying media collusion to hide the "immigration moratorium solution."  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: Exaggerates Hispanic job growth as "whopping 24.2%" while minimizing broader economic context (e.g., ignoring recessions/policy impacts). Minimizes "atypical statistical noise" in May data while emphasizing trends supporting their narrative.  

7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: Equates "native-born workers" with "Americans" to appeal to national identity (e.g., "Time is running out for native-born workers—a.k.a. Americans").  

8. **Loaded Language** – Yes  
   *Explanation*: Uses emotionally charged terms like "displacement," "bleaker," "double-dip recession," and "panic" to evoke alarm and resentment.  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *Explanation*: No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  

10. **Bandwagon** – No  
    *Explanation*: Does not appeal to the popularity of the idea; instead frames it as overlooked or suppressed.  

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes  
    *Explanation*: Attributes native-born job losses primarily to immigration (e.g., "Hispanic/non-Hispanic divide was a convenient proxy for foreign-born workers displacing native-born counterparts"), ignoring complex economic factors.  

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes  
    *Explanation*: Uses vague, conspiratorial phrasing like "one of those mysterious memos has gone out" without evidence, creating confusion about media/government actions.  

13. **Appeal to authority** – No  
    *Explanation*: Cites BLS data but does not invoke an authoritative figure or institution to endorse their interpretation.  

14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes  
    *Explanation*: Presents employment as a zero-sum conflict between immigrants and natives (e.g., "ADVANTAGE NATIVE-BORN" vs. "ADVANTAGE IMMIGRANTS"), ignoring overlapping or synergistic economic roles.  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes  
    *Explanation*: Uses phrases like "Simply put, the 21st century has not been good for non-Hispanic job seekers" to oversimplify and halt deeper analysis of causes.  

16. **Red herring** – No  
    *Explanation*: No irrelevant distractions; the text stays focused on employment/immigration data.  

17. **Straw men** – No  
    *Explanation*: Does not refute a misrepresented argument; critiques data interpretations but not a fabricated opponent stance.  

18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    *Explanation*: Does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy; focuses on data trends.  

---

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It selectively uses BLS data to advance a nativist narrative, framing immigration as the primary cause of native-born job losses while ignoring systemic economic factors (e.g., recessions, automation). Techniques like **appeal to fear**, **loaded language**, and **causal oversimplification** dominate, portraying immigrants as threats to "Americans." The creation of "VDAWDI" (**slogans**) and emphasis on ethnic/nativity divides (**flag-waving**) further signal ideological framing. While it cites factual data, the interpretation is skewed to support a predetermined conclusion ("displacement"), with **obfuscation** and **doubt** used to discredit mainstream sources. The closing rhetorical question linking native-born struggles to the "Obama Administration" ties the economic argument to a political agenda, confirming its propagandistic intent.
