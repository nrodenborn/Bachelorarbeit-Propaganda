### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:  
1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation*: No insulting labels are applied to subjects (e.g., Saudi rulers are described neutrally as "autocratic leadership," a factual descriptor).  
2. **Repetition** – No  
   *Explanation*: Key terms (e.g., "Khashoggi," "investigation") are repeated for clarity, but not manipulatively.  
3. **Slogans** – No  
   *Explanation*: No brief, memorable phrases are used to oversimplify the issue (e.g., "thorough, transparent, and timely investigation" is a policy demand, not a slogan).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
   *Explanation*: The text describes diplomatic tensions but does not exploit fear to sway opinion (e.g., Turkish media reports are cited factually).  
5. **Doubt** – No  
   *Explanation*: Saudi denials are reported, but the text does not frame them to manipulatively seed doubt (e.g., "Saudi officials insisted... but provided no evidence" is neutral reporting).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No  
   *Explanation*: Graphic details (e.g., "dismembered") are attributed to Turkish media, not exaggerated by the author. Trump’s "rogue killers" theory is presented as his stance.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No  
   *Explanation*: Mentions of U.S.-Saudi alliances are contextual (e.g., Prince Mohammed calling them "important allies"), not used to stoke patriotism.  
8. **Loaded Language** – No  
   *Explanation*: Language is neutral (e.g., "diplomatic crisis," "growing furor") and avoids emotionally charged stereotypes.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *Explanation*: No comparisons to universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No  
    *Explanation*: Popular opinions (e.g., Congressional demands) are reported without urging readers to join a movement.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No  
    *Explanation*: The crisis is framed as complex (e.g., ties "frayed" due to multiple factors like oil and Iran policy), not oversimplified.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No  
    *Explanation*: Language is precise (e.g., "15-member Saudi military team," "bone saw"); no deliberate vagueness.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No  
    *Explanation*: Quotes from officials (e.g., Pompeo, Trump) are attributed, not used as unquestionable evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No  
    *Explanation*: Multiple perspectives are shown (e.g., U.S., Saudi, critics), avoiding false dichotomies.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No  
    *Explanation*: No phrases that shut down debate (e.g., "direct and candid" describes talks neutrally).  
16. **Red herring** – No  
    *Explanation*: All details (e.g., arms deals, regional goals) are relevant to the crisis; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No  
    *Explanation*: Criticisms (e.g., of Trump’s "rogue killers" remark) are fairly represented.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    *Explanation*: No accusations of hypocrisy to deflect blame (e.g., Saudi denials are reported without counter-accusations).

### Verdict – 5%  
**Explanation**: The text is a factual news report from the *Los Angeles Times*, not propaganda. It neutrally recounts events surrounding Pompeo’s visit to Saudi Arabia, citing multiple sources (U.S. officials, Saudi statements, Turkish media, critics) and avoiding manipulative techniques. Sensational details (e.g., Khashoggi’s alleged dismemberment) are attributed to specific reports, and the tone remains objective. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges potential subtle biases inherent in any reporting (e.g., using "autocratic" for Saudi leadership), but these do not dominate the narrative. The article’s focus on evidence gaps (e.g., Saudi lack of video proof), bipartisan reactions, and geopolitical complexities aligns with journalistic standards, not propagandistic intent.
