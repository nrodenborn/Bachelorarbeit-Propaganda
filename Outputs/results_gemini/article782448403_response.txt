Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief and memorable phrase as a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The article quotes Xavier Becerra's statement which claims that distributing the blueprints “needlessly endangered our children, our loved ones and our men and women in law enforcement.”

Doubt – Yes – The commentary by -BL explicitly questions the credibility of the news article by calling it “fake news” and of Xavier Becerra by stating he is “lying.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The commentary by -BL exaggerates Becerra’s position by calling him a “radical leftist gun grabbing anti-liberty” figure. It also minimizes the government's legal position by stating it was “a case the government was about to lose” as if it were a certainty.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The commentary by -BL appeals to a sense of American identity and patriotism by framing the issue around the “1st Amendment” and labeling an opponent as “anti-liberty.”

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The commentary by -BL presents the issue as a choice between absolute liberty (supporting the blueprints) and being a “radical leftist gun grabbing anti-liberty” opponent, ignoring any potential for a nuanced middle ground.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “preposterous left-wing political argle-bargle” is used by -BL to dismiss Becerra’s statement without engaging in substantive debate, effectively discouraging critical thought about his point.

Red herring – No – The commentary directly engages with the topic of the article and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract.

Whataboutism – No – The text attacks an opponent but does not counter a criticism by accusing the opponent of a similar wrongdoing.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. It is a composite piece, combining a factual news report with a highly biased commentary that reframes the entire text. The commentary, signed by -BL, begins by immediately priming the reader to distrust the article by labeling it "fake news." It then employs a multitude of propaganda techniques to attack the individuals and ideas it opposes. These include aggressive Name Calling (“radical leftist gun grabbing anti-liberty”), Loaded Language (“preposterous left-wing political argle-bargle”), and casting Doubt (“is lying”). It presents a Black & White Fallacy by framing the issue as a simple battle between liberty and its enemies. The purpose is not to inform or foster understanding of a complex legal issue, but to discredit an opponent, reinforce an ideological viewpoint, and persuade the reader to dismiss the original news report entirely. The news article itself is largely neutral, but its inclusion serves as a vehicle for the propagandistic commentary that surrounds it.
