Verdict – 40% – The text contains elements of propaganda, including doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, and appeal to authority. These techniques are used to question the credibility of the coroner's office and the handling of the autopsy report, as well as to evoke an emotional response from the audience. However, the text does not heavily rely on multiple propaganda techniques, and it also includes factual information and quotes from credible sources, which reduces the overall likelihood of it being pure propaganda.
