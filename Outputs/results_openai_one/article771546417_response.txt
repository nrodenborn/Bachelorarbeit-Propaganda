Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as name calling, slogans, exaggeration/minimization, flag-waving, loaded language, and appeal to authority. These elements suggest a moderate likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it appears to be designed to elicit an emotional response and support for a particular viewpoint, particularly in favor of Donald Trump and his supporters. However, the absence of other techniques like repetition, appeal to fear, and whataboutism suggests that it is not heavily propagandistic.
