### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text exhibits **multiple hallmarks of propaganda**, primarily through:  
- **Emotional manipulation** (loaded language, victimization of Saucier).  
- **False equivalences** (Saucier’s submarine photos vs. Clinton’s email server).  
- **Oversimplification** (attributing Saucier’s prosecution solely to political bias from the Clinton scandal).  
- **Repetition** and **whataboutism** to reinforce perceived injustice.  
- **Black-and-white framing** that ignores legal nuances (e.g., differences in intent, scale, or confidentiality levels between cases).  

While based on real events (Saucier’s pardon, Clinton’s email investigation), the text selectively omits key context:  
- Saucier **pleaded guilty** to destroying evidence; Clinton was not charged after an FBI investigation.  
- Military vs. civilian legal procedures are conflated.  

The narrative’s goal is to delegitimize Obama-era officials and imply systemic corruption, using Saucier’s story as a political weapon. Fox News’ editorial slant amplifies this framing. The lack of counter-evidence or neutral analysis further signals propagandistic intent. However, the 15% uncertainty reflects that core facts (the lawsuit, pardon, and Clinton comparison) are not fabricated—only skewed.
