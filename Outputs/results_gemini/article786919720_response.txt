Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text uses the phrase "Desperate Feinstein" in its headline to attack Senator Feinstein with an insulting label.

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – Yes – The phrase "but this is the Democrats for you" is used as a brief, dismissive slogan to characterize an entire political party's behavior.

Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to support its ideas by instilling fear in the audience about alternative viewpoints or outcomes.

Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the credibility of Senator Feinstein's motives and the allegation itself, calling it "ridiculous," a "last minute gambit," and quoting a sarcastic tweet about a "secret letter regarding a secret matter."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the allegation by calling the timing "ridiculous" and exaggerates Feinstein's actions by describing her "incredible amount of hypocrisy."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its case.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like "Desperate," "hypocrisy," "antics," "ridiculous," and "corrupt" to shape the reader's perception.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not associate any idea or person with a group hated by the audience, such as Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest the reader should agree with an idea because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex motivations behind Senator Feinstein's actions, attributing them solely to a partisan "last minute gambit" and ignoring other potential reasons.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is not deliberately unclear; its arguments and accusations are direct and easy to understand.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites news outlets like Fox News and The Washington Post, as well as Senator John Cornyn, to lend credibility to its arguments.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by suggesting that if people wanted a real issue, they should look at the "Vince Foster cover-up" instead of the current allegation, framing these as the only two options for scrutiny.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "but this is the Democrats for you" is used to dismiss any complex reasoning about the Democratic party's actions with a simplistic, conversation-ending generalization.

Red herring – Yes – The text abruptly introduces the "Vince Foster cover-up" near the end, a completely different topic meant to distract from the main subject of the Kavanaugh allegation. The poll about Nikki Haley is also an irrelevant distraction.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the idea that Feinstein is making a direct accusation of a crime ("somehow claim that he may have committed a crime"), when her actual statement was more nuanced, simply stating she "referred the matter to federal investigative authorities." This misrepresents her position to make it easier to attack.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text explicitly accuses Senator Feinstein of hypocrisy by contrasting her actions regarding Kavanaugh with her alleged silence on accusations against Rep. Keith Ellison.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a highly negative view of Senator Feinstein and the Democratic party, and to dismiss the allegation against Brett Kavanaugh. It achieves this by employing a dense concentration of propaganda techniques.

The article immediately frames the issue with **Name-calling** ("Desperate Feinstein") and **Loaded Language** ("hypocrisy," "antics"). It heavily relies on **Whataboutism** to charge Feinstein with hypocrisy regarding Keith Ellison, a classic deflection tactic. It uses **Doubt** and **Minimization** to cast the allegation itself as "ridiculous" and a "last minute gambit." The author uses **Causal Oversimplification** and **Thought-terminating clichés** ("this is the Democrats for you") to attribute complex political actions to simple, malicious partisan motives, thereby discouraging critical thought. Furthermore, it introduces multiple **Red Herrings** (the Nikki Haley poll, the Vince Foster cover-up) to distract the reader. The sheer volume and combination of these techniques demonstrate a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than present a balanced and factual account of events.
