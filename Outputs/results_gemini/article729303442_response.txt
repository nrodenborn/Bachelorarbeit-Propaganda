1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Michael Mostyn, CEO of B’nai Brith Canada, who called the report a “whitewash.”
2. Repetition – No – The text is a news report and does not repeat the same message over and over.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text mentions the “Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement,” a name which functions as a memorable phrase for a political goal.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The joint statement from Jewish groups claims the report “insinuates that Jewish students who engage with mainstream Jewish community organizations are permitted to be precluded from holding political office,” which can instill fear in Jewish students about their future participation in campus life.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text states that “Jewish groups on and off campus have denounced the report as flawed,” directly questioning its credibility and findings.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The Jewish groups’ statement accuses the report of minimization by saying it “missed the significance of an anti-Semitic text circulated online before Noah Lew was removed.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The conflict is centered on identity, with votes against Lew being described as “based on his support for Israel and Zionism,” and Lew himself stating, “My Jewish identity was now public, and a target was placed squarely upon me.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text quotes several examples of loaded language used by the involved parties, such as “whitewash,” “hostile atmosphere,” and “condone discrimination.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by suggesting it is popular with a group hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not contain any appeals for people to support an idea because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The report is accused of this technique by concluding the votes against Lew were “motivated by politics,” a simple cause that the Jewish groups argue ignores the more complex context of an anti-Semitic message.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The arguments presented by all sides in the text are direct and not deliberately vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – McGill University uses the findings of its appointed investigator, “former Ombudsperson for Students, Spencer Boudreau,” as authoritative evidence to conclude the vote was not motivated by anti-Semitism.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The central debate is framed as a binary choice: the motivation for the vote was either “political disagreement” or “anti-Semitism,” which presents only two options for what could be a complex mix of motivations among voters.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The report’s statement that “Protests about Israel’s policies cannot be equated with anti-Semitism” is presented as a definitive finding that serves to end discussion on whether the specific actions in this case were anti-Semitic.
16. Red herring – No – All the information presented in the text is relevant to the central controversy.
17. Straw men – Yes – The Jewish groups’ statement claims the report “insinuates that Jewish students who engage with mainstream Jewish community organizations are permitted to be precluded from holding political office,” which refutes a potential implication of the report rather than a direct statement it makes.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain any instances of a party deflecting criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 5% – The text itself is a news article, not a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about a controversy by presenting the different viewpoints involved. It maintains a neutral, journalistic tone and attributes claims and accusations to their specific sources (the university report, the Jewish groups, B’nai Brith Canada). While the text is filled with examples of propaganda techniques being used *by the subjects of the report* (e.g., name-calling, appeals to fear, loaded language), the author of the article is merely reporting on these events, not employing the techniques to push a specific agenda. The text’s structure, which gives voice to conflicting sides, is the antithesis of one-sided propaganda. The low percentage acknowledges the inherent, minimal potential for bias in any news reporting, but the text is overwhelmingly informational rather than persuasive.
