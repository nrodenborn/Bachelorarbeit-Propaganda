Verdict – 0% – The text is a factual news report. Its primary purpose is to inform the public about a confirmed Ebola outbreak. It is characterized by neutral language, specific details, and clear attribution of information to official sources such as the government of the DRC and the World Health Organization. While it uses the "Appeal to authority" technique, this is a standard and necessary practice in journalism to establish the credibility of the information being reported, rather than a manipulative tactic to push a biased agenda. The text lacks the emotional manipulation, logical fallacies, and misleading characteristics typical of propaganda.
