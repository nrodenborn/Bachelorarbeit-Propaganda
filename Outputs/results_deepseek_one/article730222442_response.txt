4. **Appeal to fear** – No. No instillation of fear about alternatives or outcomes.  
5. **Doubt** – No. The text clarifies scientific uncertainty but does not maliciously question credibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No. Descriptions like "violent collision" are proportional to the study's findings.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No. No appeals to patriotism or group identity.

**Verdict – 3% –** The text is a straightforward scientific news report with minimal propagandistic elements. It objectively summarizes research findings from a peer-reviewed journal (*Nature Astronomy*) and quotes experts without emotional manipulation, loaded language, or persuasive intent. The sole minor propagandistic element is the **appeal to authority** (technique #13), where Fraser and the journal are cited to bolster credibility—a standard practice in science communication. However, this is neither excessive nor deceptive. Terms like "space invader" are mildly sensational but contextually accurate. The tone is informative, not agenda-driven. The 3% likelihood reflects this negligible use of authority appeal in an otherwise neutral exposition.
