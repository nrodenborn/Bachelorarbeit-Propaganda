**1. Name calling – Yes – Explanation:**  
The repeated use of the term “Kritarch” (a pejorative label for judges perceived as overstepping their authority) and calling Watson “a treasonous kritarch” are clear examples of name calling.

**2. Repetition – Yes – Explanation:**

The text questions Saris’s authority and motives, casting doubt on her credibility and intentions.

**6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation:**  
The claim that Saris is “throwing a wrench in the works” and “sabotage” exaggerates her actions; calling her “unwilling to submit her hunger for power and ideology to the Constitution and the law” is also an exaggeration.

**7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation:**  
References to the Constitution, the law, and “the will of the people” appeal to patriotism and national identity.

Terms like “sabotage,” “treasonous,” “hunger for power,” and “throw a wrench in the works” are emotionally charged and meant to provoke a strong reaction.

The text uses vague accusations like “sabotage” and “throw a wrench in the works” without specifying concrete actions.

**13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text cites the Constitution and U.S. Code as ultimate authorities to support its argument.

**14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text frames the issue as either following the law (and deporting) or being a “kritarch” who undermines the law, ignoring nuances.

**15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation:**  
Phrases like “Impeachment for her and Watson is the solution” shut down further discussion or consideration.

**16. Red herring – Yes – Explanation:**  
The focus on Saris’s supposed “hunger for power” distracts from the legal arguments about habeas corpus and detention.

### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda.**

**Explanation:**  
The text uses a wide array of propaganda techniques, including name calling, loaded language, appeal to fear, exaggeration, and black-and-white fallacies. It repeatedly labels Judge Saris as a “kritarch,” accuses her of sabotage, and frames her actions as a threat to the Constitution and the nation. The text appeals to patriotism, authority, and uses emotionally charged language to sway the reader. It oversimplifies complex legal issues and discourages nuanced discussion by presenting impeachment as the only solution. The overwhelming use of these techniques, combined with the intent to persuade the audience against Saris and similar judges, makes it almost certain that this is a piece of propaganda.
