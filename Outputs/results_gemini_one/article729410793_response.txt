1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Cardinal Cordes describing Cardinal Marx's suggestion as “truly seems sacrilegious,” which is an insulting label for a theological idea within the Church.
2. Repetition – No – While the core idea of opposing the blessing is repeated through different speakers, the text does not use the technique of repeating the same specific message or phrase over and over.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases used as slogans to rally support.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Archbishop Chaput’s argument that such a blessing would be “spiritually damaging” and “leads persons away from God” is an appeal to the fear of spiritual harm and damnation.
5. Doubt – Yes – The article casts doubt on what Cardinal Marx actually said by detailing the dispute over the translation of his interview, stating his office expressed “concern that CNA's translation constitutes a false reference and does not properly reflect the position of Cardinal Marx.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Cardinal Marx is quoted as saying “I do not really see any problems there” in reference to giving encouragement to people in same-sex unions. From the perspective of his opponents, this is a minimization of what they consider to be grave doctrinal and moral issues.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a shared Catholic identity by framing the argument around faithfulness to official Church teaching. For example: “The Church is in its pastoral care bound to Holy Scripture and to its interpretation through the Church’s Magisterium.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and value-laden words to frame the debate, such as “sacrilegious,” “sodomy,” and “intrinsically disordered.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler, the Nazis, or other similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular. In fact, the arguments against Marx's suggestion are based on tradition, not popularity.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not attribute a complex event to a single, simple cause.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The article highlights how Cardinal Marx's office sought to replace his clear "yes" with a more nuanced and less direct statement, which is presented as a form of vagueness. Example: "The cardinal’s office maintains that rather than saying “yes,”... he answered the question in a more subtle way without giving an explicit “yes.”"
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text is built on appeals to authority. It cites cardinals, an archbishop, and foundational Church documents like “The Catechism of the Catholic Church” to validate its position.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Archbishop Chaput presents a false dichotomy by stating, “There is no love – no charity – without truth,” implying that one must accept his version of "truth" or be completely devoid of charity, ignoring any middle ground or alternative interpretations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Archbishop Chaput uses the phrase, “Jesus said the truth will make us free. Nowhere did he suggest it will make us comfortable.” This is used to shut down discussion about the pastoral harshness of his position by appealing to a higher, unarguable principle.
16. Red herring – No – The article remains focused on the central topic of the theological and pastoral debate over blessing same-sex unions.
17. Straw men – Yes – Cardinal Cordes refutes an argument that was not necessarily presented. He claims those seeking a blessing “aim with their request at the recognition and acceptance of their homosexual way of life,” reframing the motive from a desire for "pastoral care" (as Marx put it) to a demand for "valorization," which is an easier position to attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an opponent by charging them with hypocrisy on an unrelated matter.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly propagandistic. It is not a neutral news report on a theological disagreement but a persuasive article designed to advocate for one side. This is evident from its source (LifeSiteNews, a publication with a strong editorial position), its framing, and its pervasive use of propaganda techniques. The headline immediately frames the opposing view with the loaded term "sacrilegious." The article heavily relies on appeals to authority (Cardinals, Archbishops, the Catechism) to support its preferred view while simultaneously casting doubt on the clarity and statements of the opposing Cardinal. It employs emotionally loaded language ("sodomy," "intrinsically disordered"), logical fallacies like the Black & White Fallacy and Straw Man, and thought-terminating clichés to shut down counter-arguments. The overwhelming space and favorable presentation are given to the voices condemning the proposal, while the proponent's position is presented as confusing, back-pedaling, and doctrinally problematic. The cumulative effect is not to inform the reader about a debate, but to persuade them of the correctness of one specific viewpoint.
