1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the group it criticizes as “Ungrateful reprobates, pretenders, counterfeits and hypocrites” and describes them as “weak and pathetic.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that the “American Church” has failed and that America is being judged like Sodom and Gomorrah is repeated throughout the text. Additionally, the poll question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is repeated verbatim three times.

3. Slogans – No – While the text uses strong, declarative sentences and biblical quotes, it does not employ brief, original, and memorable phrases that function as standalone slogans.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the story of God’s complete destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (“the LORD rained down burning sulfur... Thus he overthrew those cities”) and directly equates it to the current situation, stating God “is judging America today” and this will lead to “destruction that will not be reversed.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively questions the credibility and sincerity of its target group, stating, “Professed Christians in America today talk much of love through inaction, and yet know nothing of it (1 John 3:18)” and “They wear the cross. Yet, they have no testimony of the power of God unto salvation.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming the entire “American Church” teaches submission to tyranny and advocates for sin. It also minimizes alternative interpretations of scripture, stating, “to say God completely destroyed two cities and all their inhabitants for being inhospitable clearly misses the point.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text repeatedly frames the issue as a crisis for “America” and the “American Church,” appealing to a national and religious identity. It explicitly mentions “our American forefathers” to connect its argument to a sense of patriotism.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to evoke a strong reaction, such as “criminals that run rampant,” “murder of 58 million innocent babies,” “prevailing immoralities and debauchers,” and “weak and pathetic.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text uses a variation of this technique by disapproving of its target group by suggesting they are the modern equivalent of a group hated by the audience: “these were the same types of people in Jerusalem crying out ‘Crucify him! Crucify him!’”

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea. In fact, it does the opposite, arguing that the popular or mainstream Christian view is wrong and calling for a righteous minority to stand against it.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex situation. The title itself is an example, and the text concludes, “Why did God judge Sodom and Gomorrah? It's the same reason that he is judging America today... He cannot find the righteous in order to spare her.” This reduces all of America's complex societal problems to a single spiritual failure.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s message is direct, aggressive, and blunt. There is no attempt to be deliberately unclear or obscure; the points are made with forceful clarity.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – This is a primary technique used throughout the text. The author constantly cites the Bible (Genesis, Proverbs, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, etc.), Charles Haddon Spurgeon, and the website “Gotquestions.org” as ultimate, unquestionable authorities to support the argument.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: one must either aggressively fight and judge sin in the manner the author prescribes (the righteous path), or one is a counterfeit Christian promoting anarchy and damning the nation (the wrong path). There is no room for nuance or alternative approaches.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses biblical quotes as unchallengeable statements to end discussion, such as “God must be true and judgment must commence.” The rhetorical question, “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” is also used to discourage any critical thought about the nature of the judgment described.

16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation is entirely irrelevant to the theological argument about Sodom and Gomorrah and the state of the American church. It serves as a distraction to engage the reader on a contemporary political topic and collect user data.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an oversimplified version of an opposing argument by stating, “Those who attempt to explain away the biblical condemnations of homosexuality claim that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was inhospitality.” This sets up a weak argument (that it was *only* inhospitality) which is then easily refuted.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges its target group with hypocrisy by saying, “Instead of reaching out to the greatest demographic here in America, public high schools, they send missionaries to foreign lands to do there what they fail to do for their own here.”

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is an overwhelming example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or encourage nuanced theological discussion, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, militant worldview and condemn a target group (the "American Church" and "professed Christians"). It achieves this by employing a vast arsenal of propaganda techniques. The argument is built on a foundation of logical fallacies, including Causal Oversimplification and the Black & White Fallacy, which create a simplistic and distorted reality. This is reinforced by a constant Appeal to Authority (the Bible) to present its interpretation as infallible. The text heavily relies on emotional manipulation through Name Calling, Loaded Language, and an Appeal to Fear, comparing modern America directly to the fiery destruction of Sodom. It creates a powerful in-group/out-group dynamic by using Flag-Waving and linking opponents to the crowd that crucified Jesus (Reduction ad Hitlerum), while simultaneously casting Doubt on their faith and charging them with hypocrisy (Whataboutism). The inclusion of a completely irrelevant Red Herring (the Kavanaugh poll) further underscores that the article's goal is political persuasion and engagement rather than sincere discourse. The sheer density and variety of these techniques indicate a deliberate effort to indoctrinate rather than educate.
