### Propaganda Technique Analysis:  

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "creepy porn lawyer" (referring to Michael Avenatti), "third rate lawyer," "total low-life," "con artist," "the enraged Left," "left-wingers and feminists."  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on "eleventh-hour" accusations, Democrats' determination to stop Kavanaugh "at all costs," and the "constant repetition of unsupported allegations."  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "high-tech lynching" (quoting Clarence Thomas), "You can kiss the MIDTERMS goodbye."  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings that if Kavanaugh is blocked, "we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime," and losing the midterms if he isn’t confirmed.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions accusers' credibility: Swetnick "kept on attending [parties] anyway," Ford may be "lying or suffering from false memory syndrome," Anita Hill "discredited herself."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: Claims of "fifth and sixth accusations"; Minimization: Downplays Ford’s assault ("Brett did not rape me") and calls allegations "ridiculous," "from the Twilight Zone."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "character-assassination," "luridness," "mean drunk," "salacious," "frenzied, demagogic assault," "mud Democrats have been slinging."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to universally hated groups (e.g., Nazis).  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Cites poll showing "plurality of Americans" oppose Kavanaugh and Rush Limbaugh’s popularity-based warning about midterms.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes Kavanaugh’s falling approval solely to "constant repetition of unsupported allegations in the Trump-hating media," ignoring other factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Language is direct and inflammatory, not deliberately obscure.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Quotes Trump, Rush Limbaugh, Newt Gingrich, and poll data to validate arguments.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Frames the conflict as Democrats seeking to "embarrass and discredit" versus Republicans seeking "truth," and implies confirming Kavanaugh is the only way to save the midterms/conservative judiciary.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "raw power" (Gingrich), "high-tech lynching," "obviously, a lot is riding on the confirmation" – phrases that shut down nuance.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Distracts by discussing Anita Hill’s credibility and Avenatti’s past instead of addressing allegations.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Portrays Democrats as wanting only to "embarrass and discredit Kavanaugh and other Republicans, not get at the truth" (a motive not explicitly stated by Democrats).  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – References Anita Hill’s case to accuse Democrats of hypocrisy: "Only left-wingers and feminists still believe Hill."

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of manipulative techniques to advance a partisan narrative. Key indicators include:  
- **Bias and Demonization**: Relies on *name-calling* (e.g., "creepy porn lawyer," "enraged Left") and *loaded language* to vilify opponents (accusers, Democrats, Avenatti) while valorizing Kavanaugh and Republicans.  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses *appeal to fear* (threats of losing judicial control/midterms) and *exaggeration* (e.g., "increasingly outrageous claims") to stoke urgency.  
- **Distortion of Reality**: Employs *doubt* to undermine accusers, *causal oversimplification* to blame media bias, and *straw men* to misrepresent Democratic motives.  
- **Rhetorical Suppression**: *Thought-terminating clichés* ("raw power") and *black/white fallacies* discourage critical analysis of the allegations.  
- **Selective Evidence**: Omits due process arguments for investigations while emphasizing Kavanaugh’s denials and FBI background checks.  
- **Agenda-Driven Framing**: The title ("Avenatti’s Freak Show") sets a mocking tone, and the text consistently aligns with pro-Trump, anti-Left messaging, dismissing accusations as a coordinated "character-assassination."  

While it reports factual events (e.g., accusers’ claims, hearing details), the pervasive slant—painting accusers as irrational or malicious and Democrats as power-hungry—renders it propaganda. The 5% uncertainty reflects the inclusion of verifiable quotes (e.g., Kavanaugh’s testimony), though these are embedded in a manipulative context. Overall, the text aims to delegitimize opposition rather than neutrally inform.
