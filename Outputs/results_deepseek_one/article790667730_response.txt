Based on the definitions provided and the text about Senator Lindsey Graham's comments during the Brett Kavanaugh hearing, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes –** "most unethical sham" (used by Graham to label the Democrats' actions).
2.  **Repetition – Yes –** "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" (repeated verbatim three times in the poll section).
3.  **Slogans – No –** No distinct, memorable phrase is created or highlighted as a slogan within the core text about Graham/Kavanaugh.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes –** "Boy, y'all want power. Boy, I hope you never get it." (Suggests Democrats gaining power is something to be feared).
5.  **Doubt – Yes –** "believing every word of Dr. Christine Ford without any evidence. In fact, all of the evidence and all of the witnesses to date... refute her claims." (Explicitly questions Ford's credibility and the basis for believing her).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes –** "most unethical sham since I've been in politics" (Exaggerates the severity of the Democrats' actions). Also, Kavanaugh saying he'd been "through hell and then some" is presented dramatically.
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes –** "I hope the American people can see through this sham" (Appeals to the audience as "the American people" to judge the situation patriotically).
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes –** "Unleashes Firestorm", "berated", "relentless assault", "blasted", "destroy this guy's life", "sham", "hell" (These words carry strong negative connotations and evoke emotional responses).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No –** No comparison to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally despised groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon – Yes –** "he said what many of us thought should have been said" (Appeals to the popularity of the sentiment among "us").
11. **Causal Oversimplification – No –** The text doesn't oversimplify the cause of a complex event; it focuses on assigning blame for a current situation.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No –** The language used is direct and accusatory, not deliberately vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority – No –** While Graham is a Senator, the text doesn't primarily rely on citing an external authority figure's support as evidence for its claims. It relies on Graham's own statements and the author's perspective.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes –** The narrative strongly implies a dichotomy: righteous Republicans (Graham, Kavanaugh) telling the truth vs. unethical, power-hungry Democrats running a "sham" and conducting a "relentless assault". Nuance is absent.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes –** "I hope the American people can see through this sham" (Shuts down further discussion by implying the situation is self-evidently a deceptive ploy).
16. **Red herring – Yes –** The entire section about "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" (repeated poll) is completely irrelevant to the Graham/Kavanaugh story and serves as a distraction.
17. **Straw men – Yes –** Graham states, "What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020." This attributes extreme, destructive motives ("destroy this guy's life") to the Democrats that they did not explicitly state, refuting an argument they didn't make.
18. **Whataboutism – No –** The text does not charge the Democrats with hypocrisy by pointing to their own past actions on a similar issue. It accuses them directly of misconduct in *this* instance.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs numerous propaganda techniques: Name-calling ("sham"), Repetition (poll question), Appeal to fear (Democrats gaining power), Doubt (against Ford), Exaggeration ("most unethical sham", "hell"), Flag-waving (appeal to "American people"), Loaded Language ("firestorm", "assault", "destroy"), Bandwagon ("many of us thought"), Black & white fallacy (good vs. evil framing), Thought-terminating clichés ("see through this sham"), Red herring (UN ambassador poll), and Straw men (attributing destructive intent). The author admits bias ("I'm not a fan... but"), presents a one-sided, emotionally charged narrative that vilifies one side (Democrats) while valorizing the other (Graham/Kavanaugh), and uses manipulative language to persuade the reader towards a specific political viewpoint rather than providing a balanced or evidence-based report. The inclusion of the irrelevant poll also serves a clear propagandistic function (driving engagement/potential data collection under the guise of the main story). While based on a real event, the framing, language, and techniques used strongly indicate propaganda.
