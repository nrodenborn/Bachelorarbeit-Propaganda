1. Name calling – Yes – The author describes Ted Cruz's actions as a "repugnant and outright disrespectful move" and refers to those who defend the police as "apologists."
2. Repetition – Yes – The phrase "she killed an innocent man" is repeated in various forms throughout the text. Additionally, the poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – No – While the text uses strong and memorable phrasing, it does not employ a specific, brief slogan that is repeated to encapsulate a core message.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear around the idea of a justice system that does not hold police accountable, stating, "how young black men continue to be killed in this country without accountability, without justice... This cannot continue."
5. Doubt – Yes – The article questions the credibility and motives of Ted Cruz ("Are You Kidding Me, Ted Cruz?") and the entire law enforcement system, suggesting it is biased: "From the start of this case, law enforcement have set out to protect Guyger because she is part of their blue line."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates Cruz's position by stating he "lashed out" and went "to bat for Amber Guyger," while his quoted remarks are a call for due process. It also minimizes the complexity of the legal situation by stating, "She is the only one to blame."
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national pride. Its appeals are based on morality, justice, and identity politics rather than nationalism.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like "repugnant," "outright disrespectful," "pillar of society," "lashed out," and "horrifically flawed system" to influence the reader's emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare Ted Cruz or his supporters to Hitler or any other group hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The article does not suggest that its viewpoint is correct because it is popular. Instead, it argues from a moral position of "right versus wrong."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The article simplifies the reason for the controversy to a single cause: "What Ted Cruz is doing is the same thing the police and their apologists are doing. They are treating Guyger differently because she is part of the system." This ignores the complex legal principle of "innocent until proven guilty" that Cruz is referencing.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and clear in its argument and accusations. It does not use vague or obscure language to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text critiques an authority figure (Ted Cruz) rather than using one to support its claims. It quotes Beto O'Rourke, but as a point of contrast, not as the primary evidence for its own argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text explicitly frames the situation as having only two sides: "This is not some case of Democrat versus Republican or right versus left. This is a case of right versus wrong."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "This is a case of right versus wrong" is used to shut down nuanced discussion. Similarly, "There is no other way around it" discourages any critical thought about alternative perspectives or complexities.
16. Red herring – Yes – The embedded poll asking "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is completely irrelevant to the topic of the article and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The article refutes a simplified and distorted version of Cruz's argument. It claims Cruz is writing the event off as a "tragic accident," whereas Cruz's actual quote calls for waiting for the investigation's results before drawing conclusions: "She may have been in the wrong … but I don’t think we should jump to conclusions."
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text uses a hypothetical role-reversal to charge Cruz and the police with hypocrisy: "Would Ted Cruz and police officers be following this same narrative if the roles were reversed? ... Of course, we know the answer to that question and it is a resounding, NO."

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, emotionally-charged viewpoint by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. The article uses loaded language, name-calling, and appeals to fear to create an immediate emotional response against Ted Cruz and the police. It deliberately simplifies a complex legal situation into a black & white fallacy of "right versus wrong," using thought-terminating clichés to discourage any nuanced consideration of principles like due process. Furthermore, it builds and attacks a straw man version of Cruz's argument and uses whataboutism to accuse him of hypocrisy. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring poll further underscores that the piece is not a work of objective journalism. While it is based on a real event and includes factual quotes, the framing, tone, and rhetorical strategies are all geared towards manipulation, making it a clear example of propaganda.
