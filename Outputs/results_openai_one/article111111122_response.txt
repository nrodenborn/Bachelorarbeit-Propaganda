Certainly! Here’s the analysis for each propaganda technique, followed by the final verdict:

---

**1. Name calling – No –** There is criticism of Trump, but no use of insulting labels (e.g., “idiot,” “monster,” etc.) as defined by the technique.

**2. Repetition – No –** The text does not repeat the same message or phrase over and over.

**3. Slogans – No –** There are no brief, memorable phrases used as rallying slogans.

**4. Appeal to fear – No –** The text criticizes Trump’s handling of the nomination but does not attempt to instill fear about alternatives.

**5. Doubt – Yes –** The text questions Trump’s competence and decision-making: “We don’t know to what extent Kavanaugh was Trump’s choice and to what extent he was manipulated into choosing him.” Also, “we have plenty of evidence that Trump is easily manipulated by those around him.”

**6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes –** The phrase “he has managed to make a complete hash of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination” exaggerates Trump’s failure. Also, “a gang that can’t shoot straight” is an exaggeration of dysfunction.

**7. Flag-Waving – No –** There is no appeal to patriotism or national identity.

**8. Loaded Language – Yes –** Phrases like “a gang that can’t shoot straight,” “make a complete hash,” and “his behavior has been as erratic as ever” use emotionally charged language to shape perception.

**9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No –** There are no comparisons to Nazis or other universally reviled groups.

**10. Bandwagon – No –** The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea or suggest “everyone thinks this.”

**11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes –** The text implies that Trump’s personal flaws alone are responsible for the nomination’s troubles, oversimplifying a complex political process: “It’s a good example of how badly Trump does his job more than a year and a half into his administration.”

**12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No –** The text is direct and clear in its criticisms.

**13. Appeal to authority – Yes –** The text references political scientist Richard Neustadt: “As the political scientist Richard Neustadt said, political elites are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating the president.”

**14. Black & white fallacy – No –** The text does not reduce the situation to only two options.

**15. Thought-terminating clichés – No –** There are no clichés used to shut down discussion.

**16. Red herring – No –** The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main issue.

**17. Straw men – No –** The text does not misrepresent opposing arguments to refute them.

**18. Whataboutism – No –** The text does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy.

### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 35% –**  
While the text is highly critical and contains elements of loaded language, doubt, exaggeration, and some appeal to authority, it largely remains an opinion analysis rather than outright propaganda. The author presents a negative assessment of Trump’s handling of the Kavanaugh nomination, using strong language and some rhetorical devices common in persuasive writing. However, the text does not employ the majority of classic propaganda techniques such as slogans, name-calling, bandwagon, or appeals to fear. The presence of some techniques (doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and appeal to authority) suggests a moderate likelihood of propaganda intent, but the overall structure and tone are more consistent with critical editorializing than systematic propaganda. The likelihood is therefore moderate, not high.
