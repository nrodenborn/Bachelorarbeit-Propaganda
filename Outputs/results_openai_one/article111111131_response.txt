Certainly! Here is the analysis of each propaganda technique as applied to the provided text:

---

1. **Name calling** – No – There are references to Kim as a "despotic leader" and "brutal dictator," but these are factual descriptions rather than invented or exaggerated labels used to insult for propaganda purposes.
2. **Repetition** – No – There is no repeated phrase or idea used to hammer home a message.
3. **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries.
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text mentions past fears of war, but does not use fear to support a particular idea or action.
5. **Doubt** – Yes – The text questions the credibility and substance of the summit's outcome: "But there were scant details on what new commitments had been secured from Kim," and "Whether nuclear disarmament is indeed the final outcome...won't be known for years, if not decades."
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The text minimizes the achievements: "just vague pledges of nuclear disarmament," "scant details," and "did not appear to go beyond what he already pledged."
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like "despotic leader," "brutal dictator," "gut-driven, norm-shattering tenure," "acrimonious relationship," and "fearsome renegade regime" are emotionally charged and convey strong connotations.

10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is correct because many people believe it.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text does not attribute a complex event to a single cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – The text refers to "vague pledges," "scant details," and "no mentioning the previous US aim," highlighting the lack of clarity and specifics in the summit's outcomes.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – There is no reliance on the opinion of an authority as evidence.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text does not present only two options or force a binary choice.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no clichés used to shut down discussion or critical thought.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The mention of Dennis Rodman weeping, Larry Kudlow's heart attack, and the dessert menu serve as distractions from the main topic of the summit’s substance.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent an opposing argument to refute it.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse anyone of hypocrisy by bringing up unrelated issues.

**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict – 30% –**  
While the text employs some propaganda techniques—such as doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, obfuscation, and red herrings—it largely maintains the tone and structure of a critical news report rather than outright propaganda. The article scrutinizes the summit, questions its outcomes, and uses emotionally charged language, but it does not overtly attempt to manipulate the audience into a particular belief or action through systematic or coordinated propaganda tactics. The presence of some techniques raises the likelihood above zero, but the overall approach is more analytical and descriptive than propagandistic. Thus, there is a moderate (about 30%) chance that the text could be considered propaganda, mainly due to its use of loaded language and minimization, but it does not fully fit the definition of propaganda as deliberate, systematic manipulation of opinion.
