### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of manipulative techniques to advance a biased narrative. Key indicators include:  
- **Selective Evidence**: Relies on cherry-picked emails (Murillo, Schmidt) and Trump’s tweet while omitting counter-evidence or legal context.  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language ("colluded," "disgraced") and name-calling polarize readers.  
- **Distraction & Deflection**: Red herrings (Strzok scandal) and whataboutism shift focus from Russian interference to Google/Clinton.  
- **Oversimplification**: Reduces Clinton’s loss to Latino voting trends and frames Google’s actions as unequivocally illegal.  
- **Source Bias**: Uses partisan figures (Tucker Carlson, Trump) and contested sources (WikiLeaks) without neutrality.  
The text’s goal is to delegitimize Clinton/Google and defend Trump by fabricating equivalence between unproven claims ("silent donations") and documented election interference. Only minor restraint (e.g., no explicit fear-mongering or flag-waving) prevents a 100% rating.
