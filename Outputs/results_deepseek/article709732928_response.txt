### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **One-sided narrative**: Exclusively frames the Uranium One deal as a criminal conspiracy by Clinton/Obama officials while absolving Trump. Ignores exonerating investigations (e.g., 2015 FBI/Russian bribery case had no Clinton ties).  
2. **Emotional manipulation**: Uses fear ("national security compromise"), loaded terms ("racketeering," "corruption"), and urgency ("beginning to cascade") to provoke outrage.  
3. **Unverified claims**: Presents allegations (e.g., "Russia’s plot to control U.S. nuclear fuel") as fact without evidence. Documents mentioned are not disclosed or independently verified.  
4. **Source bias**: Relies on hyper-partisan figures (Hannity), a Clinton-critical attorney (Toensing), and outlets (Fox News) while omitting counter-perspectives.  
5. **Propaganda techniques**: Employs 11/18 identified techniques (e.g., name-calling, repetition, fear appeals) to delegitimize targets (Clinton/Obama) and valorize allies (informant, reporters).  
6. **Sensationalism**: "Bombshell," "exploding scandal," and "treasure trove" exaggerate significance. The Clinton Foundation "money trail" is insinuated but unproven.  

**Why not 100%?**  
The text references real entities (CFIUS, Uranium One) and investigations, but its selective framing, omission of exculpatory facts (e.g., no evidence Clinton influenced the deal), and reliance on emotional persuasion confirm its propagandistic intent.
