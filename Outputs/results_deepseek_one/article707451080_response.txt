Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "corrupt career politicians" (Labeling targets with an insulting term).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Variations of "drain the swamp" and "take our government back" are repeated for emphasis.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "drain the swamp" (A brief, memorable phrase encapsulating the core message).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "the rest of the world is laughing at us", "we have become a bad joke", implying America's status and respect are crumbling due to this corruption, motivating action to avoid shame.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "If members of Congress are engaged in this type of behavior, why don’t the American people know about it? And why are those members of Congress still allowed to serve?" (Questions the transparency and accountability of Congress).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "deep the corruaption runs" (Exaggerates the extent/pervasiveness). Minimization is not present.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While patriotism is implied ("take our government back", "leaders of our nation"), there is no explicit appeal *to* patriotism or national identity as the primary motivator.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "deeply disturbing", "truly disgusting", "predatory behavior", "shameful behavior", "hostile-free work environment", "Weinstein-level", "bad joke" (Uses emotionally charged words to evoke disgust and outrage).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups to discredit the opposition.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "The American people are not going to put up with this any longer", "we simply are not going to put up with it anymore" (Appeals to the idea that the public is already turning against this, urging readers to join).
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The problem (sexual harassment/corruption) is presented as complex, not attributed to a single simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – While specific perpetrators are unnamed (understandably, given allegations), the descriptions of events and the $15M figure are presented as concrete facts, not deliberately vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Rep. Jackie Speier, Rep. Barbara Comstock, CNN interviews, and an anonymous ex-Secret Service agent as sources lending credibility to the claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as corrupt politicians vs. the need to "clean up our government" and "drain the swamp", implying these are the only options. "Those that have been engaging in this sort of shameful behavior have got to go" presents removal as the only solution.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "drain the swamp" (A simplistic phrase used to encapsulate a complex problem and solution, discouraging deeper analysis).
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Introducing the detailed allegations against Joe Biden (a figure not in Congress during the timeframe discussed and unrelated to the $15M House fund) distracts from the main subject of Congressional harassment and the fund.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks the alleged behavior of specific politicians and the system enabling it, not a misrepresented version of an opposing argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Shifting focus to Joe Biden's alleged behavior ("Of course, this sort of behavior is not just limited to members of Congress... Joe Biden was regularly engaged...") after detailing Congressional issues charges opponents (Democrats/establishment figures) with hypocrisy or deflects criticism by implying "others do it too".

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. While based on factual reports (CNN interviews, Speier/Comstock testimonies, the $15M figure), the presentation is heavily manipulative:
*   It relies extensively on **Loaded Language** and **Appeal to Fear/Emotion** to evoke outrage and disgust.
*   It uses **Name Calling**, **Repetition**, and **Slogans** ("drain the swamp") to frame the targets negatively and hammer home the message.
*   It employs **Bandwagon** to suggest a growing public consensus demanding action.
*   It utilizes **Appeal to Authority** selectively (citing sources supporting its narrative) while casting **Doubt** on the system.
*   It presents the issue in **Black & White** terms and uses a **Thought-terminating cliché** ("drain the swamp") to oversimplify the solution.
*   Crucially, it uses **Red Herring** and **Whataboutism** by bringing in unrelated allegations against Joe Biden, a classic tactic to distract and broaden the attack beyond the initial subject.
The primary purpose is not just to inform about sexual harassment payouts, but to fuel anger, demonize "corrupt career politicians," promote a specific political agenda ("drain the swamp," electing the author), and discredit political opponents through distraction (Biden). The sourcing from Breitbart and "End of the American Dream" further signals a partisan, agenda-driven perspective. While containing factual elements, the overwhelming use of manipulative techniques marks this as propaganda. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the underlying factual basis of the core harassment claims within Congress.
