Verdict – 10% – The text is primarily a factual report on the removal of a Guatemalan national by ICE. It provides specific details about the case and the actions taken by the authorities. The only propaganda technique present is the appeal to authority, as it mentions ICE and ERO as authoritative bodies. However, this is a standard practice in news reporting to establish credibility and does not necessarily indicate propaganda. Therefore, the likelihood of the text being propaganda is low.
