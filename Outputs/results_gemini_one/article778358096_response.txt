Name calling – Yes – The text labels Islam as a "totalitarian, religious/political construct that is full of oppression" and refers to the prophet Muhammad as a "desert nomad."

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text links the subjects to a plan of "training [children] to engage in mass school shootings," a concept designed to evoke fear in the reader.

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the mosque spokesman's claim that the incident was a "domestic situation" by stating, "That's hardly a 'domestic situation.'"

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text accuses the mosque spokesman of minimization by quoting his claim that it was "nothing more than a 'domestic situation.'" It then exaggerates the implications of the event by generalizing it to "the history of Islam."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "Islamic jihadis," "terrible conditions," "'third world' conditions," and describes Islam as a "totalitarian, religious/political construct that is full of oppression."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is true because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple cause for the suspects' alleged actions: "When you have those that actually believe the Koran and follow in the footsteps of the desert nomad Muhammad, then you will not find radicals, but devout Muslims. This appears to be exactly what Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and others arrested at the compound are."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text's arguments, while biased, are presented directly rather than through intentionally vague or confusing language.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites news organizations like "Fox News," the "Associated Press," and the "Atlanta Constitution-Journal" to support its claims about the weapons training.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy between "nice" Muslims (implying they don't truly follow their faith) and "devout Muslims" who, according to the author, are inherently like the suspects in the article.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; instead, it actively tries to guide the reader to a specific conclusion.

Red herring – Yes – The text inserts a completely unrelated poll: "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" This serves no purpose to the story and acts as a distraction.

Straw men – Yes – The text constructs and refutes a generalized argument that was not explicitly made by a specific opponent: "People can continue to put their heads in the sand all they want to because they know 'nice' Muslim people..."

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any opponent of hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it is anchored in a real news event and cites legitimate sources (AP, Fox News), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, hostile ideology towards Islam. The article uses the horrific details of a crime as a springboard to make broad, negative generalizations about an entire religion and its followers.

It employs a wide array of propaganda techniques to achieve this. It uses Loaded Language ("Islamic jihadis," "totalitarian") and Name Calling ("desert nomad") to create an emotional, negative association. It stokes fear by focusing on the "school shootings" angle. It creates a Causal Oversimplification and a Black & White Fallacy by arguing that the suspects' actions are the natural result of being a "devout Muslim," as opposed to a "nice" one. This dismisses all other possible factors (mental illness, poverty, personal history) and forces a simplistic, biased conclusion.

Furthermore, the inclusion of a completely irrelevant Red Herring poll about Brett Kavanaugh is a hallmark of a publication focused on engagement and data capture rather than journalistic integrity. The author explicitly injects their own opinion throughout, refuting counter-arguments with Straw Men and casting Doubt on any narrative that does not fit their own. The final sentence, "Justice should be served swift, and I don't mean a lengthy jail term," is a clear call for a specific, violent outcome, moving the piece from biased reporting into pure advocacy. The factual elements are merely a vehicle for the propaganda.
