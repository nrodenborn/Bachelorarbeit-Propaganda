Name calling – Yes – The text attacks individuals with insulting labels, such as calling Peter Strzok and Lisa Page “immoral FBI philanderers” and Strzok the “big bad guy in the FBI mess.”

Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is repeated three times in a row. The core message about the FBI's bias, particularly Strzok's, is also repeated throughout the article.

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear by suggesting a deep, politically motivated corruption within the FBI, asking, “How in the world can we trust them even as they express bias while investigating malfeasance?” This creates anxiety about the integrity of national law enforcement.

Doubt – Yes – The article is built around questioning the credibility of the FBI and its investigation, stating, “The messages cast a cloud over the FBI investigations to which these employees were assigned,” and repeatedly questioning if the agents’ actions were “free from bias.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the situation by calling it “INSANE” and labeling Strzok the “big bad guy.” It also minimizes the IG’s official conclusion that there was no proof of political bias by immediately suggesting the IG “left the door open” for that possibility.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a betrayal of national trust, stating that the agents’ actions harmed the FBI’s “reputation with the American people.” The source names like “Constitution.com” and “Freedom Outpost” also appeal to a patriotic identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as “Rips,” “lambaste,” “slams,” “immoral FBI philanderers,” and “damned Hillary Clinton.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with hated groups like Nazis to discredit it.

Bandwagon – Yes – The embedded poll, “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” assumes a popular consensus that these politicians are corrupt and invites the reader to join in the act of condemning them.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies a complex investigation by suggesting a single cause for the outcome, stating that Peter Strzok “may be the only reason she was never charged with a crime.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague speculation about future findings to create suspicion, for example: “it also indicates that IG Horowitz may have more to say about the FBI’s political leanings in his Russia report” and “Horowitz’ conclusion in the Russia investigation could prove to be even worse.”

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text selectively quotes the Inspector General’s report to support its claims. It also cites other sources like “Fox News” and “John Sexton” at “HotAir.com” as authorities to bolster its argument.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice: either the FBI was completely corrupt and biased, or it was honorable. It frames the investigation’s outcome as hinging entirely on Strzok’s word choice (“grossly negligent” vs. “extremely careless”), ignoring other potential complexities and factors.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The article does not use phrases or clichés designed to shut down discussion.

Red herring – Yes – The poll asking “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is an irrelevant distraction. The article is about the Clinton email investigation, but the poll introduces a list of other Democrats, diverting the reader’s attention to a different topic.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument not explicitly presented. After mentioning Strzok’s defense that his texts were not a promise of official action, the article ignores that nuance and proceeds to argue against the most sinister interpretation of his words, as if that was his actual position.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text brings up other cases to imply hypocrisy, noting that the media questioned why Clinton got a pass “when ‘Petraeus/Berger/Libby’ did not,” deflecting from the specific facts of the Clinton investigation by pointing to other individuals.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and powerful example of propaganda. It is not a neutral news report but a highly biased piece of commentary that uses a vast array of propaganda techniques to promote a specific narrative. The article’s primary goal is not to inform the reader about the contents of the IG report, but to persuade the reader that the FBI is a corrupt, politically biased institution.

It achieves this through a relentless use of loaded language (“rips,” “slams,” “immoral philanderers”) and name-calling to create a negative emotional tone from the outset. It systematically sows doubt about the investigation's official conclusions, minimizing the report's finding of no proven bias while exaggerating any detail that suggests bias. The piece relies on causal oversimplification, pinning the entire outcome of the Clinton investigation on one or two individuals like Peter Strzok.

Furthermore, it employs structural propaganda like a red herring poll to distract and a bandwagon appeal to create a sense of consensus. The selective use of the IG report as an authority—quoting only the parts that support its narrative—is a key manipulative tactic. The combination of these techniques creates a text designed to provoke an emotional, partisan response and reinforce a pre-existing belief system, rather than encourage critical thought about the complex issue at hand.
