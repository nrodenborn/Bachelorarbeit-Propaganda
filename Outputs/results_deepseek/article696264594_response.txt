Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "anti-Israel BDS hate group", "anti-Semite", "anti-Israel activists", "radical anti-Jewish and anti-Israel left".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeatedly labeling JVP as a "hate group" and emphasizing AJHS's partnership with them; repeatedly stating that the events attack/eliminate Israel.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, brief, memorable phrase is created and repeated as a slogan within the text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Instills fear about the destruction of Israel ("eliminating Israel"), the normalization of extreme hatred, the silencing of opposition ("blacklist, smear and silence"), and invokes Nazi Germany ("When we think about Nazi Germany...").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions the credibility of AJHS ("appears to be uninterested", "perversion"), CJH, David N. Myers, and the claim of "apolitical scholarship".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: Labeling JVP as linked to "literal blood libels"; implying the events represent AJHS's sole focus ("the only listed AJHS programs that focus on Israel"); stating "there's only one perspective" when it comes to Israel. Minimization: Downplaying the legitimacy of differing views as merely "anti-Israel hatred".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to Jewish identity and loyalty: "stand with... Jews", references to Leo Forchheimer's philanthropy in Israel, framing the issue as betrayal of Jewish history and organizations.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "hate group", "defends anti-Semitism", "perversion", "tragic", "corruption", "scandal", "supreme sacrifice" (referring to suicide bombers), "conspiracy theories", "infamous", "apolitical scholarship" (used sarcastically), "obscenely simple", "blacklist, smear and silence".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Explicitly invokes Nazi Germany and the failure to rise against anti-Semitism then as a parallel to the current situation: "When we think about Nazi Germany...".
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – While it mentions the anti-Israel left's networks and power, it doesn't appeal to the popularity of its *own* position as a reason to adopt it. It emphasizes the difficulty of opposition.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes AJHS's actions solely to being "packed with anti-Israel activists" and the influence of David N. Myers, simplifying complex organizational dynamics and motivations.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and accusatory, not vague or obscure. It names names and makes specific claims.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Daniel Greenfield's fellowship ("Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center") to establish credibility at the start. Also uses historical authority ("History tells us...").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents a stark, forced choice: "Either you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews." Also, "when it comes to Israel, there’s only one perspective."
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – While it uses strong language, it doesn't employ simplistic phrases specifically designed to shut down thought (e.g., "it is what it is"). Its arguments, though biased, are elaborated.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on the AJHS-JVP partnership, the speakers, and the alleged anti-Israel bias. While it brings in related topics (Myers, academic councils), these are presented as directly connected evidence, not irrelevant distractions.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – It attacks specific statements and actions attributed to JVP, Kuttab, Herbst, Fishback, and AJHS. While these are presented negatively, it doesn't refute arguments *not* made by them.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text doesn't deflect criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy unrelated to the core issue. It focuses on the actions of AJHS and JVP.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of definitive propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Reduction ad Hitlerum, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy). Its primary purpose is not neutral reporting but to aggressively persuade the reader to condemn AJHS, JVP, and their associated speakers by:
1.  **Emotionally Charged Demonization:** Relentlessly labeling opponents as a "hate group," "anti-Semitic," and linking them to extreme concepts like "blood libels," "terrorism," and "Nazi Germany."
2.  **Simplification and Polarization:** Reducing a complex historical and political debate to a simple, absolute choice between good ("Jews") and evil ("BDS, Hamas, blood libels").
3.  **Fear Mongering:** Framing the events and partnerships as existential threats to Israel and Jewish identity, warning of silencing, and invoking historical persecution.
4.  **Bias and Selective Framing:** Presenting only one side of the issue, dismissing alternative perspectives as illegitimate "anti-Israel hatred," and interpreting all actions through the lens of a deliberate anti-Israel agenda.
While it contains factual elements (event details, speaker affiliations, quotes), these are embedded within and overwhelmingly dominated by the persuasive techniques listed above. The text's structure, language, and arguments are designed to provoke outrage and agreement with its specific viewpoint, making it overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of factual claims within the highly manipulative framework.
