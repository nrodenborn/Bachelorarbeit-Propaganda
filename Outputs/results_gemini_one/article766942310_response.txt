Name calling – Yes – The author labels Kim Jong-un as "delinquent" and John Bolton as "a fanatic's fanatic."

Repetition – No – The text builds a consistent argument but does not repeat a specific message or phrase over and over to reinforce it.

Slogans – No – The text quotes a slogan-like headline from another source ("Kim Jong Won!") but does not use slogans as its own primary method of persuasion.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The author dismisses Trump's assurances of safety by detailing North Korea's remaining military threats, stating, "This is a very real threat – one that is largely immune to attack from the air. I have seen these emplacements from the northern edge of the DMZ. Kim’s big guns hold Seoul’s millions of inhabitants hostage."

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is framed to cast doubt on the success and substance of the summit, suggesting it "produced very little – at least so far" and that Trump's motives were merely "show-biz."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author minimizes the summit's outcome by calling it "a very expensive photo op" and exaggerates the effect on allies by calling it a "huge humiliation" and a "terrible insult."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to American patriotism; in fact, it is critical of the American president's actions on the world stage.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as describing the two leaders as "schoolyard bullies" and having a "love-fest between the two chunky leaders."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Nazis or other universally hated groups to discredit them.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea should be accepted because it is popular. It cites The Economist, which is an appeal to a specific authority, not a general trend.

Causal Oversimplification – No – While the author has a strong bias, the article provides multiple complex reasons for the author's conclusion, including military specifics, historical context, and diplomatic consequences, rather than attributing the outcome to a single, simple cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's language is direct and clear, using specific examples and details to make a very clear point.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The author begins by citing and agreeing with "The Economist Magazine" and its "best-ever headline" to lend credibility to their own argument.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The article frames the summit in the binary terms of a "win" or a loss ("Who ‘Won’ the Trump-Kim Summit?"), concluding Kim "certainly came out ahead" and that "nothing basic has been resolved," ignoring any possibility of nuanced or incremental progress.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down debate; it presents an argument intended to persuade the reader to adopt its specific viewpoint.

Red herring – Yes – The author introduces an irrelevant personal detail at the beginning of the article: "Just out of hospital, I was in no shape to compete with the great Economist". This has no bearing on the geopolitical analysis that follows.

Straw men – No – The author directly engages with and refutes claims they attribute to President Trump (e.g., that Americans can "sleep peacefully"), rather than misrepresenting his argument to make it easier to attack.

Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes President Trump's actions directly and does not attempt to deflect from this criticism by accusing him of hypocrisy regarding an unrelated issue.

***

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It is not a neutral, objective analysis of the summit but a persuasive opinion piece that uses numerous propaganda techniques to advance a specific, one-sided argument. The author employs name-calling ("delinquent Kim"), loaded language ("love-fest between the two chunky leaders"), and appeals to fear (by detailing North Korea's unchecked military power) to shape the reader's perception. The piece casts significant doubt on the official narrative of the summit's success, minimizes its achievements ("expensive photo op"), and frames the event in a black-and-white fallacy of a "win" for Kim and a loss for the U.S. By leaning on the authority of 'The Economist' and presenting a highly critical and emotionally charged viewpoint, the text's primary goal is to persuade the reader to adopt its conclusion, rather than to provide a balanced report.
