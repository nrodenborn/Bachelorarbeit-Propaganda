1. Name calling – Yes – The author labels some college courses as "ridiculous" and describes sociology as creating a "toxic stew of racism and meaningless jargon" and a "perfect storm of sociology stupidity."
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that sociology is a foolish or worthless field of study is repeated throughout the text, such as in the lines "It's sociology that worries me," "perfect storm of sociology stupidity," and "Sociology. You really don't need to know anything."
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase "Sociology. You really don't need to know anything" is used as a short, memorable, and dismissive summary of the author's argument.
4. Appeal to fear – No – While the author expresses "worry" about sociology, the text focuses on ridicule and disdain rather than trying to instill genuine fear in the reader about the consequences of sociology.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is structured to cast doubt on the credibility of sociology as a discipline and its professors. The central anecdote of a professor not knowing Australia is a country is used to question the competence of everyone in the field.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the failings of a single professor to represent the entire field of sociology, calling it a "toxic stew" and a "perfect storm of sociology stupidity."
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its point.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases designed to evoke a negative response, such as "ridiculous courses," "toxic stew," "meaningless jargon," and "absolute ignorance."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not associate sociology with any groups widely hated by the audience, like Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The author does not suggest that their view is correct because it is popular. In fact, they frame their argument as being against a popular trend in academia.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author blames the entire field of sociology for creating "a whole range of fake new academic subjects" and corrupting others, which is a simplistic explanation for complex trends in academia.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's language is direct and their point is clear, even if polemical. They are not trying to be intentionally vague or confusing.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents the student's correct use of an appeal to authority (citing a research starter from the university library) as a point of contrast against the professor's ignorance, thereby using the validity of that authority to support its own argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text creates a false dichotomy between the author's "common sense" view and the "toxic stew" of sociology, implying there are no nuanced or valid perspectives within the field.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The line "Sociology. You really don't need to know anything" is used as a dismissive, oversimplified conclusion intended to end any nuanced discussion about the value of the discipline.
16. Red herring – Yes – The author mentions the professor has a "PhD in philosophy" followed by the sarcastic comment "Of course she does." This is an irrelevant detail used to subtly attack another academic field and distract from the specific issue within the sociology class.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author builds a straw man of sociology, defining it as merely a "politically correct premise and absolute ignorance." The author also invents the "My truth" argument and attributes it to the professor to make her position seem more ridiculous and easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing its opponents of hypocrisy; it maintains a direct attack on its target.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform the reader about a specific incident but to persuade them to adopt a negative view of the entire academic field of sociology. It achieves this by employing a vast number of propaganda techniques. The central argument relies on a massive exaggeration, using a single, extreme anecdote about one professor to condemn an entire discipline. It is saturated with loaded language ("toxic stew," "stupidity") and name-calling ("ridiculous courses") to create an emotional, rather than a rational, response. The author constructs a straw man of sociology, misrepresenting it as a field requiring only "absolute ignorance," and then attacks this caricature. The piece also uses a black & white fallacy, presenting the issue as a simple conflict between common sense and academic absurdity, ignoring any possibility of nuance. The sheer density of these manipulative techniques, all aimed at pushing a single, biased viewpoint, confirms its status as propaganda.
