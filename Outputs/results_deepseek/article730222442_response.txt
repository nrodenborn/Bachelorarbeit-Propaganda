Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the given text:

1. Name calling – No – No insulting labels are applied to the subject ('Oumuamua) or any opposing views.
2. Repetition – No – Key terms like "tumbling" or "collision" are used contextually but not excessively repeated for persuasive effect.
3. Slogans – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to promote an ideology or agenda (e.g., no rallying cries).
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text describes scientific observations without instilling fear about alternatives or consequences.
5. Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of individuals, institutions, or ideas. It reports scientific uncertainty neutrally (e.g., "The researchers don’t know exactly when this happened").
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – Descriptions are measured (e.g., "a violent collision," "chaotically") and based on research findings without hyperbolic or downplayed claims.
7. Flag-Waving – No – No appeals to patriotism, group identity, or loyalty are present.
8. Loaded Language – No – Language is neutral and technical (e.g., "excited rotational state," "non-principal axis rotation"). No emotionally charged words or stereotypes are used.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – No association of ideas with hated groups to discredit them.
10. Bandwagon – No – Popularity of the idea is not cited as evidence (e.g., no "many scientists agree").
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The collision is presented as a *probable* cause, but complexity is acknowledged (e.g., "It's hard to know if it was during planet formation or after").
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanations are clear and specific (e.g., brightness changes used to model spin). Terms like "tumbling" are defined.
13. Appeal to authority – No – References to scientists (Fraser) and *Nature Astronomy* provide context, but their authority is not used as the *primary* evidence to shut down debate. Findings are described objectively.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – Multiple possibilities are acknowledged (e.g., collision timing), with no false dichotomies.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – No simplistic phrases halt discussion (e.g., "it is what it is"). Instead, questions are posed ("hard to know," "can’t get a high-resolution image").
16. Red herring – No – All content is relevant to 'Oumuamua’s spin and collision history. No irrelevant distractions.
17. Straw men – No – No misrepresented arguments are refuted.
18. Whataboutism – No – No accusations of hypocrisy or deflection to other issues.

**Verdict – 0% –**  
The text is a straightforward scientific news report. It neutrally presents research findings about 'Oumuamua’s rotational state, citing observable evidence (brightness changes), peer-reviewed publication (*Nature Astronomy*), and direct quotes from researchers. It openly acknowledges limitations (e.g., inability to image the object) and avoids persuasive language, emotional appeals, bias, or ideological framing. The purpose is informative, not manipulative, aligning with science communication rather than propaganda.
