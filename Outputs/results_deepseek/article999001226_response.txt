Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "corrupt voting practices" (Labels Snipes' actions with an insulting term implying criminality).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" (Repeated verbatim three times consecutively).
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, brief, memorable phrase promoting the core message is used.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "before more people end up dead in Broward County over their corrupt voting practices" (Uses the threat of death to support the call for immediate arrest).
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Why she wasn't fired a long time ago is beyond anyone's ability to answer" (Questions the credibility of her past tenure and those who kept her in office).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "crimes against the people of Broward County" (Exaggerates the nature of the alleged election misconduct to the level of major crimes against the populace).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No appeal to patriotism, national/state identity, or loyalty is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "fiasco", "botched", "blistering criticism", "illegally destroyed", "corrupt", "crimes against the people" (Uses emotionally charged words with strong negative connotations to evoke anger and condemnation).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis or other universally hated groups is present.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text does not explicitly state or imply that the viewpoint is popular or that the reader should join a majority.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames Snipes personally for the complex election issues ("amid what is clearly voter fraud that she oversaw", "the fiasco she has created"), simplifying the causes of problems like recount delays and ballot issues solely to her actions/inaction.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The accusations are stated directly and specifically (e.g., "illegally destroyed ballots", "allowed illegal aliens, non-citizens and felons to vote", "ignored a court order").
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Breitbart, Marco Rubio, and the affidavit of Chelsey Smith as evidence supporting the fraud claims ("According to Breitbart, she illegally destroyed ballots", "Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), pointed out that voter fraud", "Chelsey Smith, signed an affidavit affirming that she had seen members of Snipes' staff engaging in voter fraud").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as purely corrupt vs. innocent, implying Snipes is solely responsible for fraud and must be arrested, dismissing other factors or perspectives (e.g., "a Democrat attorney says that doing so has nothing to do with fraud or corruption" is dismissed without consideration).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "crimes against the people of Broward County" (Shuts down discussion by framing the alleged actions as inherently criminal and beyond debate, invoking a powerful, emotionally charged label).
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The entire poll section about Jim Acosta ("take our poll - story continues below Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?...") is completely irrelevant to the story about Brenda Snipes and voter fraud in Broward County.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attributes specific actions to Snipes (destroying ballots, allowing ineligible voters, missing deadlines) and refutes a specific defense offered ("a Democrat attorney says that doing so has nothing to do with fraud or corruption"). It doesn't attack a misrepresented argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text focuses on Snipes and Broward County Democrats. It does not deflect criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy on unrelated issues.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of recognized propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on **Name Calling**, **Loaded Language**, and **Appeal to Fear** to vilify Brenda Snipes and frame her actions as inherently criminal ("corrupt", "fiasco", "crimes against the people", threat of death). **Causal Oversimplification** places sole blame on her for complex election issues. **Repetition** (of the Acosta poll) and a **Red Herring** distract from the main topic. **Appeal to Authority** (Breitbart, Rubio, Smith) is used selectively to support the fraud narrative while dismissing counter-evidence (the Democrat attorney). **Doubt** is cast on her entire tenure, and a **Black & White Fallacy** presents the situation without nuance. **Thought-Terminating Clichés** ("crimes against the people") shut down critical analysis. The overall purpose is not to inform neutrally but to aggressively persuade the reader that Snipes is guilty of severe misconduct and must be arrested immediately, using emotionally manipulative and one-sided techniques characteristic of propaganda. The inclusion of an irrelevant poll and permission notice further suggests a platform focused on persuasion rather than objective reporting.
