Name calling – No – The text criticizes the “official story” by calling it a “pathetic attempt at a cover-up,” but it does not attack a specific person or group with an insulting label.

Repetition – Yes – The core idea that helicopters were involved in the attack is repeated throughout the text, reinforced with each new piece of "evidence" presented. Example: "has once again ignited the theory that helicopters were used during the horrific attack," and "multiple other videos taken on the night of the attack also seem to point to helicopters being used."

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as a rallying cry or slogan.

Appeal to fear – No – While the subject matter (a massacre) is frightening, the text does not use fear to argue for its point over alternatives. It focuses on creating doubt and suspicion, not fear.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to create doubt about the official narrative and the investigation. Example: "the owner of the camera was never approached by the FBI, who have so far never seen the footage, much less investigated it."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text makes an exaggerated claim about the certainty of its conclusion. Example: "the fact remains that the official story has been proven, time and time again, to be absolutely false".

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make any appeals to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the reader. Example: "horrific attack," "massacre," "pathetic attempt at a cover-up."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests the theory is popular and therefore more credible. Example: "multiple videos have been released that many believe show helicopters either conducting an attack on the Vegas Strip or attempting to stop those that were".

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simplified cause for an observation to support its theory. Example: "You can see a large amount of wind and debris, apparently that is due to a helicopter hovering overhead." This assumes a helicopter is the only possible cause for wind and debris.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague and non-committal language to make suggestions without making firm claims. Example: "captured what seems to show a “large amount” of wind and debris," and "possibly from a helicopter hovering in place."

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites various sources as authorities to lend credibility to its claims. Example: "The tape was given to Fox News by an attorney who represents several shooting victims." and "As Shepard Ambellas reported for Intellihub..."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as having only two possibilities: the official story or the conspiracy theory. Example: "the fact remains that the official story has been proven, time and time again, to be absolutely false and in fact nothing more than a pathetic attempt at a cover-up."

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion.

Red herring – No – The text stays focused on its central claim about helicopters and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the reader.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent and then refute an opponent's argument. It directly attacks the "official story" as being false.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge any opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, unsubstantiated conspiracy theory by discrediting the official account of the Las Vegas shooting. It employs a wide array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal, including a strong reliance on creating Doubt about the official investigation, appealing to alternative 'authorities' (Tucker Carlson, Intellihub, an unnamed attorney), using emotionally Loaded Language ("horrific," "pathetic cover-up"), and presenting a Black & White Fallacy where the only alternative to the "absolutely false" official story is its own theory. The use of Repetition, Bandwagon ("many believe"), and intentional Vagueness ("seems to show") further reinforces the message while avoiding direct, falsifiable claims. The cumulative effect of these techniques is a highly persuasive piece designed to manipulate the reader's perception of the event rather than present objective facts.
