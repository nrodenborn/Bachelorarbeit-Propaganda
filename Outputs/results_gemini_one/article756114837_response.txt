6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The article focuses on the most extreme possibilities, such as the headline “WHO Prepares For ‘Worst Case’,” and highlights historical outbreaks with the highest fatality rates (e.g., “90% of those infected died”), which exaggerates the potential threat of the current situation.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The article discusses an international health crisis and does not appeal to the patriotism or national identity of any specific country.

Verdict – 75% – The article, while reporting on a real event with factual data from credible sources, heavily employs propaganda techniques to frame the narrative. The primary goal is not just to inform, but to generate alarm and a sense of impending crisis. This is achieved through a strong Appeal to Fear, focusing on the “worst case scenario” and high historical death tolls (Exaggeration). It uses Loaded Language (“deadly,” “decimated”) to heighten the emotional impact and an Appeal to Authority (WHO, Red Cross) to give these claims legitimacy. Finally, it uses a Bandwagon approach by listing all the countries taking action, creating a sense that a global panic is underway. While based on facts, the selection, framing, and language are deliberately crafted to provoke a specific emotional response, which is a hallmark of propaganda.
