Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to describe the location, such as "filthy compound," "wretched compound," and "horrid compound," which attacks the setting and by extension the people living there.

Repetition – Yes – The article repeatedly emphasizes the police's delay and the couple's frustration. The couple's view is quoted twice with similar phrasing: "They were dragging their feet. They were taking too long," and later, "We are just beyond frustrated that they took so long."

Slogans – No – The text is a news report and does not use any brief, memorable phrases as slogans to promote an idea.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by describing the scene with "weapons and rounds of ammunition" surrounding "11 starving children," and by mentioning the father wanted to perform an "exorcism" on his son.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is framed to question the credibility and competence of the police. The headline, "Couple question why police waited so long," and quotes like, "the Badgers said that police did not do a thorough job searching the property," directly cast doubt on the official response.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The technique is present in a quote from the boy's mother, who minimizes the claim of an "exorcism" by calling it a "translation issue" and stating the father "just wanted to pray for Abdul-Ghani to get better."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make any appeals to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The article uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's perception, such as "filthy," "wretched," "horrid," "horrifying scene," and "starving children."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or any other hated group.

Bandwagon – No – The article does not suggest that an idea is true or should be supported because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The technique is used in a quote from Tanya Badger: "They were dragging their feet. They were taking too long." This simplifies the complex legal issue of needing "probable cause" for a search into a simple accusation of negligence.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article attempts to provide clarity rather than be vague, for example by explaining the difference between an "exorcism" and a "ruqya" and by noting where information is not yet clear.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The article uses statements from authorities, such as Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe, as evidence for the facts it presents. For example, his quote, "I had no probable cause to go onto this property," is used as the official reason for the delay.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The narrative is primarily framed as a two-sided conflict: the couple who believe the police were negligent versus the police who claim they were following the law. This presents only two options, overlooking other potential complexities or factors in the situation.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The quote, "a child's life is at stake," is used to shut down debate over the complexities of police procedure by appealing to a higher moral imperative that discourages critical discussion of the legal constraints.

Red herring – No – The text does not introduce irrelevant information to distract from the main issue. Details like the traffic stop in Alabama provide relevant background context.

Straw men – No – The article does not misrepresent an argument in order to refute it. It presents the criticism against the police and then the police's direct response to that criticism.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain any instances of a person deflecting criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 70% – The text, while presented as a news report, heavily utilizes propaganda techniques to frame a specific narrative and elicit an emotional response from the reader. The article's entire structure, beginning with the headline, is designed to cast doubt on the actions of the police. It employs a significant amount of loaded language ("wretched," "horrifying," "starving") and appeals to fear to create a sense of outrage and urgency. The conflict is simplified into a black and white fallacy (negligent couple vs. by-the-book police), and a thought-terminating cliché ("a child's life is at stake") is used to dismiss the complexities of the law. While it does present the official police explanation (an appeal to authority), the narrative weight is clearly on the side of the critics. This moves the article from objective reporting into the realm of persuasive writing that aims to shape public opinion against the authorities, making it highly propagandistic in its effect and construction.
