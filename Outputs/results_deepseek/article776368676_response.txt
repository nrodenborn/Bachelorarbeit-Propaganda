Here is the analysis of the propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "rigged witch hunt", "17 angry Democrats", "disgrace to USA", "conflicted Mueller", "deep state coo [coup] attempt".
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – "Rigged Witch Hunt" is repeated multiple times (in the headline, quotes, and commentary).
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – "Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!" acts as a brief, memorable phrase encapsulating the demand.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "...before it continues to stain our country any further." Warns of negative national consequences to instill fear about allowing the investigation to continue.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "Bob Mueller is totally conflicted", "Mueller is going to protect these guys", "Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity". Directly questions Mueller's credibility and motives.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "Rigged Witch Hunt", "deep state coup attempt", "stain our country" are strong exaggerations of the nature and impact of the investigation. Minimization is less direct but implied by dismissing the investigation as illegitimate.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "...stain our country...", "disgrace to USA", "stop the will of We the People!!!". Appeals directly to patriotism and national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Rigged Witch Hunt", "angry Democrats", "dirty work", "disgrace", "stain our country", "terrible situation", "deep state coup attempt", "Lock them all up". These phrases carry strong negative connotations and emotional weight.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No examples found linking the investigation or its supporters to universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "And Trump is far from the only American who sees the investigation as a witch hunt. Many Twitter users have taken his side..." Appeals to the idea that this view is popular.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Implied throughout. The complex investigation into Russian interference and obstruction is reduced to simply being a "Rigged Witch Hunt" orchestrated by conflicted Mueller and "angry Democrats" due to political bias.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is direct and accusatory, not deliberately vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – "Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation.” ALAN DERSHOWITZ". Trump cites Dershowitz (a legal scholar) to lend credibility to his attack on Mueller.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The investigation is portrayed solely as a malicious, politically driven "witch hunt" ("rigged", "stain", "disgrace") with no legitimate purpose or basis. The alternative view (a legitimate investigation) is dismissed as a "conspiracy theory".
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Rigged Witch Hunt" itself functions as one, shutting down critical analysis of the investigation. "Enough is enough!!!" is another example discouraging further discussion.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introducing the specific case of Peter Strzok ("FBI Agent Peter Strzok... He was out to STOP THE ELECTION...") distracts from the broader investigation's legitimacy and Trump's call to end it.
17. **Straw men** – No – While the investigation is mischaracterized, the text doesn't explicitly refute an argument that wasn't presented. It attacks the investigation *as portrayed* by Trump.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – While mentioning "17 angry Democrats" implies bias, it doesn't explicitly charge opponents investigating Trump with hypocrisy regarding past investigations or actions.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It primarily consists of Donald Trump's tweets and supportive commentary that heavily utilize numerous propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Bandwagon, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-Terminating Clichés, Red Herring) to delegitimize the Mueller investigation, frame it as a partisan attack, and rally support for ending it. While the text includes brief contextual elements (Sessions' recusal, Giuliani/Sekulow's clarification, Leahy's obstruction concern), these are presented neutrally and are vastly outweighed by the propagandistic core message attacking the investigation. The primary purpose of the text, especially the quoted tweets and the supportive tweet from "Comfortably Smug," is to persuade the audience to adopt Trump's viewpoint using emotionally charged language and manipulative techniques rather than providing a balanced factual analysis. The sheer density and variety of propaganda techniques employed make it highly likely this is propaganda.
