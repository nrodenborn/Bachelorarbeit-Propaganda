Verdict – 80% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and straw men. These techniques are used to discredit Garry Wills' interpretation of the Qur’an and to promote a narrative that the Qur’an inherently supports violence and terrorism. The presence of these techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is propaganda, as it seeks to persuade the audience through emotional and rhetorical means rather than objective analysis.
