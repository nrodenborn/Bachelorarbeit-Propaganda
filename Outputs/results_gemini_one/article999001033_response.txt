Name calling – Yes – The text quotes a campaign staffer, Omar Smith, referring to Florida as a "cracker state," which is an insulting racial label for white people. It also quotes him defining Gillum's political beliefs as "part of the crazy crazy crazies."

Repetition – Yes – The core message that the Gillum campaign is "lying to voters" is stated in the headline, repeated in the first paragraph, and paraphrased by James O'Keefe at the end ("a candidate lying to the voters he needs to win the election").

Slogans – Yes – The text highlights a cynical phrase used by the staffer: "Remember our saying, modern-day fairy tales start with ‘once I am elected.'"

Appeal to fear – No – The text does not primarily build its case by instilling fear of what might happen if Gillum is elected; rather, it focuses on generating outrage and distrust based on his campaign's alleged current actions and statements.

Doubt – Yes – The entire purpose of the text is to question the credibility and honesty of Andrew Gillum. The headline "admits campaign is lying to voters" and the final rhetorical questions ("Will there be wall-to-wall coverage...") are designed to create doubt about both the candidate and the media.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The staffer is quoted using the exaggerated, absolute phrase "that will never happen" multiple times when discussing Gillum's platform promises.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use appeals to patriotism or national identity to make its point.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases such as "racist statements," "racial slur," "damaging footage," and "eviscerating Gillum" to create a negative emotional response in the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The article does not suggest that an idea is correct because it is popular or that many people are turning against the candidate.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The staffer's reasoning for why Gillum's platform promises won't pass is reduced to a single cause: "The reason being, the legislature that write the bills is all Republican-controlled." This simplifies the complex realities of the legislative process.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and specific in its claims, using direct quotes to support its argument rather than relying on vague language.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents "Project Veritas Action President James O’Keefe" as an authority figure who validates the findings, stating, "What we found...was just what we found in Missouri, Tennessee and Arizona." It also treats the "video evidence" itself as an unquestionable authority.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The article presents the situation in binary terms: Gillum is either completely honest or a complete liar. The staffer's comments are presented as definitive proof that the entire campaign is a fraud, leaving no room for nuance such as aspirational goals versus concrete promises.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases intended to shut down discussion; it aims to provoke a specific line of thought and outrage.

Red herring – No – The article stays focused on its central topic—the alleged dishonesty of the Gillum campaign—and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the reader.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent an opponent's argument in order to refute it. It presents its own accusations based on the video.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism of a subject by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – This text is a clear example of propaganda. It originates from Project Veritas, an organization known for producing politically motivated content with a specific agenda. The article's primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the audience to view the Democratic candidate, Andrew Gillum, as dishonest, racist, and unfit for office, particularly right before an election. It achieves this by selectively presenting secretly recorded and edited video clips, framed with loaded language ("racist statements," "damaging footage") to elicit an emotional response of outrage. The piece heavily employs numerous propaganda techniques, including name-calling, repetition of a central accusation, casting doubt, and appealing to its own authority (James O'Keefe and the "video evidence"). It presents a black-and-white fallacy where the candidate is portrayed as a complete liar, ignoring any political nuance. An objective news report would seek comment from the Gillum campaign for a response or rebuttal, provide context about Project Veritas's methods and political leanings, and avoid such emotionally charged framing. This text does none of those things, making its function as a persuasive, one-sided political attack—the essence of propaganda—unequivocal.
