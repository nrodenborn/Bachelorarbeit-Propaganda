Verdict – 70% – The text is a news article reporting on political statements, and these statements are rich with propaganda techniques. The article itself amplifies these techniques through its structure. The core message is built on **Repetition** of the **Slogan** "Release the Mueller report." The article's primary function is to showcase the **Bandwagon** effect, listing numerous high-profile candidates who are all making the same demand. This is reinforced with **Loaded Language** ("deserve to know," "right to know") and direct appeals to patriotism (**Flag-Waving**). While the article is framed as objective reporting, its content is a collection of one-sided political messaging, and its structure serves to strengthen the force of that messaging, making it a significant vehicle for propaganda.
