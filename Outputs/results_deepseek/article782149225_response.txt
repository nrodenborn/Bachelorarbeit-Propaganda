Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "filthy Jewish entity", "heretic regimes", "deluded fanatic".
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrase used to encapsulate the main message beyond quotes from Khecharem.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text warns that jihadis act "without any letup, pause, period of coexistence..." implying an imminent, unrelenting threat, and highlights the lack of Muslim opposition, suggesting vulnerability ("Western authorities should be pondering his words, and their implications, very carefully").
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – Questions the credibility/sincerity of Islamic condemnations ("Islamic groups in the West issue pro-forma condemnations... but are doing little or nothing") and questions the authorities' assessment ("dismissed him as an ‘extremist.’").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes the existence or impact of mainstream Muslim opposition to jihad ("there never appears any force of Muslims to oppose them", "there has never been in Islamic history an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad", "no mosque or Islamic school in the United States that teaches... why they should reject" jihadist views). Exaggerates the uniformity of historical Islamic practice ("mainstream, normative Islam").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – While the text defends Western nations and criticizes threats to them, it doesn't explicitly appeal to patriotism or national identity as a core argument technique.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Uses highly charged, emotional, and negative language: "filthy Jewish entity", "deluded fanatic", "heretic regimes", "relentless jihad warfare", "subjugating them", "denying them basic rights", "distressingly widespread".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt to link ideas to Hitler or Nazis to discredit them.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not argue that something should be believed or done because it's popular.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes the root cause of complex geopolitical issues (conflict, desire for conquest) simplistically to the abandonment of "the laws of Allah" ("After the laws of Allah were abandoned... the most important thing to do is to restore the rule of the Muslims").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is generally direct and explicit in its claims and accusations.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites the author's own book ("As I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS") and MEMRI ("According to the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI)") as authoritative sources supporting the narrative.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents the view that Islam historically and currently is fundamentally defined by jihad conquest, with no significant moderate opposition ("there has never been... an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad", "no mosque or Islamic school... teaches... why they should reject"). Implies the choice is between accepting this view or being dangerously naive.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Uses phrases like "mainstream, normative Islam" and "the great caliphates of history... all waged relentless jihad warfare" to shut down debate about the diversity of Islamic interpretation or history. Also, framing opposition as merely "pro-forma condemnations" dismisses it without consideration.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The entire section about Brett Kavanaugh ("take our poll... Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed...") is completely irrelevant to the main topic of the article (Khecharem's speech, the caliphate, jihad) and serves to distract the reader.
17. **Straw men** – No – The arguments refuted (e.g., jihad being the work of a "tiny minority of extremists", authorities dismissing Khecharem as an "extremist") are positions actually held by others and presented accurately for refutation.
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – The text charges its ideological opponents with hypocrisy regarding accusations of bigotry: "If Said Khecharem were a non-Muslim saying that Muslims needed to destroy ‘the filthy Jewish entity’... he would be accused of ‘Islamophobia’ and ‘bigotry.’ But no one will take any particular notice of this."

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs a significant number of defined propaganda techniques (Name calling, Repetition, Appeal to fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/minimization, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to authority, Black & white fallacy, Thought-terminating clichés, Red herring, Whataboutism) to advance a specific, highly negative narrative about Islam, jihad, and Muslim intentions. The core message relies heavily on selectively quoted sources (Khecharem, MEMRI), the author's own cited work presented as definitive authority, emotional manipulation (fear, disgust), oversimplification of complex history and theology, and the dismissal of counter-arguments. The irrelevant Kavanaugh poll further suggests an intent to manipulate audience engagement or perception beyond the core argument. While presenting factual elements (Khecharem's speech, Hizb ut-Tahrir's existence), the framing, language, argumentation techniques, and omissions strongly align with the purpose of promoting a particular ideological viewpoint and eliciting a specific emotional response (alarm, distrust) rather than offering a balanced analysis.
