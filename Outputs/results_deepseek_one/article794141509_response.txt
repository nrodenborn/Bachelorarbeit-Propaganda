Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Labels opponents as "those who hate freedom".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: Repeats "purge," "coordinated," and "silence" throughout the text (e.g., "coordinated effort," "alternative media purge," "silence people").
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses phrases like "free thought," "truth is treason," and "question the status quo" as memorable rallying cries.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Instills fear with warnings of "brainwashing," loss of freedom, silenced dissent, "unfettered access to the minds of 2 billion people," and claims this "should terrify everyone" and "scare the crap out of you".
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Questions Facebook's stated reason for the purge ("The reason given doesn’t really add up," "But this isn’t actually what their spam policy says").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggerates the impact ("biggest campaign against freedom of speech," "free thought goes to die," "brainwashing," "unfettered access to the minds of 2 billion people," "doomed"). Minimizes the platforms' stated reasons (spam/inauthentic behavior).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to patriotism/freedom ideals ("everyone who wants to be free," "freedom of speech," "First Amendment," "truth is treason in an empire of lies").
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged words: "TERRIFY," "purge," "silence," "hate freedom," "monopoly," "assault," "brainwashing," "doomed," "unfettered," "scare the crap out of you," "lies," "treason," "corruption," "oppressed".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Explanation: Implicitly compares the situation to Nazi collaboration by referencing "Vichy journalism" in the context of media collaboration.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Explanation: Highlights the popularity of the purged pages ("2.1 million fans," "3.1 million fans," etc.) and implies the purge is an attack on popular dissent ("silence large swaths of the population").
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Attributes the purge solely to a desire to silence dissent and control information ("one more step toward a monopoly on information," "coordinated effort to silence," "affect the outcome of the coming elections"), ignoring or dismissing the platforms' stated reasons (spam/inauthentic behavior).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is generally direct in its accusations and claims, though terms like "those who hate freedom" and "the establishment" are broad. The primary arguments are stated clearly, not obscured.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Cites Ron Paul ("truth is treason," "libertarian voice of reason") and quotes alternative journalists (John Vibes, Nicholas Bernabe) to support its narrative.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents a dichotomy: either support alternative media/social media freedom or accept brainwashing, loss of freedom, and control by evil forces ("those who hate freedom"). Framed as truth vs. lies, freedom vs. control.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses phrases like "truth is treason," "empire of lies," "brainwashing," and "free thought goes to die" to shut down critical examination of the opposing viewpoint or the platforms' reasoning.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: Introduces the Google document leak ("The Good Censor") and the number of Google searches ("2 trillion per day") to shift focus and amplify fear about censorship, even though the core event is the Facebook/Twitter purge.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: Misrepresents the opposition's position. Portrays Facebook/Twitter/Google as acting solely to suppress dissent for ideological reasons ("hate freedom," "support socialism, gun control, and the end of privacy," "working hand in glove with the government"), ignoring their stated policies and justifications.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Explanation: Charges corporate media (like the Washington Post) with hypocrisy for also "push[ing] political messages for profit," implying their criticism of the purged pages is invalid because they do the same thing.

**Verdict – 95% – Explanation:** The text exhibits an overwhelming majority (16 out of 18) of the defined propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is not balanced reporting but to persuade through intense fear-mongering ("TERRIFY," "brainwashing," "doomed"), loaded language, demonization of opponents ("those who hate freedom"), appeals to freedom/patriotism, oversimplification of causes, repetition of key alarming terms, bandwagon appeals based on follower counts, use of authorities within its ideological sphere, and presenting a stark, us-vs-them worldview. While it reports on an event (the removal of pages), the framing, selective emphasis, dismissal of counter-arguments, and consistent use of manipulative rhetorical devices clearly mark it as propaganda designed to provoke outrage, fear, and specific action (supporting alternative media/sites), rather than to provide a neutral analysis. The absence of substantive engagement with the platforms' detailed spam/inauthentic behavior policies further indicates its persuasive intent over informational.
