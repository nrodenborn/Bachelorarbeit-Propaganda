Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text attacks subjects with insulting labels, such as calling the Iranian government a “fascist theocracy,” Obama’s policies “pusillanimous,” and his supporters “obsequious acolytes.”
2.  Repetition – Yes – The core message that Obama's policies were weak and based on appeasement while Trump's are strong and effective is repeated throughout the text using different phrasing and examples, such as contrasting Obama's "fecklessness through appeasement" with Trump being a "new sheriff in town."
3.  Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases like contrasting the “tried and true concept of peace through strength” with “fecklessness through appeasement,” and describing Trump as the “new sheriff in town.”
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text supports Trump's policies by instilling fear about Obama's, stating that Obama’s approach “severely compromised America’s national security and weakened its image on the international stage.”
5.  Doubt – Yes – The text constantly questions the credibility and judgment of the Obama administration, for example, by stating Obama “seemed to be in a perpetual state of confusion about who his friends and enemies were.”
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates Obama's actions by stating that to secure the Iran deal, he “sold everything including the kitchen sink,” and minimizes the complexity of the situation by attributing the change in Iran's behavior solely to Trump.
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue around American strength and security, with phrases like “America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom” and concerns for “America’s national security.”
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with words designed to evoke emotion, such as describing Obama’s policies as “pusillanimous” and his interactions with Iran as “groveling,” while labeling the Iranian government as a “corrupt dictatorship.”
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of the Iranian government by associating it with a hated ideology, labeling it a “fascist theocracy.”
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is good because it is popular. It argues for the policy's effectiveness, not its popularity.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text assumes a simple cause for a complex event by stating that “the IRGC’s new docile posture in the Arabian Gulf is a direct consequence of this realization” (that Trump is a “new sheriff in town”), ignoring other potential geopolitical factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not deliberately unclear or vague; its message and accusations are direct and forcefully stated.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the Navy as an authority to establish the premise of its argument, stating, “But according to the Navy, the past five months have witnessed markedly less belligerent conduct from the Iranians.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: Obama’s “fecklessness through appeasement” which failed, and Trump’s “peace through strength” which is succeeding. It ignores any other potential policies or nuances.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like “there’s a new sheriff in town” to offer a simple, final-sounding explanation that discourages deeper analysis of the complex geopolitical situation.
16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central topic of comparing the Iran policies of the Trump and Obama administrations and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified version of the Obama administration's rationale for the Iran deal, claiming it was based on the “naïve notion that there were moderate elements of import in the Iranian government,” which is an oversimplification of the actual strategic arguments made for the deal.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text is a direct attack on a previous administration's policies, not a deflection of criticism against the current one. It is not responding to a charge of hypocrisy by pointing out the hypocrisy of an opponent.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or present a balanced analysis, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly biased viewpoint. It achieves this by employing a vast majority of the propaganda techniques listed.

The entire piece is built on a foundation of logical fallacies, most notably **Causal Oversimplification** (the "Trump Effect" is the sole reason for a change in Iranian behavior) and the **Black & White Fallacy** (presenting Obama's "weak" approach versus Trump's "strong" approach as the only two possibilities).

This framework is then heavily reinforced with emotional manipulation through constant **Name Calling** (“pusillanimous,” “despotic mullahs”), **Loaded Language** (“groveling,” “nefarious”), and **Appeals to Fear** (warning that Obama’s policies “severely compromised America’s national security”).

The argument systematically uses techniques like **Doubt** and **Straw Men** to dismantle the credibility of the previous administration while using **Flag-Waving** and **Slogans** (“peace through strength,” “new sheriff in town”) to build up the current one. While it references factual events (like the seizure of US sailors), it frames them within this intensely biased narrative, stripping them of context to serve its persuasive goal. The overwhelming use of these techniques in a coordinated manner to promote a political agenda at the expense of objective truth confirms its nature as propaganda.
