Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "malicious agenda", "wild claims", "social justice warrior-lawyers", "loon", "loonier", "fake emergencies".
2.  **Repetition – No** – The core message (Democrats delaying maliciously) is reinforced, but not repeated verbatim in a looping manner.
3.  **Slogans – No** – No brief, memorable phrases designed for rallying are used.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "If Kavanaugh isn’t in place... the Supreme Court will begin hearing cases... shorthanded." (Fear of an ineffective court). Also implied fear of Democrats taking control and blocking nominees if they win the Senate.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "never-credible accusations", "as weak and ridiculous as they are", "utter nonsense", "obviously unbalanced", "She may very well believe everything she’s saying, and that is one of the signs of lunacy, believing something that isn’t real." (All cast doubt on Ford's credibility/allegations).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – *Exaggeration*: "hurl the wild claims like a grenade", "blow up the process", "torpedo President Trump’s agenda". *Minimization*: "drunken groping" (minimizing the alleged assault).
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – While the Supreme Court and process are mentioned, there's no explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity to support the argument.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "malicious agenda", "deliberately refused", "wild claims", "grenade", "blow up", "game the system", "torpedo", "fake emergencies", "loon", "loonier", "unbalanced", "destroying herself". (Uses highly charged, emotional, and negative language).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No attempt to link opponents or ideas to universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – No appeal to the popularity of the idea that Kavanaugh should be confirmed.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Assumes the *sole* cause of the delay is a malicious Democratic strategy ("They deliberately refused...", "They wanted to hurl...", "lawyers... have an added incentive to drag...", "desire to delay proceedings"), ignoring other potential factors like procedural fairness, witness preparation, or genuine concern over the allegations.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is direct and accusatory, not vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Relies heavily on the statements of "former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova" presented as authoritative proof that the demand for an FBI probe is "utter nonsense" and Ford "doesn't want to testify".
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents the situation as purely malicious delay tactics by Democrats/Ford's team vs. the reasonable, rule-following actions of Republicans/Kavanaugh. Ignores complexities like investigation needs or witness concerns. Also frames the vote outcome solely depending on Collins/Murkowski facing "heavy pressure".
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – While loaded language is used, there are no specific clichés used explicitly to shut down discussion (e.g., "it is what it is", "America: love it or leave it").
16. **Red Herring – Yes** – The mention of "abortion rights groups concerned that Kavanaugh... might vote to restrict access to abortion" introduces an issue (judicial philosophy) irrelevant to the specific sexual assault allegations being discussed and the procedural delay tactics the article focuses on.
17. **Straw men – No** – The arguments attributed to Democrats/Ford (deliberate delay, lack of credibility) are central to the author's narrative and not clearly misrepresented weaker versions of actual arguments. The author *dismisses* their arguments but doesn't significantly *misrepresent* them beyond loaded language.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – No charges of hypocrisy against opponents (e.g., "What about when Republicans did X?").

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It heavily relies on multiple core propaganda techniques: **Name Calling** (incessantly attacking the credibility and motives of Democrats, Ford, and her lawyers), **Appeal to Fear** (dysfunctional court), **Doubt** (undermining Ford's allegations), **Exaggeration/Minimization** (inflammatory descriptions of actions vs. downplaying allegations), **Loaded Language** (pervasive use of emotionally charged, negative terms), **Causal Oversimplification** (attributing all delay solely to malicious intent), **Appeal to Authority** (using diGenova as definitive proof), **Black & White Fallacy** (good Republicans/rules vs. bad Democrats/chaos), and **Red Herring** (introducing abortion). The entire piece presents a highly biased, one-sided narrative designed not to inform objectively but to discredit one side, vilify individuals, and persuade the reader of a specific partisan viewpoint regarding the Kavanaugh confirmation battle. The tone is inflammatory, dismissive of opposing views, and relies heavily on emotional manipulation rather than balanced factual reporting.
