1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Judge Patti Saris as a "Kritarch," the asylum seekers as "illegal aliens," Indonesians as a "dull lot," and the Obama administration as the "Obama Regime."

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly refers to the asylum seekers as "illegal aliens," repeats the label "Kritarch" for the judge, and mentions the low IQ of Indonesians multiple times to reinforce the point.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the well-known political phrases "elections have consequences" and "build the wall."

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear of a breakdown in the legal system by suggesting "kritarchs who want to make American immigration policy" are overriding federal law and the will of the executive branch.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text consistently questions Judge Saris's credibility and competence, stating she "seems confused," "appears to be making up immigration law and procedure on the fly," and that her writing "makes no sense in English."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the judge's actions by claiming she has "gone full rogue." It minimizes the persecution by calling it a "short period in the 90s when there was a problem" and stating it was "limited in time and duration."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a defense of "the immigration laws of the United States" and the need to protect "American immigration policy" from an activist judge.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like "Kritarch," "pogrom," "dull lot," "credulous 'judges'," "inglorious end," and "full rogue" to evoke strong emotional reactions.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or Nazism.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular or that the reader should join a majority.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text claims Indonesia's stability is dependent on a "high IQ elite" to run the country, reducing a nation's complex socio-economic structure to a single factor (IQ).

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and blunt in its assertions and does not use intentionally vague language to confuse the reader.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents an unsourced IQ statistic ("87 is the average Indonesian IQ") as a fact to lend scientific authority to its claims. It also appeals to the authority of "Federal law" as an absolute to argue against the judge's decision.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between two extremes: either immediate deportation according to "the immigration laws" or a judge ("Kritarch") illegally making up her own policy. It ignores the legal possibility of reopening cases based on new circumstances.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase "elections have consequences" to shut down debate and imply that the Trump administration's policy is beyond question due to the election result.

16. Red herring – Yes – The extensive and repeated discussion of the supposed IQ of Indonesians and Chinese is irrelevant to the legal merits of an asylum case and serves only to distract and prejudice the reader against the groups involved.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument the judge never made, claiming she "wants these illegals to never leave." Her actual order was a temporary delay to allow the individuals to have their cases reviewed, not a permanent grant of residency.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. It employs a vast and overlapping array of propaganda techniques with high frequency. Its primary purpose is not to inform or present a reasoned legal analysis, but to persuade the reader by manipulating their emotions and bypassing critical thought. The piece is built on a foundation of **Name-calling** ("Kritarch," "illegal aliens") and **Loaded Language** to create a hostile emotional landscape. It systematically attacks the credibility of the judge through **Doubt** and **Exaggeration** ("full rogue") while building a **Straw Man** of her actual ruling. The argument introduces a highly prejudicial and irrelevant **Red Herring** (the lengthy discussion of IQ) and relies on **Causal Oversimplification** and a **Black & White Fallacy** to frame the complex legal issue as a simple battle between law and judicial tyranny. The sheer density and combination of these techniques confirm that the text is a deliberate work of propaganda.
