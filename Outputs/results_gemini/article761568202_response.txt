Verdict – 85% – The text itself is a news report, but it is reporting on statements from Bill Clinton that are heavily propagandistic. Clinton is not engaging in a frank discussion but is actively trying to shape public perception of a past event to his benefit. He does this by employing a significant number of propaganda techniques. The most prominent are Whataboutism and Red Herring, where he deflects from his own actions by bringing up allegations against Donald Trump. He also uses Causal Oversimplification to attribute the renewed interest in his scandal to a simple political frustration, ignoring broader cultural shifts. Furthermore, he uses Flag-Waving and Thought-Terminating Clichés (“I defended the Constitution”) to reframe his personal and political survival as a noble, patriotic act, thereby shutting down criticism. While the article includes balancing information from Monica Lewinsky, the core quotes from Clinton are a clear exercise in political propaganda aimed at image management.
