Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques used in the text "Geert Wilders Puts the Political Elites On Notice":

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Labels opponents as "political elites" and accuses them of "selling us out". Also implies they are authoritarian and support tyranny ("more authoritarian", "tyranny", "supporting the degeneration of Britain into a police state").
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: Repeats phrases like "No more!" and "Take notice" multiple times for emphasis ("No more!", "And that’s right: enough is enough", "Take notice, Theresa May. Take notice, Dutch Prime Minister Rutte. Take notice, Mrs. Merkel or President Macron.").
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses brief, memorable phrases like "No more!", "Enough is enough", "We will not be gagged anymore", "We will never surrender", "We will defend our civilization".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Instills fear about mass immigration, Islamization, becoming "foreigners in our own lands", the government becoming a tyrannical "authoritarian police state", the "death of Britain as a free society", and the sacrifice of girls to "diversity" and "multiculturalism".
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – Explanation: While critical, the text doesn't primarily frame arguments by explicitly questioning the credibility of specific opponents *as a technique* (e.g., "Can we trust X?"). It makes direct accusations instead.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggerates the scale and consequences of government actions (e.g., "death of Britain as a free society", "authoritarian police state", "degeneration of Britain", "massive, years-long cover-up", "sacrifice of thousands of British girls"). Minimizes potential complexities of immigration policy or the reasons for banning individuals.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to national/civilizational identity and patriotism: "We will defend our civilization", "we will protect our people", "we are the people", "our own lands", framing the struggle as defending Western civilization against external and internal threats.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged and stereotyping language throughout: "sold us out", "mass immigration", "Islamization", "jihad terror", "Sharia oppression", "Muslim rape gangs", "authoritarian", "tyranny", "cover-up", "sacrifice", "idols of 'diversity' and 'multiculturalism'", "totalitarianism", "degeneration", "police state".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not compare opponents or their policies to Nazis or Hitler.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to popularity and rising support: "thousands will rise up", "the future is ours", "we are the people", implying a growing, inevitable movement the reader should join.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents complex societal issues (immigration, integration, legal processes, counter-terrorism) as having simple, direct causes: government actions ("sold us out", "mass immigration", "open borders") directly lead to becoming "foreigners in our own lands". Imprisoning Tommy Robinson directly heralds the "death of Britain as a free society".
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is direct and accusatory, not deliberately vague or obscure. It makes specific claims (though often hyperbolic).
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: The text relies on Wilders' speech and the author's own assertions, not on citing external authorities for validation.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents stark choices with no middle ground: either support freeing Tommy Robinson/support Wilders' stance, or you are "supporting the degeneration of Britain into a police state". Also frames the situation as "free society" vs. "authoritarian police state"/"totalitarianism".
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses phrases like "sold us out", "defend our civilization", "protect our people", "the future is ours", "we are the people" which serve as rallying cries potentially discouraging deeper critical analysis of the claims.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on its core grievances (immigration, government actions, Tommy Robinson). While it provides examples (bannings, admitting preachers), these are used to support the main arguments, not introduce irrelevant distractions.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: Misrepresents the government's motivations. E.g., claims the intent of Tommy Robinson's imprisonment was a "massive, years-long cover-up" and to frighten critics "into silence", and that banning certain individuals is solely "for the crime of opposing jihad terror and Sharia oppression" or "telling the truth about Islam and jihad", ignoring potential legal or procedural reasons.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: While contrasting the banning of critics with the admission of extremist preachers, this is used as evidence of hypocrisy *within the government's actions* regarding free speech, rather than primarily charging an *opponent* with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

**Verdict – 95% – Explanation:** The text exhibits a very high concentration of recognized propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on **Appeal to Fear**, **Loaded Language**, **Exaggeration**, **Flag-Waving**, **Slogans**, **Repetition**, **Name Calling**, **Bandwagon**, **Causal Oversimplification**, **Black & White Fallacy**, **Straw Men**, and **Thought-terminating clichés**. Its primary purpose is not balanced reporting or nuanced argument, but to vilify opponents ("political elites"), evoke strong fear and anger in the audience about immigration and Islamization, rally support around Wilders and Robinson using simple, emotional slogans, and present a stark, us-vs-them narrative of defending civilization against an authoritarian government colluding with external threats. While it contains factual elements (e.g., specific bannings, quotes), these are selected, framed, and often exaggerated to serve this persuasive and emotionally manipulative purpose, overwhelmingly meeting the criteria of propaganda.
