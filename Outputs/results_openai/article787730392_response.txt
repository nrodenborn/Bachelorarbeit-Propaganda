Verdict – 70% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, such as repetition, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and whataboutism. These techniques are used to argue that the suspects are being treated unfairly due to racial and religious prejudice, which suggests a significant likelihood of the text being propaganda.
