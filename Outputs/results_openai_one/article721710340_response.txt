Verdict – 60% – The text contains several propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, exaggeration/minimization, flag-waving, loaded language, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These elements suggest a moderate likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it aims to persuade the audience to support ICE's actions by emphasizing threats, appealing to patriotism, and presenting a dichotomous choice. However, the text also provides factual details about the arrests, which balances the propagandistic elements to some extent.
