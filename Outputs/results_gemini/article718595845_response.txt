1. Name calling – Yes – The author accuses the Trump administration of a bid to "demonize Iran" and describes the U.S. foreign policy as a "schizophrenic approach."

2. Repetition – No – While the text focuses on a central theme, it does not repeat the same specific message or phrase over and over.

3. Slogans – No – The text is a long-form argument and does not use brief, memorable phrases as a substitute for that argument.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The author uses a quote from Scott Ritter to instill fear about the consequences of U.S. policy, warning what might happen when confronting "the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in North Korea and Iran today" if the U.S. military is unprepared.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is structured to create doubt about the credibility of the U.S. government's claims. For instance, it asks of Nikki Haley, "Did she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remarks, or fail to read the entire UN report? The world may never know."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author describes Nikki Haley's speech as "grandiose" and claims the administration wants to "demonize Iran at all costs," which are exaggerations of motive and presentation.

7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its case; it is, in fact, critical of U.S. national policy.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged language, such as "blatantly telling lies," "grandiose speech," "infamous performance," "hypocritical," and "trumped-up charges."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or similarly hated groups.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular.

11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text argues against what it presents as the U.S. government's oversimplification, offering a more complex explanation for the origin of the missiles.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague; it uses specific details and expert quotes to make its argument clear.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text's entire counter-argument is built upon the authority of experts like "former inspector Scott Ritter," "Common Dream’s Reza Marashi," and a "panel of U.N. experts."

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice between the U.S. government's "blatant lie" and the absolute truth of the experts it cites, without acknowledging potential nuances or alternative interpretations of the evidence.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to prevent critical thought; it builds a detailed, albeit one-sided, argument.

16. Red herring – Yes – The author introduces the U.S. arming of ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliates. This is an irrelevant point to the factual question of whether Iran supplied missiles to Yemen, and it serves to distract the reader by attacking the U.S.'s general credibility.

17. Straw men – No – The text quotes and addresses the specific claims made by Nikki Haley, attacking the actual argument presented rather than a distorted version.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text explicitly charges the U.S. with hypocrisy by asking why it is "singling out Iran" when the "U.S. [is] continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed ISIS." This is a direct attempt to discredit an opponent by pointing out their perceived hypocrisy on other issues.

***

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to provide a balanced and objective report, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly critical viewpoint of the U.S. government. The title itself, "The US Is Blatantly Telling Lies," immediately frames the piece as an attack rather than an impartial analysis.

The author employs a significant number of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. The argument is built on a foundation of **Doubt**, systematically attempting to dismantle the credibility of the U.S. government. This is supported by a heavy **Appeal to authority**, where selected experts are presented as the sole arbiters of truth. The narrative is framed as a **Black & white fallacy**: the U.S. is lying, while the author's sources are telling the complete truth.

Furthermore, the text uses emotionally manipulative tools like **Loaded Language** ("demonize," "schizophrenic," "infamous") and **Name calling** to shape the reader's perception of the actors involved. To deflect from the core issue of Iran's potential involvement, the author uses both a **Red herring** and **Whataboutism** by bringing up unrelated U.S. actions in the region (arming ISIS/al-Qaeda) to charge the U.S. with hypocrisy.

While the text presents detailed counter-claims that may have factual elements, the overwhelming use of these persuasive and manipulative techniques, its one-sided presentation, and its emotionally charged framing are all hallmarks of propaganda.
