Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, and loaded language. These elements suggest a strong likelihood of the text being propaganda, as they aim to influence the audience's perception of the Trump Administration's actions and discredit opposing viewpoints. However, not all propaganda techniques are present, and the text also contains factual information about the court ruling, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood.
