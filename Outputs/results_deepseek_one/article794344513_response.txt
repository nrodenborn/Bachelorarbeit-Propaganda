### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "tech giants", "plutocratic information-controlling establishment", "social media dinosaurs". These insulting labels attack social media companies and the establishment.  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated verbatim three times, emphasizing a distraction from the main topic.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "We will not be silenced" acts as a memorable, rallying phrase against censorship.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warns of corporate-state censorship ("wipe out independent media", "disappear you in the blink of an eye"), instilling fear about loss of free speech.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions Facebook’s credibility: "Facebook then suggested the real reason [...] pesky folks like the independent media have a way of reporting information [...] the mainstream tends to ignore."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates Facebook’s actions as a "purge" and "memory-holed," while minimizing their stated reasons ("this couldn’t be further from the truth").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to liberty and anti-censorship values: "independent, liberty-minded, antiwar media," "ideas of peace and freedom."  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotionally charged terms like "egregious," "coordinated attack," "neoconservative group," and "thorn in their side" evoke outrage.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Cites 6 million followers and 4.1-star ratings as proof of legitimacy: "Does Facebook think it knows better than the 6 million people who clicked like on our page?"  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes the purge solely to silencing dissent ("posed a threat to the mainstream"), ignoring Facebook’s complex policies.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are direct, not deliberately obscure.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Quotes Glenn Greenwald and Daniel McAdams to validate claims: "Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 12, 2018".  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Frames issue as free speech ("peace, bridging the divide") vs. censorship ("corporate-state censorship"), ignoring middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Phrases like "thorn in their side" and "paradigm of control" oversimplify and halt deeper analysis.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Distracts with the Nikki Haley poll and "Your News Wire" example to avoid addressing Facebook’s "inauthentic behavior" claims.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Misrepresents Facebook’s "inauthentic behavior" argument as merely silencing dissent: "this nonsense about tricking people was brought into play."  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Deflects criticism by citing "Your News Wire" remaining active: "pages like YNW have become famous for spreading lies [...] why they targeted us."

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely propaganda. It employs 13/18 identified techniques to advance a one-sided narrative against social media companies and the government. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded language, fear appeals, and flag-waving frame the purge as an existential threat to liberty.  
- **Fallacious reasoning**: Straw men, black/white fallacies, and whataboutism dismiss counterarguments without engagement.  
- **Persuasive framing**: Bandwagon appeals (6 million followers) and name-calling ("tech giants") polarize readers, while red herrings (Nikki Haley poll) distract.  
- **Agenda-driven**: The call to action (subscribing to alternative platforms) and consistent vilification of opponents suggest a goal to mobilize readers against perceived censorship.  
While it raises valid concerns about corporate-government ties, the text’s selective evidence, oversimplification of motives, and reliance on emotional rhetoric align it more closely with propaganda than balanced journalism. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges legitimate critiques of censorship but underscores the dominant propagandistic execution.
