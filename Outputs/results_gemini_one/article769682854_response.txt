1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes the assailant using insulting labels like “s--- n----!” and "b---- a-- motherf------". It also quotes a Facebook post that refers to the man as a "scum bag of the year.”
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat a specific message or phrase in the manner of this propaganda technique.
3. Slogans – Yes – The story is centered around the political slogan “Make America Great Again” on the teen's hat, and it also quotes the bar using the slogan “THIS BAR IS A SAFE SPACE FOR EVERYONE!”.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The article's core narrative about a teenager being physically assaulted for his political affiliation ("he was assaulted by a drink-throwing stranger... all because he was wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat") is intended to instill fear about the potential violent consequences of expressing certain political beliefs.
5. Doubt – No – The text does not actively seek to question the credibility of any person or institution.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – While the text quotes an exaggeration ("scum bag of the year"), the article itself does not appear to exaggerate or minimize the events it describes.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The conflict revolves around a “Make America Great Again” hat, a potent symbol of American patriotism for its supporters. The victim reinforces this by stating, "I support my President," directly appealing to a sense of national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases such as "assaulted," "shocked," and "ripped off," and includes quotes with graphic language to create a strong emotional reaction in the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text makes no comparisons to Nazis or similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text emphasizes that the video of the incident "has since gone viral" and "racked up more than two million views," appealing to the idea that a large number of people agree with the implicit condemnation of the attacker.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The article presents the reason for the attack as a simple, direct cause: "all because he was wearing a 'Make America Great Again' hat." This simplifies the complex political and social tensions that underlie such an event.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article uses statements from "San Antonio police," "Whataburger," and the assailant's employer ("Rumble bar") as authoritative sources to confirm the details of the story and condemn the action, thereby lending credibility to its narrative.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The narrative presents a stark contrast between the victim, who calmly says, “let’s have a conversation about it," and the violent attacker. This creates a simple binary of peaceful dialogue versus unprovoked aggression, ignoring any other nuances.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text quotes the bar's statement, "THIS BAR IS A SAFE SPACE FOR EVERYONE!", which is a modern cliché used to signal virtue and discourage further critical thought about the situation.
16. Red herring – No – The article remains focused on the central incident and its direct consequences.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not create or refute any arguments that were not actually part of the incident.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect blame or criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 85% – Although the text reports on a factual event, it is heavily slanted to function as propaganda. The article is framed to elicit a strong emotional response and promote a specific political viewpoint: that supporters of President Trump are innocent victims of unprovoked, violent attacks from their intolerant political opponents. This is achieved by employing numerous propaganda techniques, including loaded language ("assaulted"), appeal to fear, flag-waving (the MAGA hat), causal oversimplification ("all because he was wearing a... hat"), and a black & white fallacy that pits a peaceful, rational teenager against a vile, profane aggressor. The use of appeals to authority (police, corporate statements) and the bandwagon effect (the "viral" video) are marshaled to validate this one-sided narrative. A neutral news report would be more dispassionate and less reliant on these techniques to frame the story.
