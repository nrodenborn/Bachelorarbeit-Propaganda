**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict – 30% –** The text contains some elements of propaganda, particularly through the use of appeal to fear, exaggeration, loaded language, and appeal to authority. These techniques serve to heighten concern and urgency about the outbreak, potentially influencing the reader’s emotional response. However, the majority of the text is factual, cites reputable sources, and provides detailed information about the outbreak, symptoms, and responses. The primary intent appears to be informative rather than manipulative, but the emotional framing and language increase the likelihood of it being considered mild propaganda. Therefore, there is a moderate (30%) chance that the text qualifies as propaganda, mainly due to its sensational tone and emotional appeals rather than overt misinformation or manipulation.
