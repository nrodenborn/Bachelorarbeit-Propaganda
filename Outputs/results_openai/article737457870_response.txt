Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, repetition, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, and loaded language. These techniques are used to shape the reader's perception of the connections between Democratic figures and Louis Farrakhan, casting doubt on their credibility and minimizing their statements. The presence of these techniques suggests a moderate likelihood that the text is propaganda, as it appears to aim at influencing public opinion against certain political figures by highlighting their associations with a controversial figure. However, the absence of other techniques like appeal to fear, bandwagon, and black & white fallacy indicates that the text is not heavily reliant on propaganda methods.
