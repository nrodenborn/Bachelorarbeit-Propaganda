Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack Dina Habib Powell and others, such as calling her “McMaster’s Huma Abedin,” a “White House Leaker,” and part of “the swamp.” H.R. McMaster is labeled an “Islamic apologist.”

Repetition – Yes – The question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is repeated three times in a row to reinforce the message and engage the reader in the article's premise.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases like “part of the swamp” and “Never Trumpers” to categorize individuals and ideas in a simple, recognizable way.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that Powell’s appointment would be “devastating” and represents a return to the “failed incoherent foreign policy of the Obama era,” instilling fear in the reader about the consequences of her appointment.

Doubt – Yes – The text actively questions Powell’s credibility and loyalty by asking, “Is it any wonder Habib Powell was a major White House source of the negative leaks to the enemedia?” and by detailing her associations to suggest she is untrustworthy.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by stating, “Dina Powell is everything that was wrong with the Bush administration.” It also describes K.T. McFarland as “superb” to exaggerate the contrast with Powell.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific political identity and patriotism by framing the issue as a defense of President Trump’s agenda for the nation against internal enemies and by referring to “our ambassador to the U.N.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases designed to evoke a strong reaction, such as “devastating,” “swamp,” “Islamic apologist,” and “enemedia.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses the same logic by repeatedly associating Dina Habib Powell with individuals and groups the target audience is expected to hate, such as the Clintons, Huma Abedin, Valerie Jarrett, and “Muslim Brotherhood front groups,” to discredit her by association.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text creates an in-group appeal by stating, “Longtime Geller Report readers have suffered Powell for well over a decade,” encouraging new readers to join this established viewpoint.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies complex events, for example, by stating that McMaster simply “forced out” K.T. McFarland and “inserted” Dina Powell, ignoring the multifaceted reasons behind high-level staff changes in the White House.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague terms like “the swamp” and “Republican establishment” which are deliberately unclear and rely on the audience’s pre-existing negative feelings rather than on precise definitions.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text relies on the perceived authority of sources like Daniel Greenfield and Breitbart, quoting them extensively to support its claims against Powell.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy where individuals are either aligned with President Trump’s agenda (good) or are part of the “swamp” and support the “failed incoherent foreign policy of the Obama era” (bad), leaving no room for nuance or alternative perspectives.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like “part of the swamp” to dismiss Dina Habib Powell. This label is intended to end discussion and discourage critical thought about her actual qualifications or policy stances.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a long, irrelevant story at the end about an “Ambassador Nancy Powell” in Pakistan. This is a different person from Dina Habib Powell and serves only to distract the reader and create a negative association through the similar last name.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an oversimplified and likely inaccurate version of H.R. McMaster’s views, claiming he believed “Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam.” This creates a weak argument (a straw man) that is easy to knock down.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not use this technique. It is a direct attack on Dina Habib Powell and does not attempt to deflect criticism of another subject by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 100% – This text is an unambiguous piece of propaganda. It employs a vast and overlapping array of propaganda techniques (17 out of the 18 listed) with the clear, singular goal of discrediting Dina Habib Powell and preventing her potential appointment as UN Ambassador. The article makes no attempt at balanced journalism or objective analysis. Instead, it relies entirely on emotional manipulation and logical fallacies. Techniques like Name-calling (“swamp,” “Islamic apologist”), Loaded Language (“devastating,” “enemedia”), and Appeal to Fear create a hostile and urgent emotional tone. The argument is built not on facts about Powell’s performance, but on discrediting her through association (Reduction ad Hitlerum) with figures and groups hated by the target audience (Clintons, Obama, Huma Abedin). It uses Appeals to Authority (Breitbart, Daniel Greenfield) to lend its claims a veneer of credibility, while employing fallacies like Straw Men and Causal Oversimplification to distort the positions of its targets. The inclusion of a Red Herring at the end about a different person with the same last name is a particularly blatant attempt to mislead the reader. The text is not designed to inform, but to persuade and incite a specific political action based on a heavily biased and manipulative presentation of information.
