**3. Slogans – No –** There is no brief, memorable phrase used as a slogan.

**Verdict – 90% –**  
The text employs a large number of propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, intentional vagueness, black & white fallacy, and straw man arguments. These techniques work together to shape the reader’s perception of DREAMERs and undocumented immigrants in a negative light, while minimizing nuance and discouraging critical engagement with the complexities of immigration policy. The high frequency and variety of propaganda techniques indicate a strong likelihood (90%) that this text is propaganda, designed to influence opinion rather than present objective information.
