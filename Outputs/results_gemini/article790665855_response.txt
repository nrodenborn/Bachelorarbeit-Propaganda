1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Kavanaugh with insulting terms such as "constitution-hating," "tyrannical tendencies," and an "enemy of the Fourth Amendment."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the hashtag "#StoptheNDAA" which acts as a brief, memorable phrase to rally support for a cause.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns of a "Gestapo like police state" and that future court cases will be "detrimental in deciding how much freedom and privacy Americans get to keep," instilling fear about the consequences of Kavanaugh's confirmation.
5. Doubt – Yes – The headline "MSM Using Kavanaugh Sex Scandal to Distract You From Real Reason He Shouldn’t Be Confirmed" directly questions the media's motives and credibility.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by claiming the left is "calling for Kavanaugh to be executed" and minimizes the sexual misconduct allegations by framing them as a "great distraction."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and American identity by framing the argument around the defense of the Constitution, specifically the "Fourth Amendment," and the protection of "freedom and privacy Americans get to keep."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "mudslinging orgy," "kangaroo courts," and "Gestapo like police state" to evoke strong negative feelings.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text makes a comparison to a hated group by describing a potential outcome as a "Gestapo like police state."
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to popularity; instead, it argues that the important issue is one that "no one is talking about," positioning its viewpoint as an unpopular but correct one.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a single, simple reason for the focus on the sexual misconduct allegations: that the "MSM" is using it as a deliberate "distraction" from his judicial record, ignoring other complex political and social factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article is direct and specific in its central argument, citing particular court cases and judicial opinions to support its claims. It is not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites Senator Rand Paul, Representative Justin Amash, and Judge Andrew Napolitano as authorities to lend credibility to its argument against Kavanaugh.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a simplified political landscape where "the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed over the sex abuse allegations and the right is attacking the alleged victims," ignoring any moderate or alternative viewpoints.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "Long story short, #Kavanaugh is not a friend to civil liberties or the Constitution" is used to shut down further discussion and present a simplified conclusion as fact.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text includes a poll asking "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?", which is entirely unrelated to the article's subject of Brett Kavanaugh and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that was not being made by stating, "the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed over the sex abuse allegations." This is an extreme mischaracterization of the opposition's actual position.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes both the left and the right but does not attempt to deflect criticism of Kavanaugh by pointing out the alleged hypocrisy of his opponents. Its primary goal is to redirect the focus of the argument.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. While it presents a core argument supported by factual evidence (Kavanaugh's past rulings and statements), this evidence is wrapped in a dense layer of manipulative techniques designed to persuade the reader emotionally rather than intellectually. The article's entire premise, established in the headline, is a propaganda frame: that the mainstream media is creating a "distraction" to hide the "real" truth, a truth only the author can provide. It heavily employs loaded language ("Gestapo like police state," "mudslinging orgy"), name-calling ("constitution-hating"), and appeals to fear to create a sense of urgency and outrage. Furthermore, it uses straw man arguments ("left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed") and a black & white fallacy to caricature opposing views, making its own position seem more reasonable by comparison. The sheer volume and variety of propaganda techniques used (15 out of 18 analyzed) demonstrate that the article's primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to aggressively push a specific agenda and worldview.
