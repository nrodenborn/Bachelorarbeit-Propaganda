Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, appeal to authority, and red herring. These elements suggest a significant likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it aims to influence the reader's perception of the Awan family and their alleged activities through emotionally charged language and repeated negative framing. The presence of a poll unrelated to the main story further indicates an attempt to sway public opinion against Democratic politicians.
