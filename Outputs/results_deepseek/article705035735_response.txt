Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to the virus, officials, or alternatives. Descriptive terms like "deadly" and "highly fatal" are factual.
2.  **Repetition** – No – While "black death" is mentioned multiple times, it serves as a point of comparison for the Marburg outbreak within the narrative, not as a simple repetition of the same core message for emphasis.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to encapsulate the message (e.g., "Make America Great Again"). The headline is sensational but not a slogan repeated within the text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The headline "New Virus With NO CURE Spreading: This Is WORSE Than The ‘Black Death’" and statements like "fatality rate of almost 90%", "much more deadly than the black death", "highly fatal virus", "most virulent pathogens", "could spread rapidly into regions already devastated" are designed to instill significant fear about the Marburg virus.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The credibility of sources (WHO, Uganda's Ministry of Health) or the information itself is not questioned.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes (Exaggeration) – The headline claim "This Is WORSE Than The ‘Black Death’" is a significant exaggeration. While the Marburg virus has a higher *case fatality rate* (88-90%) than historical plague outbreaks (estimated 30-60% in medieval times), the Black Death killed an estimated 30-60% of *Europe's entire population* (tens of millions), making its overall societal impact vastly worse. Comparing them solely on CFR minimizes the scale of the plague.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity to support the message.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words and phrases like "NO CURE", "WORSE", "deadly", "highly fatal", "contagious", "decimated", "devastating", "devastated", "crisis point" are emotionally charged and evoke strong negative feelings (fear, dread).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No idea is disapproved of by associating it with a universally hated group.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or action to encourage acceptance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The origin (bat cave exposure via a game hunter) is presented as the likely cause, which is plausible and not overly simplified to the point of ignoring complexity. The text doesn't claim this is the *only* cause or oversimplify the outbreak dynamics.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text provides specific details: the virus name (Marburg), location (Kween district, eastern Uganda), date declared (October 19), number of cases (5), fatality rate (88-90%), transmission method, symptoms, involved organizations (WHO, Ugandan Ministry of Health), and origin hypothesis. It is not vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text frequently cites the World Health Organization (WHO) and Uganda's Ministry of Health to establish credibility and support the facts presented (e.g., "WHO has confirmed", "according to the World Health Organization", "The WHO website reads", "declared by the nation’s Ministry of Health", quotes Dr. Zabulon Yoti of WHO).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text does not present a complex situation as having only two possible choices or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking (e.g., "it is what it is", "trust the science" without context). The quote from Dr. Yoti encourages community engagement and understanding.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the Marburg outbreak. While the Madagascar plague outbreak is mentioned for context regarding resource strain, it is relevant background, not an irrelevant distraction from the main topic.
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented or weaker arguments are presented to be refuted.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are made against critics or alternative viewpoints.

**Verdict – 65% –** The text contains significant elements of propaganda, primarily through **Appeal to Fear** and **Loaded Language**, particularly in the highly sensationalized headline ("New Virus With NO CURE Spreading: This Is WORSE Than The ‘Black Death’") and the use of emotionally charged terms throughout. The headline's comparison to the Black Death is a clear **Exaggeration**. However, the core of the text relays factual information about a real health event (the Marburg outbreak in Uganda), citing credible sources like the WHO and Ugandan health authorities (**Appeal to Authority**). The presence of verifiable details (location, date, cases, symptoms, transmission) and the lack of most other propaganda techniques prevent it from being purely propaganda. The propaganda elements are layered onto a factual base to maximize alarm and attention.
