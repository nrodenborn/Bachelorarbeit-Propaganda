Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack opponents, such as the title "Avenatti’s Freak Show," and descriptions like "enraged Left," "creepy porn lawyer," and calling Avenatti a "con artist" and "total low-life."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly frames the accusations as a politically motivated, last-minute "character-assassination" attempt by the "enraged Left." It also explicitly mentions the concept: "...as they get aired over and over again in the 24-hour news cycle."

Slogans – Yes – The text quotes memorable phrases intended to rally support, such as Rush Limbaugh's warning to Republicans: "You can kiss the MIDTERMS goodbye if you don’t get highly qualified Kavanaugh approved."

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text quotes Newt Gingrich to instill fear in the audience: "And if the Left can stop Kavanaugh we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime on the Supreme Court."

Doubt – Yes – The text constantly questions the credibility of the accusers, for example, by stating, "odds are Ford is lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder such as false memory syndrome" and questioning why Swetnick would keep attending parties where she witnessed gang rapes.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the opposition's motives ("The Left’s frenzied, demagogic assault") while minimizing the allegations against Kavanaugh ("The case against confirming Kavanaugh may be somewhere between weak and non-existent").

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the identity of "Conservatives," urging them to view the events as a political assault on their values and on a key American institution, the Supreme Court.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases designed to create a negative impression of Kavanaugh's opponents, such as "Freak Show," "character-assassination," "enraged Left," and "frenzied, demagogic assault."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses the same principle by dismissing an idea by associating it with a group hated by the target audience: "Only left-wingers and feminists like Maureen Dowd still believe Hill..."

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that people should support Kavanaugh because he is popular. In fact, it cites a poll showing his unpopularity and blames it on a media campaign.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the multiple, complex allegations against Kavanaugh to a single, simple cause: a political plot by the "enraged Left" to stop his confirmation at all costs.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague or obscure; its point of view and accusations are very direct and clearly stated.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites figures of authority for its target audience, such as President Trump, Newt Gingrich, and Rush Limbaugh, to validate its position.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice. For example, it suggests Christine Blasey Ford is either "lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder," ignoring other possibilities. It also frames the confirmation as a choice between getting Kavanaugh on the court or never getting another conservative justice.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that oversimplify a complex situation to shut down discussion, such as the quote, "what we have to understand is this is about raw power," which dismisses the need to examine the specific allegations.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas case, then spends time discrediting Hill. This serves as a distraction from the specifics of the Kavanaugh allegations by trying to create a historical parallel of a supposedly false accusation.

Straw men – Yes – The text creates a straw man by claiming that for Kavanaugh's opponents, "Whether the claims are true is irrelevant," and that they only care about headlines. This misrepresents their stated goal, which was to investigate the claims' truthfulness.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism of Kavanaugh by pointing to alleged hypocrisy or wrongdoing by his opponents. It focuses on directly attacking the credibility of the accusers and their motives.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. It is not a balanced or objective report on events but a highly biased persuasive article with a clear agenda: to defend Brett Kavanaugh and discredit his accusers and political opponents. The piece systematically employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal.

The tone is set immediately by the title, "Avenatti's Freak Show," a prime example of name-calling. This is reinforced throughout with loaded language ("enraged Left," "character-assassination," "frenzied, demagogic assault") designed to evoke an emotional reaction rather than rational consideration. The central strategy is to cast doubt on the accusers' credibility and motives, suggesting they "materialized out of thin air" and that Ford is likely "lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder."

The article constructs a simple narrative (causal oversimplification) that the entire controversy is a political hit job by Democrats, a "frenzied, demagogic assault" to "derail Kavanaugh's nomination." It uses appeals to authority (quoting Trump, Gingrich, Limbaugh) to bolster its case and an appeal to fear to warn of dire consequences ("we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime") if their side does not prevail.

By presenting only information that supports its conclusion and actively refuting, misrepresenting (straw man), and distracting from (red herring) any opposing viewpoints, the text abandons any pretense of journalistic objectivity. Its purpose is not to inform the reader but to manipulate their opinion and solidify a particular worldview. The sheer density and variety of the propaganda techniques used confirm its nature as a propaganda piece.
