Verdict – 60% – The text contains elements of propaganda, primarily through the use of appeal to fear, exaggeration, and loaded language. These techniques aim to evoke strong emotional responses and emphasize the potential threat of the plague mutating and spreading globally. The use of an authority figure to support these claims further contributes to the likelihood of the text being propaganda. However, the text also provides factual information and context, such as the number of infections and deaths, actions taken by WHO, and preventive measures, which balances the overall narrative. Therefore, while there are significant elements of propaganda, the text is not entirely propagandistic.
