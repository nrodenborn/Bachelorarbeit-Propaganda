Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – Explanation: "Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills" (title) and "naïve, inaccurate, misleadingly sunny view" (final paragraphs) are insulting labels attacking Wills.  
2. **Repetition** – No – Explanation: No single phrase or message is repeated verbatim throughout the text.  
3. **Slogans** – No – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL") are used.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Explanation: References to ISIS violence ("blow up the White House," "conquer Rome," "weapons and copies of the Qur’an") instill fear about Islamic terrorism and the Qur’an’s influence.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Explanation: Repeatedly questions Wills’ credibility: "That would be good to know, were Wills a reliable witness," "His manifest unreliability," "Wills is no more trustworthy."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Explanation: Accuses Wills of minimizing Qur’anic violence (e.g., ignoring 9:29, adding "at the shrine" to 2:193) while exaggerating Wills’ errors ("ignores a great deal of Qur’anic incitement").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – Explanation: No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Explanation: Emotionally charged terms like "incitement and hatred," "legerdemain" (trickery), "preposterously," "head-in-the-sand posture," and "fantasy Qur’an."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Explanation: No appeal to an idea’s popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Explanation: No oversimplified cause-effect claims (e.g., complex terrorism drivers aren’t reduced to one factor).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Explanation: Arguments are direct; no deliberate confusion.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Explanation: Cites Islamic authorities (e.g., Bulandshahri) and ISIS practices as evidence against Wills’ interpretation.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Explanation: Presents the Qur’an as either "peaceful" (Wills’ view) or inherently violent (Spencer’s view), ignoring nuanced interpretations: "if the Islamic holy book is really as peaceful... why do so very many Muslims worldwide misunderstand it?"  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – Explanation: No phrases like "it is what it is" to halt debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – Explanation: All examples (e.g., ISIS, Qur’an verses) directly challenge Wills’ claims.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Explanation: Misrepresents Wills’ Sharia argument: Wills says the Qur’an says "not a thing" about Sharia *law* (a system), but Spencer refutes by listing Qur’anic *verses used in* Sharia—a different claim.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., "Wills criticizes X but does Y").  

---

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques (e.g., Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language, Straw Men) to discredit Garry Wills and advance the argument that the Qur’an promotes violence. It selectively presents evidence (omitting Wills’ counterpoints), uses emotionally charged language ("incitement," "fantasy"), and frames the issue as a binary choice (Black & White Fallacy). While it cites specific Qur’anic verses and real-world examples (ISIS), these are deployed to evoke fear and dismiss Wills’ perspective rather than engage neutrally. The author’s agenda—promoting a view of the Qur’an as inherently violent—is clear, and the techniques overshadow balanced analysis. However, the presence of sourced references (e.g., Qur’an 4:89) prevents a 100% rating, as it incorporates factual elements amid persuasive tactics.
