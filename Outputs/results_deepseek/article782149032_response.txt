### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Jihadi Muslims," "devout ('extremist') Muslims." Insults Muslims with labels associating them with terrorism.  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases unrelated to repetition (e.g., no standalone slogans like "Make America Great").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "Horrifying Details," "deadly," "murder," and "starved to almost certain death" instill fear about Islamic compounds.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions law enforcement motives: "What is the first thing they do...?" and "making Islam look good seems to be the top priority."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates negligence ("FBI did nothing despite tips") and minimizes law enforcement rationale for destroying the compound.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Destroyed evidence," "cover up," "negligence," "sharia compliance" evoke anger and bias.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No emphasis on an idea's popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames the compound's destruction solely on covering "negligence" and appeasing Muslims, ignoring other potential factors.  
12. **Obfuscation** – **No** – Accusations are direct, not vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – No authoritative figures cited for support.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – The Kavanaugh poll presents only "yes" or "no" options, ignoring nuanced outcomes.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Sharia compliance" ends discussion by implying automatic submission to Islamic law.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The abrupt Kavanaugh poll distracts from the main story about the compound.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – All refuted arguments (e.g., law enforcement priorities) are explicitly stated.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy against critics.

### Verdict – 95% –   
**Explanation:** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic, employing at least 10 distinct techniques. It uses inflammatory language ("Jihadi Muslims," "sharia compliance") to demonize Muslims and frame law enforcement as complicit in a cover-up. Fear-mongering ("Horrifying Details," child murder) and exaggeration (claiming authorities "did nothing") manipulate emotions. Logical fallacies like *causal oversimplification* (reducing the compound's destruction to a conspiracy) and *black & white* framing (Kavanaugh poll) suppress critical thinking. The *red herring* (Kavanaugh poll) and *thought-terminating clichés* ("sharia compliance") further derail discourse. While not every technique is present, the density of manipulative tactics, biased sourcing ("Posted with permission from Pamela Geller" – a known anti-Muslim activist), and sensationalist structure confirm a clear agenda to vilify Islam and distrust institutions. The 5% uncertainty arises from the inclusion of factual elements (e.g., charges filed), though these are weaponized to serve the propaganda.
