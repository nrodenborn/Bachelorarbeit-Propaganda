Certainly! Here is the analysis, following your requested format for each propaganda technique, with examples or explanations as appropriate:

---

**1. Name calling – Yes – Explanation:**  
Ferrara refers to Fastiggi’s argument as “sophistical,” calls his questions “clumsy and insulting,” and refers to defenders of Amoris Laetitia as “latter-day Pharisees and legalists.” These are derogatory labels.

**2. Repetition – No – Explanation:**  
There is no clear repetition of a specific phrase or message throughout the text.

**3. Slogans – No – Explanation:**  
No brief, memorable slogans are used.

**4. Appeal to fear – No – Explanation:**  
There is no attempt to instill fear about alternatives or outcomes.

**5. Doubt – Yes – Explanation:**  
Ferrara questions Fastiggi’s understanding (“You do not reveal a proper understanding…”) and the credibility of his arguments (“demonstrate a pronounced lack of comprehension…”).

**6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation:**  
Ferrara uses phrases like “a growing mountain of evidence” and “a moral catastrophe is self-evidently underway,” which exaggerate the scale of the issue.

**7. Flag-Waving – No – Explanation:**  
There is no direct appeal to patriotism or group identity.

**8. Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation:**  
Terms such as “public adulterers,” “fig leaf to conceal,” “moral catastrophe,” “embarrassing lack of rhetorical finesse,” and “pretend” are emotionally charged.

**9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation:**  
There is no comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups.

**10. Bandwagon – Yes – Explanation:**  
Ferrara says, “Tell that to the four cardinals, the 800,000 faithful, the 45 theologians and the 61 other original signers of the correctio,” appealing to the popularity or widespread support of his view.

**11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation:**  
Ferrara claims, “A moral catastrophe is self-evidently underway and it is not possible honestly to deny its cause,” oversimplifying complex ecclesial and theological developments to a single cause.

**12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanation:**  
The arguments are detailed and specific, not intentionally vague or obscure.

**13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation:**  
Both sides cite authorities: Fastiggi references Cardinal Müller and Cardinal Schoenborn; Ferrara references “the four cardinals,” “800,000 faithful,” and “the 45 theologians.”

**14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation:**  
Ferrara presents the situation as either admitting public adulterers to Communion (bad) or upholding Church discipline (good), with little room for nuance.

**15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation:**  
Ferrara says, “I cannot help him,” and “I respectfully suggest that Dr. Fastiggi’s comments evince a need for serious study and reflection before he ventures further opinions,” which serve to shut down further discussion.

**16. Red herring – No – Explanation:**  
There are no clear attempts to distract with irrelevant material.

**17. Straw men – Yes – Explanation:**  
Ferrara attributes to Fastiggi the position that “there is nothing problematical about AL,” which is an oversimplification of Fastiggi’s more nuanced argument.

**18. Whataboutism – No – Explanation:**  
There is no direct charge of hypocrisy or “what about X” argument.

### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques (name calling, loaded language, bandwagon, exaggeration, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, thought-terminating clichés, straw man, etc.), especially in Ferrara’s responses. The tone is polemical and adversarial, with emotionally charged language and rhetorical strategies aimed at discrediting the opponent and rallying support. However, the text also contains substantive argumentation, citations, and attempts at reasoned debate, particularly from Fastiggi. Thus, while the text is not pure propaganda, it is significantly propagandistic in its approach and style, especially on Ferrara’s side.**
