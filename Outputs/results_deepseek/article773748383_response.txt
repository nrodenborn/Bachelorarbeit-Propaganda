Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by a verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "Fool’s errand" (in the title) is an insulting label for the goal of gun control.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans promoting a specific idea beyond product names ("Ghost Gunner").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Repeated emphasis on the impossibility of regulating "ghost guns," leading to criminals easily obtaining untraceable weapons (e.g., "It will be even more difficult to impose background checks, which have proven quite useless anyway," "The government has been no more effective at stopping criminals from getting guns than at stopping them from obtaining drugs").
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – Repeatedly questions the effectiveness and feasibility of government regulation and background checks (e.g., "How the government will stop people from obtaining these printers isn’t exactly obvious," "Proposals... are easily defeated," "what is going to stop gangs from stealing them?", "difficult to see how 'ghost guns' could ever be regulated").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "deals a death blow" (exaggeration of the settlement's impact), "practically impossible" (exaggeration of the difficulty of gun control), "laughable" (minimization of the potential effectiveness of bullet magazine limits), "quite useless" (minimization of background checks).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Fool’s errand," "death blow," "ruckus," "capitulated," "laughable," "useless," "game changer." These words carry strong negative or dramatic connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association of opponents/gun control with universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Highlights the high number of downloads globally ("100,000 copies... downloaded," "most downloads came from Spain, followed by the U.S., Brazil and Germany") to imply widespread acceptance/need, especially to evade restrictive laws.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes the near-impossibility of gun control almost solely to the existence of 3D printers and internet file sharing, ignoring other complex factors (e.g., "3D printers make the already extremely difficult job of controlling access to guns practically impossible").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is generally direct in its arguments against gun control feasibility.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites the DOJ settlement, court rulings (even though plaintiffs lost lower courts initially), and the arguments of the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) and DD as validating their position (e.g., "This is an important victory for First Amendment rights," "The Justice Department’s recent settlement... is very favorable to him").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents the situation as gun control being completely futile ("practically impossible," "difficult, if not impossible," "could ever be regulated") versus no effective regulation possible, ignoring potential middle-ground solutions or regulatory approaches.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "game changer" is used to shut down further critical discussion about potential regulatory approaches by framing the technology as inherently disruptive beyond control.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introduces the comparison to the government's inability to stop illegal drugs and links it to gangs ("The government has been no more effective at stopping criminals from getting guns than at stopping them from obtaining drugs. That isn’t too surprising, as drug gangs are the source of both illegal drugs and guns.") This distracts from the specific issue of regulating 3D-printed guns.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text argues against the feasibility of gun control in light of new technology, but doesn't misrepresent a specific opposing argument not made.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Does not charge gun control advocates specifically with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated issues.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Bandwagon, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating cliché, Red Herring). Its primary purpose is not simply to inform about the settlement or 3D-printed guns, but to vigorously persuade the reader that gun control is fundamentally futile and doomed to fail specifically because of this technology. It uses emotionally charged language, fear appeals, oversimplification of causes, and dismissive clichés to advance this specific agenda and discourage consideration of regulatory efforts. While it contains factual elements (the settlement, the history of the case, the existence of the technology), the framing, selection of facts, and persuasive techniques overwhelmingly dominate, aligning with the core function of propaganda: promoting a specific viewpoint, often by simplifying complex issues and appealing to emotion rather than fostering balanced critical analysis.
