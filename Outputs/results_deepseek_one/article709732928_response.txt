Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by a verdict:

**Propaganda Technique Analysis:**

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Clinton camp," "Clinton team," "ugly Clinton led deal," "hostile regime, Putin Russia" (insulting labels framing the Clintons/Russia negatively).
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on "documents," "evidence," "bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering," "follow the money," and "who knew what, when" to reinforce allegations.
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Follow the money" (used repeatedly as a memorable phrase encapsulating the investigation's focus).
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "This is all about to get very ugly," "national security compromise," "control of U.S. Nuclear fuel," "United States at a disadvantage" (instills fear about national security and corruption).
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "why are you paying attention?" "why was that decision made?" "CFIUS either wasn’t told, or CFIUS people knowing about it" (questions the credibility/actions of Obama officials).
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "Bombshell," "treasure trove of documents," "exploding scandal," "devastating" (exaggerates the scale/impact). Minimizes Trump-Russia links: "less likely than ever that President Trump did anything wrong."
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "American hero," "national security compromise," "United States at a disadvantage," "American people deserve the truth" (appeals to patriotism and national security).
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Bombshell," "exploding scandal," "ugly Clinton led deal," "bad actor," "hostile regime," "corruption," "deep dive," "devastating" (emotionally charged, negative language).
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Hitler/Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "Right about now the people in the Clinton camp should be getting very nervous," "it is beginning to cascade," "I’m not the only one thinking that" (implies growing consensus/investigative momentum).
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes complex events (uranium deal, alleged corruption) solely to Clinton/Obama administration actions and corruption ("follow the money" to Clinton Foundation).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – "high ranking Congressman and that knows," "will be able to talk about that in the next couple of weeks," "reporting that will be revealing," "new flows of money" (vague promises of future revelations without specifics).
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Relies on statements from Hannity, Carter, Solomon, Toensing (presented as credible investigators/attorneys), and a "high ranking Congressman" as authoritative sources.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the issue as a binary choice: Clinton/Obama corruption vs. truth/justice ("deserve a Pulitzer," "American hero," "facing their day of reckoning?").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "It goes without saying," "of course," "follow the money," "who knew what, when" (phrases used to shut down questioning of claims).
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Shifting focus from Uranium One specifics to the Clinton Foundation, Obama administration officials (Holder, Mueller), and future reports on "Clinton global initiative" (irrelevant to the alleged crimes in the deal).
17. **Straw men** – **No** – No clear misrepresentation of an absent opposing argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – While contrasting Trump/Russia probes, it doesn't directly charge critics with hypocrisy for investigating Trump but not Clinton.

**Verdict – 80% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is to persuade the audience of widespread Clinton/Obama corruption regarding the Uranium One deal, using sensationalized language ("Bombshell," "treasure trove"), repetition of unproven allegations, appeals to fear/patriotism, and reliance on selected "authorities" (Hannity, Carter, Solomon). It frames the issue in starkly binary terms (corrupt actors vs. truth-seekers), employs vague promises of future revelations, and diverts attention via red herrings (Clinton Foundation). While presenting factual elements (e.g., existence of an FBI informant, CFIUS approval), the overwhelming use of loaded language, exaggeration, and selective framing clearly aims to promote a specific, highly negative narrative rather than provide a balanced or objective report. The sourcing (Hannity monologue, selected guests) and lack of counter-evidence or critical context further indicate a propagandistic intent.
