Based on the provided definitions and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "total witch hunt" (Used by Trump to label the probe).
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable promotional phrases are used.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text reports events and statements but does not attempt to instill fear to support an idea or alternative.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text reports facts and statements without actively questioning the credibility of individuals or entities involved.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text reports facts (indictments, convictions, scope) without obvious exaggeration or minimization.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There are no appeals to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "total witch hunt" (Used by Trump, carries strong negative connotations and emotional weight).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No disapproval is based on associating ideas with hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal is made based on the popularity of an idea.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Complex events (like the investigation or its findings) are not explained by attributing them to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text reports clearly on the status of the report, its contents (as known), and the outcomes of the investigation. Barr's statement about consulting on "what other information" can be released is procedural, not intentionally vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While authorities are cited (Mueller, Barr, Schiff, Trump), their statements are reported as facts or positions, not used as evidence to support a specific claim within the text's own narrative.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents the complexity of the investigation, its findings, ongoing probes, and differing viewpoints (like Schiff calling for transparency) without reducing options to only two extremes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used that inherently shut down critical thought. "Witch hunt" is a loaded term used by Trump, but the text itself doesn't employ such clichés.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the Mueller report submission, its contents, related investigations, and reactions. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text reports arguments and statements (like Schiff's legal point or Trump's denial) without misrepresenting or refuting a position not actually held.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are made against opponents to deflect criticism.

**Verdict – 10% –** The text is overwhelmingly a factual news report detailing the conclusion of the Mueller investigation, the submission of the report, known findings (indictments/convictions), reactions from key figures (Barr, Schiff, Trump), and the status of related investigations. It presents information neutrally, cites sources, and avoids most persuasive techniques. The primary element leaning towards propaganda is the inclusion of Trump's emotionally charged, loaded language ("total witch hunt") without counter-commentary, which serves his perspective. However, this is presented as a direct quote attributed to him within a larger factual framework, not as the text's own framing device. The core purpose appears to be informing, not systematically persuading the audience towards a specific agenda using multiple manipulative techniques.
