Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Factory" (referring to the Vatican apparatus), "outrageous proposition," "nonsense," "ignorant critics," "neo-Catholic establishment," "Bergoglian Mercy Train," "Pharisee," "cunning ecclesiastical politician."  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "What the Pope Really Means®" (repeated 3 times), "limits" (repeated with emphasis), "objectively immoral behavior" (repeated to reinforce the claim).  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "What the Pope Really Means®" (used as a branded dismissal of opposing interpretations).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "train wreck at the end of the line," "grave harm upon the Church," "undermining Holy Matrimony, Confession and Holy Communion," "ecclesial auto-demolition" (implies catastrophic consequences).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "It seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice" (questions their honesty), "including those ignorant Vatican translators" (questions translator competence).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "outrageous proposition," "storm of criticism," "perniciousness," "train wreck." Minimization: Reducing Fastiggi/Goldstein's argument to "linguistic tinkering" and "nonsense."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national/group identity. Focuses on Catholic orthodoxy, not broader identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "infamous paragraph," "heterodox interpretation," "subvert the Church," "adulterous relations," "shameful defense," "brutally removed" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Hitler/Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Indirect Yes – "rising opposition among the faithful," "signers of the Correctio" (implies growing support for the author's view).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes all controversy to deliberate ambiguity: "Bergoglio’s plan of promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document... is the reason I signed onto the Correctio." Ignores other theological nuances.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is confrontational but clear in its claims. No deliberate vagueness.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites Joseph Shaw, Correctio Filialis signatories, and historical councils (Third Council of Constantinople) to validate arguments.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents orthodoxy vs. heterodoxy as the only options: "it is not our responsibility to bend a Pope’s statements into conformity with the Faith" (implies no middle ground).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Give. Me. A. Break.," "No problem here!" (dismisses opposing arguments without engagement).  
16. **Red herring** – No – Stays focused on Amoris Laetitia, its translation, and theological implications. No irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Portrays Fastiggi/Goldstein as claiming "objectively immoral behavior... is no longer simply objectively immoral behavior but rather a gift of self" (oversimplifies their argument about "offering" as excusing sin).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy against critics. Focuses on attacking the document and its defenders.  

---

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 13/18 techniques, with heavy reliance on **name-calling**, **loaded language**, **exaggeration**, and **appeal to fear** to discredit Pope Francis, theologians (Fastiggi/Goldstein), and Church institutions. The core argument—that *Amoris Laetitia* promotes heresy—is framed through **black/white fallacies** and **straw men**, dismissing nuanced theological debate. **Repetition** of phrases like "What the Pope Really Means®" and **thought-terminating clichés** ("Give. Me. A. Break.") stifle counterarguments. While it cites legitimate concerns (e.g., translation issues), the tone is relentlessly polemical, aiming to delegitimize opponents rather than engage substantively. Historical comparisons (Honorius I) and appeals to authority (Correctio Filialis) further sensationalize the conflict. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the text’s basis in real theological disputes, but its manipulative presentation aligns squarely with propaganda.
