### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Cop Killer Supporter Keith Ellison," "epitome of an effeminate man," "demonic religion, Islam," "minions," "Hakim Muhammad." Insults target Ellison's character, religion, and associations.  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley..." is repeated verbatim three times, emphasizing a separate agenda.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases central to the core message.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Implies Ellison’s actions threaten public safety (e.g., "supports cop killers," linking him to terrorists like Chesimard).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Ellison’s credibility throughout (e.g., "baldly dissembled," "extraordinarily poor fit for the job," "no attorney's license").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates Ellison’s ties (e.g., "demonic religion," "supports cop killers"); minimizes abuse allegations’ complexity (framed as indisputable truth).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to patriotism/law enforcement identity (e.g., portraying Ellison as anti-police, emphasizing Officer Haaf’s murder).  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotional/derogatory terms: "demonic," "sordid history," "fled the scene," "minions," "terrorist career."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – Links Ellison to universally condemned figures/groups (e.g., Nation of Islam, cop killers, terrorists like Chesimard).  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – The poll implies readers should join the majority in replacing Nikki Haley.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Reduces complex issues (e.g., abuse allegations, Ellison’s activism) to simple malice or corruption.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Language is inflammatory but not deliberately vague; arguments are explicit.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites "Scott Johnson," "The Weekly Standard," and FBI classifications to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents Ellison as wholly corrupt (e.g., "supports cop killers" vs. law-abiding citizens; no nuance in abuse claims).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Phrases like "Shame on you, Hakim Muhammad!" and "Cop Killer Supporter" shut down discourse.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Irrelevant focus on Ellison’s religion ("demonic religion, Islam") distracts from abuse allegations.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents Ellison’s activism as direct support for murder (e.g., conflating legal advocacy for defendants with endorsing crime).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No deflection via opponent hypocrisy.

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 95% – Propaganda**  
**Explanation:** The text systematically employs at least 14/18 propaganda techniques to vilify Keith Ellison. It uses *name-calling*, *loaded language*, and *fear appeals* ("cop killer supporter," "demonic religion") to dehumanize him. *Exaggeration* (e.g., ties to terrorism) and *black/white framing* ignore nuance, while *doubt* and *appeals to authority* manufacture distrust. *Reduction ad Hitlerum* links him to universally hated groups, and *causal oversimplification* reduces his activism to malice. Though fact-based elements exist (e.g., historical events), they are cherry-picked, stripped of context, and weaponized to advance a narrative. The hyperbolic tone, ad hominem attacks, and reliance on emotional manipulation over balanced analysis confirm its propagandistic intent. The 5% uncertainty arises from the inclusion of verifiable events (e.g., Ellison’s past associations), but their presentation is overwhelmingly distorted to serve a political agenda.
