1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels bishops who do not follow Bishop Morlino’s example as “complicit with the degenerate and even criminal shepherds.” It also refers to the problem he is addressing as a “beast.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The message that sin must be hated is repeated. The editor’s note quotes the Bishop saying, “what the Church needs now is more hatred!” and the Bishop’s letter repeats this exact phrase, “If you’ll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!”

3. Slogans – Yes – The editor’s note uses the short, memorable phrase, “This is what a courageous shepherd looks like!” to praise Bishop Morlino and create a positive, memorable image of him.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The editor’s note instills fear by suggesting that if other bishops do not follow Bishop Morlino’s lead, they will be “complicit with the degenerate and even criminal shepherds,” implying that inaction will lead to the Church being run by criminals.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and motives of Church leaders who have not acted, asking, “Is it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being ‘pastoral?’ Have we covered over the truth out of fear?”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The editor’s note describes the situation as “the most vile clergy sex scandal in history,” which is an exaggeration using a superlative to heighten the emotional impact.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the identity of being a “faithful Catholic.” The editor’s note mentions that the diocese has been a “port in the storm for many displaced and disillusioned Catholic families,” appealing to a specific Catholic identity. The Bishop’s closing line, “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord,” is a declaration of allegiance to his faith community.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words. For example, it describes the attacks on the Bishop as “scurrilous” and the shepherds who don’t follow his lead as “degenerate.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the technique’s logic is used by disapproving of an idea because it is popular with a group hated by the audience. The text states that bishops who condemn homosexual acts will “incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church,” thereby framing any alternative action as siding with these hated “enemies.”

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea. In fact, it does the opposite, portraying Bishop Morlino as a courageous, solitary figure standing against a popular tide.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex and multifaceted clergy abuse crisis by attributing it primarily to a single cause: “It is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and explicit in its claims and demands. Bishop Morlino even states, “I am tired of the obfuscation of truth,” positioning his letter as an act of clarity, not vagueness.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the authority of “St. Thomas Aquinas” and the “Book of Proverbs” to support the idea that hating wickedness is a virtue.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The editor’s note presents only two options for the American bishops: “either follow suit or face the charge of being complicit.” This ignores any other possible responses or nuanced positions.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The Bishop’s letter uses the phrase “The Church’s teaching is clear that…” to present a premise as an unchallengeable fact, discouraging further critical thought on the matter. The closing line, “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord,” also serves to end debate with a declaration of ultimate faith.

16. Red herring – No – The text remains highly focused on its central argument about the cause of the abuse crisis and the proper response. It does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the audience.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an oversimplified version of an opposing argument by stating, “until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia — this despite clear evidence to the contrary.” This refutes a simplified argument (that the problem is *only* pedophilia) to make its own argument seem more necessary and insightful.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by pointing to the hypocrisy of an opponent. Its focus is on perceived failings within the Church itself, rather than trying to change the subject to what an external critic has done.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform objectively, but to persuade the audience to adopt a very specific and controversial viewpoint regarding the cause of the Catholic Church's sexual abuse crisis. It achieves this by employing a high density of propaganda techniques.

The text uses Causal Oversimplification to pinpoint a “homosexual subculture” as the main culprit, ignoring other complex factors. This is reinforced with highly emotional and Loaded Language (“degenerate,” “vile,” “beast”) and Name Calling to demonize this group and those who might be “complicit.” It creates a stark in-group/out-group dynamic through Flag-Waving (appealing to “faithful Catholics”) and a Black & White Fallacy that presents only two choices: follow Bishop Morlino’s path or be complicit in the Church’s destruction. This is amplified by an Appeal to Fear. The argument is buttressed by Appeals to Authority (St. Thomas Aquinas, the Bible) to give it theological weight. The entire piece, from the editor’s fawning introduction to the Bishop’s rigid call to action, is structured to direct the audience’s anger and fear toward a specific internal enemy and rally them behind a single, "courageous" leader, which is a classic function of propaganda.
