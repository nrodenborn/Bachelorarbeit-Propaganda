1. Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack any person or group. It uses factual descriptors like "ranchers" and "protesters."
2. Repetition – No – The text is a news report and does not repeat a specific message to influence the reader.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases intended as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text reports on past events and does not attempt to instill fear in the reader about alternative outcomes.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text quotes the White House statement which calls the resentencing of the Hammonds "unjust," thereby questioning the credibility and fairness of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text quotes the White House statement, which uses emotionally appealing language to describe the Hammonds, such as: “[They] are devoted family men, respected contributors to their local community... Justice is overdue for Dwight and Steven Hammond, both of whom are entirely deserving of these Grants of Executive Clemency.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text quotes the White House statement which claims the Hammonds "have widespread support from their neighbors, local law enforcement, and farmers and ranchers across the West," suggesting their cause is popular and therefore correct.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion.
16. Red herring – No – All the information presented in the text, such as the background of the armed standoff, is relevant to the context of the presidential pardons.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge anyone with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 20% – The text is a news article from a mainstream source (POLITICO) and its primary purpose is to inform, not to persuade. The language used by the author of the article is largely neutral and factual. However, the article contains several propaganda techniques within direct quotations, primarily from the official White House statement justifying the pardons. By reporting these statements, the article acts as a vehicle for techniques like Loaded Language, Minimization, Bandwagon, and Doubt. Because the text itself is framed as a news report and includes context and different sides of the issue (e.g., the original reason for the conviction), it is not a pure piece of propaganda. The 20% likelihood reflects that while the article's structure is journalistic, it uncritically includes and amplifies statements that are clearly propagandistic in nature.
