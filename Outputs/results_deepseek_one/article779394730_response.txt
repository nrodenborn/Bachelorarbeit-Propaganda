Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses insulting labels like "sodomitical clergy" and "lavender liturgy" to attack the subject (clergy/church).
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: While rhetorical questions are used ("What exactly...?"), there is no significant repetition of the *same core phrase or message* throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses the brief, memorable hashtag slogan "#stopthesynod".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Instills fear about children's safety ("I'd sooner let my kids be accompanied by fans of the Oakland Raiders than turn them over to you") and the state of the church ("rampant homosexuality", "widespread apostasy", "heretical homilies") to reject the "Church of Accompaniment".
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – Explanation: The text makes strong assertions and accusations, but doesn't primarily frame its argument by *questioning the credibility* of specific claims or sources presented by opponents.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses exaggerated terms like "rampant homosexuality," "widespread apostasy," and "heretical homilies" without specific evidence provided in the text. Minimizes the value of Vatican II ("can't seem to think of a darn thing").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: While appealing to a specific group (traditional Catholics), it does not primarily appeal to patriotism or a broad national/group identity like "American" or "Christian". The appeal is more sectarian/internal to Catholicism.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Heavily relies on emotionally charged, negative, and stereotypical language throughout the commentary section: "sodomitical clergy," "lavender liturgy," "heretical homilies," "rampant homosexuality," "widespread apostasy," "trivialized liturgy," "God of Surprises" (used sarcastically), "uber-merciful" (used sarcastically), "breaks Catholic traditions," "disordered attachments," "take your 'Church of Accompaniment' to prison".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: Does not attempt to disapprove of an idea by associating it with Nazis, the Vichy regime, or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: Does not argue that an idea should be accepted because it's popular or gaining support. The focus is on condemnation, not popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: While blaming Vatican II and "aggiornamento" for negative outcomes, the text lists multiple complex issues (abuse, liturgy, doctrine, homosexuality, apostasy) without explicitly reducing them to *one simple cause* in this specific passage.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The commentary is actually quite direct and inflammatory in its accusations, not deliberately vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: Cites Pope Benedict XVI ("trivialized liturgy") and Fr. Thomas Rosica, but these are used as sources for specific claims within the polemic, not primarily as authoritative endorsements of the *overall argument* being made. The overall tone relies more on emotion and accusation than cited authority.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents a stark choice: reject the current church leadership entirely ("You can take your 'Church of Accompaniment' to prison with you," "Thanks, but no thanks") or accept all its perceived failures. Implies there are no middle grounds or nuances in dealing with the church crisis.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: The rhetorical questions and sarcastic remarks ("Well played, Cardinal Wuerl!", "You don't say!") are provocative, but they don't function as simplistic phrases designed to *shut down* critical thought on the topic. They aim to provoke outrage rather than end discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on its criticism of the church hierarchy, scandals, Vatican II, and specific practices. It doesn't introduce a significantly *irrelevant* topic to distract from this core focus.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text attacks specific concepts promoted by church leaders ("Church of Accompaniment," "synodal Church," "God of Surprises," "aggiornamento") and specific practices/outcomes (homosexuality in priesthood, trivialized liturgy, apostasy). While it characterizes these negatively, it doesn't significantly misrepresent a *specific opposing argument* not presented and then refute that misrepresentation.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not charge its opponents (church leadership) with hypocrisy by pointing to their other failings or inconsistencies. It directly condemns them for the scandals and perceived failures, not for being hypocrites *about something else*.

**Verdict – 90% – Explanation:** The text begins with factual reporting on the Pennsylvania grand jury report. However, the section clearly labeled "REMNANT COMMENT" and everything following it constitutes strong propaganda. This section extensively uses **Loaded Language** ("sodomitical clergy," "lavender liturgy," "heretical homilies," "rampant homosexuality," etc.) to evoke strong negative emotions. It employs **Name Calling** directly against clergy and practices. It uses **Appeal to Fear** regarding children's safety. It engages in **Exaggeration/Minimization** ("rampant," "widespread," "can't think of a darn thing" [good]). It presents a **Black & White Fallacy**, demanding complete rejection of the current church direction. It uses a **Slogan** (#stopthesynod). The tone is highly sarcastic, dismissive, and inflammatory ("Well played, Cardinal Wuerl!", "You don't say!", "Thanks, but no thanks"). While it references real events (the grand jury report, McCarrick, quotes from Benedict/Rosica), these are used as springboards for a polemical attack filled with emotionally charged generalizations and accusations aimed at discrediting the current church leadership, Vatican II reforms, and specific theological concepts, rather than offering a balanced analysis. The overwhelming use of multiple propaganda techniques, particularly in the commentary section, makes the text overwhelmingly propagandistic in nature.
