1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack Don Lemon and his employer, such as "absolute hypocrite," "useful idiot, propagandist snowflake," and calls CNN a "hypocritical, lying, fake news outlet."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question, "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated three times consecutively. The charge of "hypocrisy" is also repeated throughout the text.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the phrase "fake news outlet," a brief and memorable phrase used to discredit a news source.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear of the migrant caravan by describing them as "committing all sorts of crimes" and asks if "military force should be used to stop" them.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire piece is designed to cast doubt on the credibility of Don Lemon and CNN, labeling CNN a "hypocritical, lying, fake news outlet" and questioning Lemon's consistency and sanity ("How can he contradict himself like that and not even bat an eyelid?").
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the meaning of Don Lemon's words by concluding, "He just doesn't want white men here." It also uses the broad exaggeration that the migrants are "committing all sorts of crimes."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national identity by framing the issue around defending "the US border" from those who would "illegally enter the country against our immigration laws."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to evoke a strong reaction, such as "absolute hypocrite," "lying, fake news outlet," "utterly insane," and "propagandist snowflake."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest that Don Lemon's ideas are popular with Nazis or other similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text implies that its position is "common sense," suggesting that any reasonable person would agree. The inclusion of a poll also encourages readers to join a perceived majority opinion.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies Don Lemon's complex and controversial statement about domestic terror threats into a simple, singular motive: "He just doesn't want white men here."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; its language is direct, aggressive, and clear in its intent to condemn Don Lemon and CNN.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does not cite any experts or authority figures to support its claims. Instead, it attacks the authority of a news personality and his network.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents only two extreme options for dealing with the migrant caravan: "Yes, military force should be used" or "No, keep the military out of it," ignoring a wide range of other possible diplomatic and humanitarian responses.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like "fake news outlet" and "common sense" to dismiss opposing viewpoints and discourage critical engagement with the actual issues.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces "Islamic jihad" and "Chris Cuomo's statism" as tangential points that distract from the central topic of Don Lemon's specific comments about the migrant caravan and domestic terrorism.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument Lemon never made by stating, "He just doesn't want white men here." This is a distorted and exaggerated version of Lemon's actual statement, making it easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The central theme of the article is to accuse Don Lemon of hypocrisy ("Talk about an absolute hypocrite!"). It deflects from the substance of Lemon's claim about domestic terror threats by focusing entirely on his perceived self-contradiction.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and overt example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of Don Lemon, CNN, and migrants, while reinforcing a specific political ideology. This is achieved through the heavy and combined use of numerous propaganda techniques. The article is built on a foundation of **whataboutism** and **name-calling** ("hypocrite," "snowflake"). It employs **loaded language** and **appeals to fear** to create a strong emotional response against its targets. Furthermore, it uses logical fallacies like the **straw man** (misrepresenting Lemon's argument as "He just doesn't want white men here") and the **black & white fallacy** (in the poll) to manipulate the reader's perception. The use of **thought-terminating clichés** like "fake news" and "common sense" serves to shut down critical thinking. The sheer density and variety of these techniques indicate a deliberate effort to manipulate opinion rather than engage in honest debate or reporting.
