Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "hate group leader" (referring to Farrakhan), "notorious anti-Semite".  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated mentions of Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic quotes (e.g., "Jews are satanic," "praised Hitler," "white people deserve to die").  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Implies black leaders "get away" with supporting extremism while white leaders wouldn’t, creating fear of double standards: *"a white congressman would **not get away** with saying he agrees with David Duke... But black leaders have gotten away..."*.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions ADL/JTA’s credibility: *"The ADL and JTA will **whitewash** this again... they'll **ignore it**"*.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism: Davis calls it *"just one segment of what goes on in our world"*.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or group identity beyond implied racial dynamics.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms like *"whitewash," "notorious anti-Semite," "hate group leader"*.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – Repeatedly links Farrakhan to Hitler: *"praised Adolf Hitler as a ‘very great man’"*.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on popularity to sway opinion.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified causes for complex issues.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Statements are direct, not intentionally vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authoritative figures cited for validation.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents a false dichotomy: *Either* media "whitewashes" Farrakhan support *or* ignores it (*"if they can’t whitewash this, they’ll ignore it"*).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Davis’s dismissive phrase: *"that’s their thing, but it ain’t my thing"* halts critical discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions; all points relate to Farrakhan/ADL.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Arguments refuted (e.g., ADL’s claim of misquoting) are accurately presented.  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Deflects criticism by invoking hypothetical white racism: *"a white congressman would **not get away** with saying he agrees with David Duke"*.

---

**Verdict – 85%** – The text is highly likely propaganda. It employs multiple loaded techniques (e.g., **name-calling**, **loaded language**, **reduction ad Hitlerum**) to vilify Farrakhan and discredit Davis, while framing media/ADL as complicit via **doubt** and **black-and-white fallacy**. The **whataboutism** comparing Farrakhan to David Duke and the **minimization** of anti-Semitism further reveal a biased narrative. Though it reports factual quotes, selective emphasis (e.g., omitting Davis’s full context) and inflammatory framing ("*Jewish question*") serve to inflame rather than inform. The absence of counterpoints and reliance on emotional manipulation align with propagandistic goals of polarizing readers on racial/religious lines.
