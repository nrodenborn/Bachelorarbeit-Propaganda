Verdict – 5% – The text is primarily informational and provides factual details about the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It cites authoritative sources like the WHO and Congo's Health Ministry to support its information. There is no evident use of propaganda techniques to manipulate or influence the audience's perception beyond providing factual updates and context about the Ebola virus. The only technique present is an appeal to authority, which is appropriate in the context of reporting on a health crisis. Therefore, the likelihood of this text being propaganda is very low.
