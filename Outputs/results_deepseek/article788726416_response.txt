4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "...make sure the truth... remains hidden from the eyes of the American public" (implies Americans are being deprived of vital truths).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "...to find collusion where there is none" (questions the legitimacy of the investigation).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "...multi-million dollar witch hunt" (exaggerates the investigation's cost/purpose; minimizes its legitimacy).

### Verdict – 90% – Explanation:  
The text is highly likely propaganda due to pervasive use of manipulative techniques. It employs **name-calling** ("Deep State," "tool"), **repetition**, **slogans**, and **loaded language** to vilify opponents (e.g., DOJ, Democrats) while glorifying Trump's actions as transparent and constitutional. It uses **appeal to fear** (hidden truth), **doubt** (dismissing collusion), **exaggeration** ("witch hunt"), **flag-waving** (protecting the public), and **black/white framing** to polarize readers. The inclusion of **thought-terminating clichés** ("all you need to know") discourages scrutiny. Though it avoids some techniques (e.g., obfuscation, whataboutism), the overwhelming reliance on emotional appeals, one-sided rhetoric, and demonizing language aligns with propaganda’s core function: to persuade through manipulation rather than evidence-based argument. Sources like "The Duran" and "Zerohedge" (noted for partisan slant) further support this assessment.
