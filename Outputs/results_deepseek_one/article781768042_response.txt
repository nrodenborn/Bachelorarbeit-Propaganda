1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Ungrateful reprobates, pretenders, counterfeits and hypocrites" (used to describe modern Christians).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll repeats "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans (e.g., no equivalent to "Build the Wall").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings like "destruction that will not be reversed" and God judging America instill fear of divine retribution.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions the credibility of modern Christians: "They wear the cross. Yet, they have no testimony of the power of God."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates with "58 million innocent babies" (abortion statistic debate) and minimizes modern Christians' faith as "feigned strength."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity; focus is religious, not nationalistic.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms like "rampant criminals," "fiery sulfur," "damnation," and "ungrateful reprobates."

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Language is direct and biblically referenced, not obscure.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Relies on biblical authority (e.g., Genesis, Proverbs, Jeremiah) to validate arguments.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents only two choices: obey God’s commandments or face destruction (e.g., "Deuteronomy 30:19").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is"; instead, rhetorical questions invite engagement.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All content ties back to the core argument about moral failure.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents opponents: "teach to submit to tyranny" (oversimplifies Christian teachings on Romans 13).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting specific individuals/groups.

**Verdict – 85%** – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs multiple persuasive techniques (e.g., name-calling, fear appeals, loaded language, causal oversimplification) to advance a specific ideological agenda: condemning modern American Christians and framing societal issues as divine punishment for moral compromise. It selectively uses scripture to vilify opponents (e.g., comparing them to Sodomites), exaggerates problems (e.g., abortion statistics), and creates false dichotomies (e.g., obedience vs. destruction). While rooted in religious discourse, its primary goal is not theological education but to provoke outrage and reinforce a dogmatic worldview by discrediting dissenters. The polemical tone, lack of nuanced discussion, and reliance on emotional manipulation align with propaganda’s core function of influencing perception through biased persuasion.
