### Final Verdict  
**Verdict – 85% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs 12 of the 18 techniques analyzed, including core strategies like **appeal to fear** (divine judgment), **loaded language** (e.g., "sodomy," "hypocrites"), **black-and-white framing** (righteous vs. wicked), and **straw men** (misrepresenting modern Christians). It weaponizes scripture and historical narratives (Sodom and Gomorrah) to advance a dogmatic agenda, dismisses nuance via **thought-terminating clichés**, and exaggerates societal issues to provoke urgency. While rooted in religious discourse, its primary aim is to manipulate emotions (fear, outrage) and delegitimize dissent, aligning with propaganda’s function to persuade rather than inform. The 15% non-propaganda allowance reflects the use of legitimate biblical references, though these are leveraged selectively to serve the polemical goal.
