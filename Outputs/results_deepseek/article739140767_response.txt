Here is the analysis of the text using the provided propaganda techniques:

1. **Name calling** – No – The text uses factual labels ("gang member," "MS-503," "MS-13") without resorting to insulting epithets.  
2. **Repetition** – No – Key terms like "gang" or "MS-13" are mentioned but not excessively repeated for emphasis.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to promote an idea (e.g., no rallying cries or mottos).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – While MS-13 is described as "notorious for extreme violence," this is contextual background, not a direct call to fear alternatives (e.g., policies or groups).  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility occurs; the text states facts as determined by agents.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Descriptions (e.g., "extreme violence and bloodshed") align with widely documented MS-13 activities. His clean record is stated neutrally.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or loyalty are made.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Notorious for extreme violence and bloodshed" evokes strong negative emotions and stereotypes about MS-13, framing the gang as inherently barbaric.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt to link the subject or his actions to universally hated groups (e.g., Nazis).  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on the popularity of an idea or action to persuade.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No complex issue (e.g., immigration) is reduced to a single cause.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific (e.g., names, times, charges).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While Border Patrol agents are cited, their role is to report events, not to leverage authority as proof of a broader claim.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dilemmas are presented (e.g., no "us vs. them" simplification).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases (e.g., "common sense") are used to shut down discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All details (gang ties, immigration status) are directly relevant to the arrest.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented arguments are refuted.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy or deflection to other issues.  

**Verdict – 15%** – The text is primarily a straightforward news report detailing an arrest, citing specific facts (time, location, charges, lack of prior record). However, the inclusion of the emotionally charged phrase "notorious for extreme violence and bloodshed" about MS-13 constitutes **loaded language**, subtly framing the subject through association with a feared group. This slight sensationalism introduces a minor propagandistic element by appealing to stereotypes, but it does not dominate the text. The overall tone remains factual and avoids overt persuasion, exaggeration, or manipulation beyond this single instance. Thus, the likelihood of propaganda is low but not absent.
