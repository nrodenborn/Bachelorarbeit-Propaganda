**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict – 40% –**  
While the text is primarily a factual report of an ICE removal operation, it does employ some propaganda techniques, notably appeal to fear, loaded language, and appeal to authority. The emphasis on serious crimes committed by foreign nationals and the use of emotionally charged language may influence readers to view immigration enforcement more favorably or to fear undocumented immigrants. However, the text does not use the majority of propaganda techniques, and its primary function appears to be informational. Therefore, it is somewhat likely to be propaganda, but not overtly so.
