Name calling – No – The text uses descriptive terms like "arms dealer" and "drug traffickers" to describe the alleged activities, not as gratuitous insults.
Repetition – No – The message is not repeated; information is presented in a linear, factual manner.
Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases intended as slogans.
Appeal to fear – No – The text reports on a past event and does not attempt to instill fear to support a particular idea or action.
Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or entity; it cites official sources to support its claims.
Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text attributes the claim of the man being the "country's largest arms dealer" to the police, reporting their statement rather than making an unsubstantiated claim itself.
Flag-Waving – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or national identity in the text.
Loaded Language – No – While terms like "drug traffickers" can be emotive, they are used here in a descriptive, factual context to explain the nature of the crime.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to hated groups.
Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular and therefore should be accepted.
Causal Oversimplification – No – The text reports a police official's statement that the arrest dismantled the operation, but does not itself present a simplified cause for a complex problem.
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is specific, providing names, agencies, and details. It even clarifies what information is not yet available, which is a sign of clear reporting.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites Inspector Fabricio Oliveira of Rio de Janeiro’s police department and the Justice Ministry as sources for its information, using their authority as evidence for the claims made.
Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present a false dilemma or limit options to only two.
Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any clichés intended to stop discussion or critical thought.
Red herring – No – All the information presented is directly relevant to the arrest of the arms dealer.
Straw men – No – The text is a report, not an argument, and does not misrepresent or refute any opposing viewpoint.
Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing others of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 5% – The text is overwhelmingly a factual news report and not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the public about a law enforcement action. It follows standard journalistic practices, such as attributing information to specific, named sources (Inspector Fabricio Oliveira, the Justice Ministry, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement). The language is neutral and descriptive. The only technique present, "Appeal to authority," is used in the form of journalistic sourcing to lend credibility to the report, not as a logical fallacy to persuade the audience. The 5% likelihood accounts for the fact that any news, however factual, can be selected or framed to support a broader narrative, but based on the text alone, it shows virtually no characteristics of propaganda.
