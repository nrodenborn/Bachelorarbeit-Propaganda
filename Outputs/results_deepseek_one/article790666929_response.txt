### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Technique Use**: Employs 14/18 techniques (e.g., loaded language, whataboutism, name-calling) to manipulate perception.  
2. **Selective Framing**: Presents the Ellison case as a Democratic conspiracy ("lawless party," "Democrat machine") while omitting key facts:  
   - Courts legally approved unsealing Ryan’s records.  
   - No evidence links Obama to the unsealing.  
   - Ellison’s ex-wife opposes the release, calling it politically motivated.  
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses inflammatory labels ("corrupt," "dirty work") to evoke outrage rather than rational analysis.  
4. **False Equivalence**: Equates Obama’s 2004 race (opponent resigned over *confirmed* scandal) with Ellison’s (unproven allegations).  
5. **Omission of Context**: Fails to note divorce records are typically public, framing unsealing as uniquely malicious when legally routine.  
6. **Source Bias**: Poll repetition and phrases like "conservative group wants to probe" signal right-wing alignment, not neutrality.  

**Conclusion**: The text’s pervasive distortion of facts, reliance on emotional triggers, and deflection tactics align with propaganda objectives—aimed at discrediting Democrats/Ellison rather than informing. The 5% uncertainty reflects the inclusion of factual elements (e.g., Monahan’s allegations, Kim Ellison’s statement), though these are weaponized within a biased narrative.
