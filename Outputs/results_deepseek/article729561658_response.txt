Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No  
2. **Repetition** – No

3. **Slogans** – No  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
5. **Doubt** – No

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No  
8. **Loaded Language** – No

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
10. **Bandwagon** – No  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No  
    *(Details are specific and clear)*  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No  
    *(Authorities are cited for verification, not manipulation)*  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No  
16. **Red herring** – No  
17. **Straw men** – No

**Verdict – 5% –** The text reports a factual incident with documented evidence (emails, university actions). Its repetition of "Australia is a country" corrects misinformation rather than promoting an agenda. No emotional manipulation, false dilemmas, or distorted arguments are present. The 5% reflects minimal bias in phrases like "just so we're all clear," which mildly frames the professor's error as obvious, but this doesn't constitute systematic propaganda. Primary intent is informational, not persuasive.
