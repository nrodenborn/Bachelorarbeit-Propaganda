### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "prison for profit system" (insulting label for the federal prison system).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL") are used; the petition call is descriptive, not slogan-like.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – While injustice is implied, no explicit fear of alternatives (e.g., "if we don’t pardon them, worse will happen") is present.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "gross miscarriage of justice" questions the credibility of the legal system.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimization: "simply were doing their job" downplays the seriousness of their crimes (arson).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "Rural communities of the West are greatly appreciative of the efforts of the Trump administration" appeals to patriotism/regional identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "unmitigated 'terrorism' charges" (scare quotes imply injustice), "murder of LaVoy Finicum" (emotionally charged), and "humble ranchers" (positive stereotype).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "many in the West, and indeed across the nation" and "many of you followed these stories" emphasize popularity to sway readers.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Implies the Hammonds' trial directly caused the Malheur protest and Finicum’s death, ignoring broader context.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Language is clear; no deliberate obscurity.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authoritative figures or institutions are cited as evidence (only a petition and general public support).  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Portrays the Hammonds as innocent victims ("hard-working, family ranchers") versus a corrupt system ("blight on federal agencies"), ignoring nuances of their legal case.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "They are the furthest thing from terrorists" and "simply were doing their job" shut down critical analysis of their actions.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The poll asking "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" distracts from the pardon issue.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., "What about corrupt Democrats?" is a distraction but not a direct charge of hypocrisy).  

### Verdict:  
**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements, including emotional manipulation (loaded language, minimization), logical fallacies (black-and-white framing, bandwagon appeals), and distractions (repetition, red herring). It vilifies institutions ("prison for profit system"), oversimplifies events, and uses identity-based appeals (flag-waving) to rally support. While based on real events, the one-sided narrative, lack of factual counterpoints (e.g., details of the Hammonds' convictions), and inclusion of irrelevant content (Democrat poll) aim to provoke outrage rather than inform. This aligns with propaganda’s core function: advancing a specific agenda (pardons) by bypassing rational discourse.**
