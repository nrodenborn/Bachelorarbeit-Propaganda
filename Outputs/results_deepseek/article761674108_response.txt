Here is the analysis of the text using the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "summertime soldier" (referring to Corker), "Beltway elites," "Bush-McCain Republican establishment," "nativists" (attributed to the establishment's view of opponents).
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The phrase "open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism" (or variations like "free trade globalism and democracy-crusading") is repeated multiple times to hammer home the perceived failures of the establishment.
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – "Make China great again" (parody/reversal of "Make America Great Again"), "uncivil war".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "there will be a truly uncivil war in this country" (if the establishment tries to reimpose old policies after Trump).
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "How could the Beltway GOP not see...", "Could Republicans not see the factories shutting down, or not understand why workers' wages had failed to rise for decades?" (Raises doubt about the establishment's competence/perception).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – *Exaggeration:* "U.S. elites made China great again", "exporting our future", "Third World invasion" (describing immigration), "a Mideast awash in blood". *Minimization:* "U.S. politics have indeed been coarsened, with Trump playing a lead role" (downplays Trump's significant role in coarsening discourse).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "challenging our strategic position and presence in Asia", framing policies (trade, immigration, intervention) as harming America's interests and future.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "savagery", "blunders", "alienating", "derision", "waxed", "beatified", "conquest", "Suicide of a Superpower", "regime resting on top of all of us" (all evoke strong negative/positive emotions).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No clear comparison of opponents' ideas to Hitler/Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "Trump is president because he read the party and the country right", "Trump's brand of hard-edged nationalism... is taking root within his adopted party" (appeals to Trump's popularity/correct reading of the mood).
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes complex economic issues (trade deficits, manufacturing job losses, stagnant wages) and geopolitical outcomes (Middle East instability) *solely* to "Bushite free trade," "open borders," and "democracy crusades," ignoring other contributing factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The arguments, while strongly biased, are presented relatively clearly and specifically. Terms like "regime" are provocative but context makes the meaning clear (establishment power structure).
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – References to Barry Goldwater ("true profile in courage") and Ronald Reagan/Nixon ("to whom the future belonged") as conservative authorities whose mantle Trump supposedly carries, and the *New York Times* recognizing "Trump's triumph".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents the choice as Trumpism (good, representing the people/policy change) vs. the GOP establishment (bad, representing failed policies and elitism), with no viable middle ground or alternatives. "Be rid of the regime" implies only two sides.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "After the Trumpian revolt, there is no going back," "You can't go home again" (used to shut down consideration of a return to pre-Trump policies).
16. **Red herring** – No – The arguments, while one-sided, generally stick to criticizing the establishment and defending Trumpism on the core issues mentioned (trade, immigration, intervention). Critiques of Flake/Corker/Bush/McCain are directly relevant to the main argument.
17. **Straw men** – No – Criticizes actual policies and actions of the establishment (free trade agreements, immigration stance, Iraq war support) and quotes Flake's criticism of Trump. Doesn't significantly misrepresent their stated positions.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Focuses on criticizing the establishment's record. While contrasting it with Trump's perceived correctness, it doesn't primarily deflect criticism of Trump by accusing the establishment of hypocrisy *on the same specific point*.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a very high concentration of identifiable propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is not balanced analysis but to vehemently attack the Republican establishment (Flake, Corker, Bush, McCain) and passionately defend Trumpism using emotionally charged language (Loaded Language, Name Calling), appeals to nationalism and fear (Flag-Waving, Appeal to Fear), simplification of complex issues (Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy), repetition of key negative phrases, and appeals to popularity and certain authorities (Bandwagon, Appeal to Authority). It employs slogans, thought-terminating clichés, exaggeration, and minimization to bolster its one-sided argument. While based on real events and policies, the presentation is overwhelmingly manipulative and persuasive rather than informative and objective, aiming to solidify support for Trump and delegitimize his internal Republican critics. The concluding self-promotion of the author's books further aligns with a persuasive agenda.
