Based on the definitions provided and the text "Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government," here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used to attack any subject within the text. Descriptions like "anti-Semitic allegations" report claims, but are not used as direct attacks by the author.
2.  **Repetition** – No – There is no noticeable repetition of a specific phrase or message designed to hammer it home. The text reports events sequentially.
3.  **Slogans** – No – The text does not employ any brief, memorable phrases designed to rally support for a specific viewpoint (e.g., no chants or rallying cries are created or promoted within the article).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the topic involves anti-Semitism, the text reports on concerns and incidents rather than actively using fear to push a specific agenda or action against alternatives. It presents statements from involved parties without instilling fear itself.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not specifically question the credibility of any person or institution involved. It reports findings, clarifications, and differing perspectives without casting doubt in a targeted way.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text reports events, statements, and findings (like Boudreau's report and clarification) without apparent exaggeration or minimization. It presents perspectives from Lew, Jewish groups, and Fortier relatively neutrally.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, national identity, or a broad group identity (like "all students" or "all Jews") to support a viewpoint within the text. The focus is specific to McGill and the student government incident.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is primarily factual and reportorial. While terms like "anti-Semitic allegations," "targeted," and "profoundly disturbing" carry emotional weight, they are used to describe reported events, perspectives, and findings rather than to manipulate the reader's emotions unduly or invoke stereotypes. The author describes rather than emotes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There are no comparisons made to Nazis, fascists, or other universally despised groups to disapprove of an idea or group within the text. The Vichy reference is absent.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea to support it. It mentions groups (Jewish groups, Democratize SSMU) and their actions/views but doesn't argue that something should be believed or done *because* it's popular.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text presents the situation as complex. The report explicitly states the difficulty in determining motivation ("could not determine if... anti-Semitic intentions"), acknowledges "anti-Semitic effects," and mentions various contributing factors (Facebook language, prior incidents like the tweet, allegations of corruption/favoritism). It doesn't reduce the cause to one simple factor.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific. It details events, quotes individuals, explains the report's findings and subsequent clarification, and names groups and individuals involved. There is no deliberate use of unclear language to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While authorities are quoted (Boudreau, Lew, Fortier, Poupko), their statements are presented as their perspectives or findings within the context of the events, not as unquestionable evidence designed to shut down debate. The report itself is presented as an investigation with limitations.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents nuances. Boudreau's report couldn't confirm intent but acknowledged effects. Lew feels vindicated "to some extent" but says it's "not over." Poupko notes McGill is generally safe but activism can be disturbing. It avoids presenting only two absolute choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – The text does not employ simplistic phrases to discourage critical thought. It reports on complex issues, differing viewpoints, and ongoing processes (like the committee).
16. **Red herring** – No – The text remains focused on the core issue of the vote, the allegations of anti-Semitism, the report, reactions, and related incidents (like the tweet). No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text accurately reports the positions and statements of the individuals and groups involved (Boudreau's findings, Lew's reaction, Jewish groups' criticism, Democratize SSMU's actions, Fortier's statement, Poupko's view). No misrepresented arguments are set up to be knocked down.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge any opponent with hypocrisy. It focuses solely on the events and statements related to the McGill student government incident.

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is overwhelmingly a straightforward news report detailing an incident at McGill University, the investigation into it, the reactions from involved parties, and related context. It presents multiple perspectives (Lew, Boudreau, Jewish groups, Fortier, Poupko) and reports on facts and statements without apparent distortion. The language is neutral and journalistic, focusing on reporting events ("said," "concluded," "reported," "alleging") rather than persuading or manipulating the reader. While the *subject matter* (anti-Semitism) is highly charged and the *actions reported* (like the "punch a zionist" tweet) could be used propagandistically elsewhere, the *text itself* functions as objective reporting. The minimal likelihood (5%) acknowledges that any reporting on sensitive topics could be perceived through a partisan lens or used by others as propaganda, but the text's construction and presentation align with standard journalistic practice, not propaganda techniques.
