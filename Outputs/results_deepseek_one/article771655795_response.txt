Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis of the text "Gun Control Is Now Truly Impossible" for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "wannabe statist dictator", "naive do-gooder". These are insulting labels applied to proponents of gun control.
2.  **Repetition – No** – No specific phrase or message is repeated insistently throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans – No** – While "Defend Yourself" appears as a book title/advertisement, it's not used as a brief, memorable phrase driving the propaganda message itself. "Gun Control Is Now Truly Impossible" functions more as a headline/claim than a slogan within the text's argument.
4.  **Appeal to fear – No** – While the text implies government overreach ("The law caught up", threat of prosecution), it doesn't primarily use fear of alternatives (like the consequences of *not* having downloadable guns) to support its core argument about the ruling making gun control impossible. The fear is more of a past obstacle overcome.
5.  **Doubt – No** – The text doesn't primarily question the credibility of specific opponents or institutions regarding this specific ruling. It portrays the government as an adversary but doesn't cast doubt on their statements *about this settlement*.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – "Gun control is now truly impossible" and "virtually impossible" are significant exaggerations of the impact of the ruling, which specifically relates to publishing *digital files* online for export control purposes, not all forms of gun control.
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Heavy reliance on concepts like "radical libertarian", "anarchist video manifesto", "right to bear arms", "right to freely share information", "Second Amendment", "First Amendment", "constitutional contradictions". This appeals strongly to a specific American identity centered on libertarian ideals, individual rights, and opposition to government restriction.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Numerous examples: "wannabe statist dictator", "naive do-gooder", "hold hands, and sing Kumbaya" (mocking), "tyrant", "radical libertarian", "anarchist video manifesto", "dropping out of law school... as if to confirm his belief that technology supersedes law" (romanticizing rebellion), "The law caught up" (implying persecution), "simply for having made the file available", "I thought my life was over", "surrenders to that argument", "truly grand thing", "irrevocable part of political life". These words/phrases carry strong emotional connotations and value judgments.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparison to Nazis, Hitler, or universally hated groups is made to disapprove of gun control or its supporters.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – The text doesn't appeal to the popularity of downloadable guns or the ruling's acceptance to convince the audience. It focuses on the legal victory and principle.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – No** – The text doesn't attribute a complex problem (gun control effectiveness) to a single, simple cause. It presents the ruling as a significant *obstacle* to one aspect (controlling information/digital files), not the sole cause of impossibility.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The core claims about the ruling and its implications, while arguably exaggerated, are stated relatively clearly. The description of the legal process and settlement is specific.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – The narrative heavily relies on Cody Wilson as the protagonist and authority figure ("Wilson explained", "Wilson says", "He’d launched", "Wilson made the decision"). His perspective and quotes are used as evidence and validation of the significance of the event. The settlement from the DOJ is also presented as authoritative confirmation of his argument's strength ("essentially surrenders to that argument").
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – "Gun control is the dream of every wannabe statist dictator and naive do-gooder alike." This presents only two extreme, negative motivations for supporting gun control, ignoring any potential nuanced or safety-based reasons.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "hold hands, and sing Kumbaya" is used to dismiss the motivations and arguments of "naive do-gooders" without engaging with them seriously, discouraging critical thought about their perspective. Phrases like "technology supersedes law" and "an irrevocable part of political life" also function as definitive, conversation-ending pronouncements.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – The embedded book advertisements ("Defend Yourself: A Com...", "Straight Talk on Armed...") are irrelevant material that distracts from the main text.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – The characterization of the "naive do-gooder" belief ("removing guns will suddenly force humanity to stop all animosity toward one another, hold hands, and sing Kumbaya") is an extreme misrepresentation (a straw man) of common arguments for gun control focused on reducing violence or accidents, which are then easily dismissed.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The text doesn't charge opponents of downloadable guns (like the State Department) with hypocrisy regarding their own actions.

**Verdict – 60% –** The text exhibits several clear propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Exaggeration, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating clichés, Red Herring, Straw Men). These techniques are used to frame the narrative strongly in favor of Cody Wilson and the idea that downloadable guns are an irreversible victory for liberty, while demonizing and oversimplifying opposing viewpoints. The inclusion of advertisements also suggests a promotional purpose. However, the text is also grounded in reporting a specific real event (the lawsuit settlement) and explaining its legal arguments and implications. This factual core prevents it from being purely propaganda, but the pervasive use of persuasive techniques to frame the facts and dismiss alternatives pushes it significantly towards propaganda.
