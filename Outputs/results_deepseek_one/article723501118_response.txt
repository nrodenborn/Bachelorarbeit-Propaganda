Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text "We Should Be More Like Sweden: Gov May Use Army Against Immigrant Gangs":

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "hopeless hellhole", "refugee war criminals and terrorists", "bureaucrats with badges".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The phrase "more like Sweden" is repeated multiple times ("Progressives say we should be more like Sweden", "Maybe we should be more like Sweden?", "We Should Be More Like Sweden").
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – The title and repeated phrase "We Should Be More Like Sweden" acts as a brief, memorable phrase framing the argument.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Descriptions like "terrorized by warring foreign gangs", "deadly shootings", "picking up a hand grenade", "gun violence claimed the lives of 11 people" instill fear about immigration and crime.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Of course they can't cope" casts doubt on the Swedish police's ability. "Why would anyone associate rising crime and immigration?" casts doubt on the validity of the link (while ironically presenting evidence for it).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "hopeless hellhole", "Demolition Man in real life", "terrorized", "war criminals and terrorists" are exaggerated descriptions. Minimization is less prominent, but "Just one of those Danish gangs led by a fellow named Khan" downplays the gang's nature.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While implicitly favoring the author's view of how the *author's* country should *not* be, there is no explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity for the reader.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "hopeless hellhole", "overtaxed", "terrorized", "warring foreign gangs", "war criminals and terrorists", "Demolition Man", "bureaucrats with badges", "Mass repression", "Grenade Amnesty".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis or Hitler-era groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text doesn't argue that an idea is correct *because* it's popular. It opposes the "more like Sweden" idea held by "Progressives".
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Heavily implies (and at points states outright) that immigration is the primary or sole cause of rising gang violence ("Why would anyone associate rising crime and immigration? Maybe because the gangs in question are immigrant gangs.").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The arguments and language, while biased, are generally direct and clear in their intent. Terms like "Mass repression" are loaded but not intentionally vague.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – No authoritative sources or figures are cited to support the author's core arguments against immigration or the state of Sweden. Quotes from Lofven are reported but used critically.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as essentially a choice between being a "hopeless hellhole" terrorized by immigrants or taking drastic military/police action ("sending in the army", "mass repression") and cutting immigration. Nuance is absent.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "That tells you everything" is used to shut down discussion after mentioning bringing in the military is prioritized over cutting migration.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The detailed discussion of "Loyal to Familia" gang expansion from Denmark, while factually related to crime, distracts from the core argument about immigration policy being the root cause and solution. The "Grenade Amnesty" mention also serves this distracting purpose.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Sets up a weak representation of the "more like Sweden" argument ("hopeless hellhole... terrorized by warring foreign gangs") that is easily knocked down, rather than engaging with the actual policies or societal model progressives might admire.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not charge its opponents (progressives advocating being like Sweden) with hypocrisy regarding another issue.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating clichés, Red Herring, Straw Men). Its core purpose is not to objectively inform but to instill fear, create a strong negative association between immigration and violent crime, discredit opposing viewpoints ("Progressives"), and advocate for drastic, authoritarian solutions (military, repression, cutting immigration) by presenting a simplistic, emotionally charged, and heavily biased narrative. The language is inflammatory, relies on stereotypes, dismisses complexity, and distorts the situation in Sweden to serve a specific political agenda against immigration and progressive ideals. While it uses some factual events (shootings, Lofven's statement, gang expansion), these are framed overwhelmingly through the lens of propaganda techniques to manipulate the reader's perception and emotions.
