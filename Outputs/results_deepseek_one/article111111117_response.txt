Based on the definitions provided and the text "Trump formally nominates Gina Haspel to be next CIA director," here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against Haspel, her critics, or others. The text is factual and neutral.
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific message or phrase is repeated excessively to drive it home.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable rallying cries like "BUILD THE WALL!" used in the text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While Haspel's role in "detention and harsh interrogation" is mentioned as a reason for opposition, the text itself does not use this to instill fear or argue *for* her nomination by scaring the audience about alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not actively question the credibility of Haspel, Trump, her critics, or the process. It reports facts and stated opposition.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The descriptions ("formal paperwork," "delay," "longer than expected," "harsh interrogation") are matter-of-fact and not obviously exaggerated or minimized for effect.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There are no appeals to patriotism, national identity, or phrases like "We the People" to bolster the nomination or attack critics.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – Language like "detention and harsh interrogation" is descriptive and factual within this context. While "harsh interrogation" has negative connotations, it's a standard term for the program and isn't paired with overtly emotional or stereotypical language (e.g., "torture-loving," "sadistic").
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There are no comparisons of Haspel, her supporters, or her critics to Nazis, fascists, or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text doesn't argue for or against Haspel's nomination by claiming it's popular or gaining widespread support (or that opposition is widespread). It neutrally reports *some* opposition exists.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The delay is explained with multiple factors ("Logistical issues, including an FBI background check that took longer than expected"). It doesn't attribute the delay to a single, simplistic cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and direct. Terms like "logistical issues" and "harsh interrogation" are standard journalistic phrasing and not deliberately obscure or confusing in this context.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authority figure is cited to endorse Haspel or the nomination process. The anonymous official explains the reason for the delay factually, not to lend authority to an argument.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents multiple facets: the nomination, the delay, the reason for the delay, the opposition and its reason, and the upcoming process. No false dichotomy (only two choices) is presented.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down discussion (e.g., "That's just the way it is," "America First," "Trust the plan"). The text reports information objectively.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the topic of Haspel's nomination, the delay, and the reasons for opposition. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text reports the actual stated reasons for opposition ("her role in the CIA’s detention and harsh interrogation of terror suspects after 9/11"). It does not misrepresent or refute a weaker, non-existent argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No one in the text charges an opponent with hypocrisy to deflect criticism (e.g., "Why are you criticizing Haspel when [other event/person] did something worse?").

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is overwhelmingly a straightforward, factual news report detailing the formal nomination of Gina Haspel, the reason for a procedural delay, and the basis for opposition from some lawmakers and human rights groups. It lacks the hallmarks of propaganda: it does not employ emotional manipulation, deceptive reasoning, misleading framing, or overt persuasion techniques to promote a specific agenda regarding Haspel's nomination. The language is neutral and informative. The 5% acknowledges the inherent potential for subtle bias in any reporting (e.g., the choice to highlight the "harsh interrogation" opposition), but this falls far short of constituting propaganda as defined by the listed techniques. It primarily serves an informational purpose.
