1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Islam as a "totalitarian, religious/political construct that is full of oppression" and refers to the prophet Muhammad as a "desert nomad" in a derogatory context. It also labels individuals as "radicals" and "Islamic jihadis."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text directly connects Muslims with a plot to "engage in mass school shootings" and mentions the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, aiming to instill fear of Islam and its followers.
5. Doubt – Yes – The author explicitly questions the mosque spokesman's claim that the incident was a "domestic situation" by stating, "That's hardly a 'domestic situation.'"
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text makes the sweeping exaggeration that "the history of Islam is anything but nice, polite, just or holy" and is a "totalitarian, religious/political construct."
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like "Islamic jihadis," "terrible conditions," "third world," and "oppression" to evoke strong negative emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by associating it with a group like the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea. It argues against a perceived popular notion by saying, "People can continue to put their heads in the sand all they want to because they know 'nice' Muslim people..."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests that the suspects' alleged actions are the simple and direct result of being "devout Muslims" who "believe the Koran and follow in the footsteps of the desert nomad Muhammad," which is a gross oversimplification of human motivation and religious interpretation.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The final sentence, "Justice should be served swift, and I don't mean a lengthy jail term," is intentionally vague but strongly implies a call for the death penalty or extrajudicial violence without explicitly stating it.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites "Fox News," "the Associated Press," and the "Atlanta Constitution-Journal" to lend credibility to its claims about the weapons training.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false choice between being a "nice" Muslim (implying one who is not truly following the faith) and a "devout" Muslim who is inherently dangerous and totalitarian, ignoring all other possibilities.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "People can continue to put their heads in the sand all they want to" is used to shut down any nuanced discussion or counter-argument by labeling it as willful ignorance.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh is completely unrelated to the article's topic and serves as an irrelevant distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text sets up and attacks a straw man argument: "People can continue to put their heads in the sand all they want to because they know 'nice' Muslim people..." It refutes the simplistic idea that knowing nice individuals from a group invalidates any threat from that group, an argument that was not presented.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a hostile and fearful view of an entire religion and its followers. It achieves this by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. The article uses a factual news story as a foundation but systematically layers it with loaded language ("Islamic jihadis"), appeals to fear (linking the events to school shootings and terrorism), and sweeping exaggerations ("the history of Islam is anything but nice"). It employs logical fallacies like causal oversimplification (devout belief = extremism) and the black & white fallacy (nice Muslim vs. devout/dangerous Muslim) to create a distorted and malicious argument. Furthermore, it uses structural tricks like a completely irrelevant red herring (the Kavanaugh poll) and thought-terminating clichés ("put their heads in the sand") to manipulate the reader and shut down critical thinking. The sheer number and blatant application of these techniques confirm that the text is not a piece of journalism or opinion, but a deliberate work of propaganda designed to demonize a group.
