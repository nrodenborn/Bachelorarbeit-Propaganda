1. Name calling – Yes – The headline uses the insulting label “Illegal Alien Wife Beaters” to attack the subjects of the article.
2. Repetition – Yes – The message that illegal immigrants who were protected by the mayor are dangerous criminals is repeated through multiple examples of subsequent arrests for crimes like spousal abuse, robbery, and DUIs.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase “Sanctuary cities are the real war on women” is a brief and memorable phrase used to frame the issue.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text supports its position against sanctuary cities by highlighting dangerous crimes like “robbery and spousal abuse,” “gun crimes,” and “corporal injury of a spouse,” suggesting that these policies put the public in danger.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and judgment of Mayor Schaaf by linking her actions directly to the escape and subsequent re-arrest of criminals, framing her as promoting a "radical, open borders agenda."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The statement “Sanctuary cities are the real war on women” is an exaggeration, equating a policy disagreement with a "war." The claim that "hundreds more escaped" also serves to exaggerate the negative impact of the mayor's actions.
7. Flag-Waving – No – While the text involves federal authorities and national issues, it does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity. The primary appeal is to fear and safety.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “Illegal Alien Wife Beaters,” “war on women,” and “radical, open borders agenda” to appeal to the audience's emotions and stereotypes.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest that the idea is popular with hated groups like Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text implies a simple cause-and-effect: Mayor Schaaf’s warning directly led to specific individuals committing new crimes. This simplifies the complex issues of immigration, crime, and sanctuary policies.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and messaging, not deliberately vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and cites “ICE officials” to support its claims and lend them credibility.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a choice between supporting Mayor Schaaf's "radical, open borders agenda" which protects criminals, or supporting federal law enforcement and public safety, ignoring any potential nuanced positions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The slogan “Sanctuary cities are the real war on women” acts as a thought-terminating cliché, designed to shut down nuanced discussion by framing opposition as being anti-woman.
16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central argument and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the audience.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a position that supporters of sanctuary cities do not hold. It characterizes their stance as a “radical, open borders agenda” that condones criminality, which is a distorted and easily attackable version of their actual arguments.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The phrase “Sanctuary cities are the real war on women. And Democrats are the ones fighting it” is a form of whataboutism. It deflects criticism and accuses the opposing side (Democrats, who have used the "war on women" phrase) of the very thing they have accused others of.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it reports on factual events (a warning was issued, and arrests were made), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade through emotional manipulation and logical fallacies. The text employs a vast number of propaganda techniques to achieve its goal. It begins with inflammatory Name-calling in the headline and uses Loaded Language ("radical") and Appeals to Fear (listing violent crimes) throughout to create a strong emotional response. It establishes a simple, misleading narrative through Causal Oversimplification (Schaaf's warning = new crimes) and a Black & White Fallacy (you are either with law and order or you protect criminals). It attacks a distorted version of its opponents' arguments (Straw Man) and uses Whataboutism to charge them with hypocrisy. The use of a Slogan ("the real war on women") and an Appeal to Authority (quoting the Attorney General) further reinforces its one-sided message. The sheer density of these techniques indicates a deliberate effort to bypass critical thought and promote a specific, highly biased viewpoint.
