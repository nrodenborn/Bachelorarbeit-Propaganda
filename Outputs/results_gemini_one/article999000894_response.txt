1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly labels the group of migrants as an “invasion,” which is an insulting and aggressive label. Example: "Thousands of Troops and Razor Wire: US Border Reinforced Against Migrant ‘Invasion’ (Videos)" and "prepare to repel what the country’s commander-in-chief called a looming migrant “invasion”".
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the message of a military-style reinforcement and the threat of the caravan. The poll about Jim Acosta is also repeated three times verbatim. Example: "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back? Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back? Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?"
3. Slogans – No – While the text mentions "Operation Faithful Patriot," it is used as a name for a military operation, not as a recurring, memorable phrase meant to be chanted or used as a rallying cry.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses words and imagery to instill fear of the migrants, describing them as an "invasion" that will "overtake the border" and must be repelled with "thousands of US troops," "razor-sharp fence," and potentially "brutal force."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text directly questions the credibility of anyone who disagrees with its premise. Example: "Anyone who doubts this is an invasion only need look at the size of the caravan and those that make up the majority of those marching towards our border."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the threat by calling the caravan an "invasion" and comparing the troop deployment to numbers in active war zones like Afghanistan. It also minimizes the presence of families by stating, "They are predominantly young men, there are few woman and children," a claim which is later contradicted.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by naming the military deployment "Operation Faithful Patriot" and framing the military's actions as protecting "our border."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to influence the reader's opinion. Examples include "invasion," "repel," "overtake," "potential illegals," and Trump's quote about the "beautiful sight" of "barbed wire."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular. It relies on authority and fear rather than appealing to a sense of popular consensus.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents the complex issue of mass migration as a simple problem of an "invasion" that requires a simple military solution, ignoring the multifaceted socioeconomic and political reasons people are migrating.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text is intentionally vague and contradictory about the caravan's makeup. It first claims it is "predominantly young men" to heighten the threat, but later states the groups are "mainly families," and also admits "the US still has very little intel about the composition of the migrant caravans." This creates confusion while pushing a specific narrative.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the statements of President Trump, the Pentagon, and the head of the Northern Command to lend credibility to the military response and the "invasion" narrative. Example: "“We have enough concertina wire to cover up to 22 miles already deployed...“ the head of the Northern Command, Terrence O’Shaughnessy told reporters".
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as having only two outcomes: either the US military fortifies the border, or the nation will be subjected to an "invasion." It ignores other potential responses, such as processing asylum claims or diplomatic options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common cliché phrases to shut down discussion.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll that is completely irrelevant to the article's topic. Example: "take our poll - story continues below Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" This serves to distract the reader from the main content.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an unstated argument. By insisting "Anyone who doubts this is an invasion...", it sets up and attacks the straw man position that the caravan is completely harmless, rather than engaging with nuanced arguments about asylum law or humanitarian concerns.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an opponent by accusing them of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast majority (13 out of 18) of the listed techniques to achieve its goal, which is not to inform but to persuade the reader to view a group of migrants as a hostile, invading force that necessitates a strong military response. The piece uses highly emotional and loaded language (Name calling, Appeal to fear, Loaded Language), relies on logical fallacies (Straw men, Black & white fallacy, Causal Oversimplification), and leverages authority figures to validate its claims (Appeal to authority). Furthermore, it uses distracting and irrelevant material (Red herring) and directly attacks the credibility of any dissenting view (Doubt). The combination of these techniques creates a one-sided, fear-based narrative designed to manipulate public opinion rather than present a neutral, factual account of events.
