### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 85% – Explanation**  
The text is highly likely propaganda due to:  
1. **Systematic use of techniques**: It employs 12/18 analyzed propaganda methods (e.g., loaded language, name-calling, repetition) to discredit opponents (Guardian, Mueller, US/UK governments) and glorify Assange.  
2. **One-sided narrative**: Presents claims as absolute facts ("Those are the facts") while dismissing counter-evidence (e.g., dismissing DNC hack evidence via appeal to authority).  
3. **Emotional manipulation**: Uses fear ("state control of propaganda"), outrage ("deliberate lies"), and demonization ("MI6 mouthpiece") to provoke hostility toward media/governments.  
4. **Conspiracy framing**: Alleges coordinated collusion between media, security services, and governments to fabricate evidence and manipulate public opinion.  
5. **Purpose**: Aims to delegitimize critics, rally support for Assange, and advance a specific ideological view (media as "elite control").  
While it raises valid concerns about media integrity, its reliance on distortions, omissions (e.g., no proof of document forgery), and aggressive rhetoric aligns with propaganda objectives. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges potential factual elements (e.g., visitor log procedures), but these are overshadowed by manipulative techniques.
