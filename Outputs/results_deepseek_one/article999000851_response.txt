Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text uses "antics," "confrontations," and "misbehavior" as insulting labels to describe Jim Acosta's actions. (Example: "thanks to his antics and confrontations... due to his misbehavior").
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrase is used as a slogan to encapsulate the message.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – Explanation: The text outlines consequences for rule-breaking (suspension/revocation of passes) but does not instill fear against *other alternatives* to support its core message about Acosta or the rules.
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not explicitly question the credibility of a person or institution using phrasing like "can it be trusted?" or "is this reliable?".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: The description "physically prevented a White House intern from taking the microphone" arguably exaggerates the nature of the brief contact during the microphone incident. The phrase "lost the war" minimizes the significance of CNN's legal victory by framing the new rules as a greater, permanent loss.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: There are no appeals to patriotism, national identity, or unifying concepts like "We the People" within this specific text.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Words like "antics," "confrontations," "misbehavior," and "physically prevented" carry strong negative connotations, appealing to emotions and reinforcing a negative view of Acosta's actions. "Backing down" is also loaded language framing the White House action negatively.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: There are no comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or universally hated groups like the Vichy regime to disapprove of an idea.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: While it mentions other media outlets celebrating and joining the lawsuit, it does not use this popularity to explicitly argue *for* or *against* a specific action or idea (e.g., "Join everyone else and support X").
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text attributes the new rules to Acosta's actions ("thanks to his antics...", "given the position taken by CNN"), which is a direct causal claim, but it doesn't present this as the *sole, simple cause* for a significantly more complex event. The connection presented is plausible and direct within the context.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The rules ("a single question," "follow-ups solely at the discretion," "failure to obey") and the consequences are stated clearly, not obscured or made vague.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: While Sanders and Shine (authorities) are quoted stating the rules, their statements are presented as factual announcements of policy, not as evidence used to prove a separate claim's validity. The RT report mention is a source citation, not an appeal to its authority as proof.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: The text presents the situation with nuances – the pass is restored *but* with new rules, CNN won the legal battle *but* might have "lost the war". It doesn't force a choice between only two extreme options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: There are no phrases like "it is what it is" or "that's just common sense" used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the Acosta incident, the lawsuit, the restoration of the pass, and the new rules. It does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text summarizes the White House position (rules due to Acosta's behavior) and the media reaction (celebrating victory, framing it as backing down) without misrepresenting or refuting a weaker version of an opposing argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not charge Acosta, CNN, or the media with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions or inconsistencies.

**Verdict – 40% – Explanation:** The text exhibits several clear propaganda techniques, most notably **Name Calling** ("antics," "confrontations," "misbehavior"), **Repetition** (of the poll question), **Loaded Language** (the terms used for Acosta's actions, "backing down," "lost the war"), and arguably **Exaggeration/Minimization** ("physically prevented," minimizing the legal win as "lost the war"). These techniques create a distinctly negative framing of Jim Acosta's role and subtly downplay the significance of CNN's legal victory while emphasizing the negative consequences (new rules) attributed to him. However, the text also reports factual developments (pass restoration, new rules, lawsuit dropped, media reaction) and includes direct quotes. It doesn't rely *solely* on propaganda techniques; the core news event is present. The significant use of negative labeling and framing pushes it towards propaganda, but the inclusion of verifiable facts and the lack of more extreme techniques (like fear-mongering, false dichotomies, or blatant obfuscation) prevents it from being overwhelmingly propagandistic. Therefore, a 40% likelihood reflects that while propaganda techniques are employed to shape the narrative against Acosta and imply a pyrrhic victory for CNN, the piece is still grounded in reportable events.
