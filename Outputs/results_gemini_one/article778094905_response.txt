1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses the label "Islamic jihadi camps" to associate the religion of Islam with terrorism. It also uses President Obama’s full name, "Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah," as a way to cast him as foreign and illegitimate.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases that function as a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear with statements like, "He was attempting to brainwash and train these kids to carry out school shootings" and "...at least 22 verified Islamic jihadi camps have existed on American soil... within eyeshot of a nuclear power plant."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and competence of the FBI by stating the camps existed "under the watchful, or maybe not so watchful, eye of the FBI".
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the scale of the threat by claiming, without sourcing, that "at least 22 verified Islamic jihadi camps have existed on American soil" to create a sense of widespread danger.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national identity by highlighting that the events are happening on "American soil" and rhetorically asking what "Americans" should feel about it.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical phrases such as "Islamic compound," "brainwash," and "Islamic jihadi camps" to shape the reader's perception.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is popular or that the reader should join the majority opinion.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text implies that the complex issue of domestic terrorism is caused by a single factor, stating, "Political correctness needs to be thrown out the window when dealing with those who take the Quran's teachings seriously..."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The claim about "at least 22 verified Islamic jihadi camps" is intentionally vague, as it offers no source or evidence for this number.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites credible news sources to establish the factual basis of the story before adding its own propagandistic spin. Example: "The Associated Press confirms the report: BREAKING: Court documents say man arrested at New Mexico compound was training children to commit school shootings."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false choice between keeping "political correctness" and being unsafe, or throwing it out to be safe, ignoring other options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "Political correctness needs to be thrown out the window" is a cliché used to discourage critical thought about a complex issue.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh ("Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?") is entirely unrelated to the story about the New Mexico compound and serves to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text creates and attacks a weak argument that was never made: "I mean, after all, Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah is out of office so these things aren't really going on in America, right?"
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not use the specific technique of charging an opponent with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it is built around a factual news event and cites legitimate authorities like the Associated Press to gain credibility, it systematically employs a vast number of propaganda techniques to frame the story in a way that promotes a specific political and ideological agenda. It uses loaded language, name-calling, and appeals to fear to create an emotional response against a specific group. It introduces a red herring (the Kavanaugh poll) to distract and engage the reader for other purposes. Furthermore, it uses logical fallacies like causal oversimplification, straw men, and the black & white fallacy to push a narrative that blames "political correctness" and a previous political administration for a complex problem. The combination of these techniques shows a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than to simply inform them.
