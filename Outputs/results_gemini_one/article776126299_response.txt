Name calling – Yes – The author calls the lawsuit "frivolous," states the judge is "not even fit to sit on the bench," and labels the opposing viewpoint as a "Communist ideology."

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times consecutively.

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – No – While the text uses strong language, its primary appeal is to constitutional rights and outrage, not to instilling fear of what will happen if the judge's order stands.

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and competence of the judge ("he is not even fit to sit on the bench") and President Trump ("Doesn't make much sense? Are you people serious?").

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the subject by referring to the gun plans simply as "computer files" and "printed material." It also uses exaggeration in its graphic and "barbaric" description of abortion to create an emotional contrast.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text repeatedly invokes the U.S. Constitution (First, Second, and Tenth Amendments) and contrasts an "American" ideology with a "Communist ideology" to appeal to patriotism.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases such as "brutal and barbaric fashion," "frivolous lawsuit," "usual suspects," and "Communist ideology."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of the state's argument by labeling it a "Communist ideology you are seeing there, not an American one," which is a group hated by the intended audience.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest the reader should agree because the idea is popular. In fact, it frames the issue as a fight against powerful state and federal actors.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies a complex legal issue by stating that because the plans are "printed material" (First Amendment) and relate to arms (Second Amendment), any attempt to block them is automatically unconstitutional, ignoring the complex legal arguments around public safety and export controls.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's position and arguments, while biased, are presented directly and are not intentionally vague or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites Fox News, Josh Blackman (a lawyer for Defense Distributed), and Cody Wilson as authorities. It also makes a broader appeal to the authority of the "founders" and the Constitution.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the issue as a binary choice between a "Communist ideology" that infringes on rights and an "American one" that upholds the Constitution, leaving no room for nuanced debate on regulation.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The assertion that the Attorney General is "reading something into it that is simply not there" is a dismissive phrase that attempts to end discussion. Similarly, labeling an idea as "Communist" serves to shut down critical thought about the idea itself.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the highly emotional and unrelated topic of abortion ("mothers hiring hitmen to murder their babies") to distract from the legal arguments about 3D-printed guns and to cast moral aspersion on the opponents. The poll about Brett Kavanaugh is also an irrelevant distraction.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a broad anti-gun, anti-First Amendment argument, while the states' actual quoted arguments are more specific and procedural, focusing on the Administrative Procedure Act and states' rights to regulate firearms.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text uses the issue of abortion as a form of whataboutism, implying the opponents' concern over 3D-printed guns is hypocritical: "It makes perfect sense when you have the same people who have absolutely no problem with mothers hiring hitmen to murder their babies..."

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform the reader objectively about a legal case, but to persuade them to adopt a specific, highly emotional viewpoint by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. While it reports some factual details of the case (the judge's name, the states involved), these facts serve as a scaffold for a powerful emotional and ideological argument.

The piece heavily relies on **Loaded Language** ("barbaric," "frivolous"), **Name Calling** ("Communist ideology," "not fit to sit on the bench"), and **Flag-Waving** (constant appeals to the Constitution and "American" values) to create a stark "us vs. them" narrative. The most blatant technique is the **Red Herring** of a long, graphic paragraph on abortion, which is a classic example of **Whataboutism** designed to distract from the core issue and incite outrage against the author's opponents. The arguments are built on a **Black & White Fallacy** (American freedom vs. Communist control) and **Causal Oversimplification** of complex legal matters. The sheer number and intensity of the propaganda techniques used throughout the text leave little doubt that its goal is manipulation rather than objective reporting.
