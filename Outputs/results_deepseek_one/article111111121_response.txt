Based on the definitions provided and the text about the Dallas police officer shooting, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to any subject in the text.
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to promote an idea.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text reports on a tragic event and procedural issues, but does not attempt to instill fear to support a specific idea or alternative.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The text explicitly states that the victim's family "has disputed her account" and includes reporting that "The delay raised questions about why investigators held off on arresting the officer and about whether law enforcement authorities were showing deferential treatment for one of their own." It also highlights contradictory explanations from the Police Chief.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text reports facts and statements (like the number of police killings, the timeline, the Chief's statements) without obvious exaggeration or minimization of events.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or national/group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is generally factual and neutral (e.g., "fatal shooting," "sparked criticism," "contradictory explanations"). While the event is inherently emotional, the reporting itself avoids overly charged words intended to provoke a strong emotional reaction beyond the facts presented.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or universally despised groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea to gain support.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text presents a complex situation (the shooting, the investigation, the disciplinary process) without attributing it to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – While the Police Chief's statements are described as contradictory and the reasons for the delay are questioned, the text itself reports these clearly and attributes the vagueness to the officials involved. The reporting is not deliberately unclear.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While authorities (Police Chief, The Post, Dallas Morning News) are cited for facts and statements, their support is not used *as evidence* for a specific claim beyond reporting what they said or did. The text actually questions the authorities' actions.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents a nuanced situation with multiple perspectives (Guyger's account vs. family's dispute, Police Chief's contradictory statements, legal questions about prosecution) and does not reduce the issue to only two simplistic options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is," "that's just the way things are").
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the events surrounding the shooting, the investigation, the disciplinary action, and the resulting criticism/questions. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text accurately reports the positions it discusses (Guyger's account, family's dispute, Chief's statements, media questions) without misrepresenting or refuting a weaker version of an argument not actually presented.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No one in the text is charged with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated actions or behaviors of others.

**Verdict – 0% –** The text is a straightforward news report detailing the factual events surrounding the fatal shooting by Officer Guyger, the subsequent investigation, disciplinary actions, and the criticism/questions raised about the police department's handling of the case. It presents multiple perspectives (official police statements, victim's family, media reporting) without employing emotionally manipulative language, oversimplification, misdirection, or the other defined propaganda techniques. The purpose appears to be informational reporting rather than persuasion through deceptive or emotionally charged means. The presence of "Doubt" (raising questions based on contradictions and disputes) is a standard and necessary function of journalism in holding power accountable and does not, in itself, constitute propaganda in this context.
