1. Name calling â€“ Yes â€“ The text quotes a tweet that refers to the shooter as a "Scumbag shooter".
2. Repetition â€“ Yes â€“ The text includes several tweets that repeat the same essential message: that a note was found and was being concealed. Examples include: "LEFT A NOTE", "The #StephenPaddock suicide note that the govt. is hiding from us", and "It appears the Las Vegas Shooter left a suicide note."
3. Slogans â€“ Yes â€“ The text quotes a tweet that uses the short, memorable, and accusatory phrase, "WHY IS MEDIA NOT REPORTING THIS?".
4. Appeal to fear â€“ No â€“ The text reports on a frightening event but does not use fear as a tool to support a particular idea or discredit an alternative.
5. Doubt â€“ Yes â€“ The text quotes tweets that are designed to create doubt about the credibility of official sources, such as "WHY IS MEDIA NOT REPORTING THIS?" and "The #StephenPaddock suicide note that the govt. is hiding from us."
6. Exaggeration/minimization â€“ No â€“ The text does not contain clear examples of exaggerating or minimizing facts to mislead the audience. It reports on speculation which was later proven false.
7. Flag-Waving â€“ Yes â€“ The text quotes a tweet from a user ("Michael ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸") who uses an American flag emoji to appeal to patriotism, and another from a user ("STUMP 4 TRUMP") whose name appeals to a specific political identity.
8. Loaded Language â€“ Yes â€“ The text quotes a tweet that uses the emotionally charged term "Scumbag shooter".
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum â€“ No â€“ The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other universally hated groups.
10. Bandwagon â€“ Yes â€“ The text creates a sense of widespread belief by stating that photos were "shared by millions of people on social media" and that "Twitter was abuzz with chatter".
11. Causal Oversimplification â€“ No â€“ The text avoids oversimplification by explaining the complex reality behind the initial speculation and explicitly states that the shooter's motives remain unclear.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness â€“ No â€“ The text's purpose is to clarify information (what was on the note) rather than to intentionally confuse the reader with vague language.
13. Appeal to authority â€“ No â€“ While the text cites official sources like the police, this is a standard component of journalistic reporting to provide evidence, not a fallacious technique to shut down debate.
14. Black & white fallacy â€“ No â€“ The text does not present a false dichotomy. In fact, it debunks one by revealing that the note was neither a suicide letter nor unimportant, but rather a set of calculations.
15. Thought-terminating clichÃ©s â€“ No â€“ The text does not use any phrases or clichÃ©s intended to discourage critical thought.
16. Red herring â€“ Yes â€“ After resolving the central question about the note, the article immediately introduces new, unresolved topics ("mystery woman," "accomplice") which distract from the debunked conspiracy and pivot the reader's attention to new speculation.
17. Straw men â€“ No â€“ The text addresses a real point of public speculation (that the paper was a suicide note) and refutes it with evidence, rather than creating a false argument to attack.
18. Whataboutism â€“ No â€“ The text does not attempt to deflect from the topic by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict â€“ 65% â€“ The text is a news article that uses a propagandistic framework to deliver information. While it does contain factual reporting that ultimately debunks a conspiracy theory, its structure and content choices are designed to amplify that same conspiracy for engagement. The headline focuses on the debunked theory ("'Suicide Note' Seen..."), and the body of the text prominently features tweets containing propaganda techniques like Name-Calling, Doubt, and Flag-Waving. By framing the story around "conspiracies" and "rumors" and then pivoting to new "mysteries" after solving the first one, the article promotes a narrative of suspicion and cover-up. Its primary effect is not simply to inform, but to attract and engage readers through controversy, thereby acting as a vehicle for propaganda even while reporting facts.
