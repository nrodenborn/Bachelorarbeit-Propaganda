Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "ridiculous courses," "toxic stew of racism," "meaningless jargon," "sociology stupidity." These are insulting labels applied to sociology and related courses.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: While the Australia issue is mentioned several times, it's part of the narrative, not the deliberate repetition of a specific phrase or slogan for emphasis.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrase is used as a slogan to encapsulate the message.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text instills fear about sociology corrupting academia ("helped generate a whole range of fake new academic subjects while corrupting existing ones"), creating a "toxic stew," and resulting in "sociology stupidity," implying dangerous outcomes if sociology is not viewed skeptically.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text consistently questions the credibility of sociology ("You really don't need to know anything"), its courses ("ridiculous"), its practitioners ("The professor, who has a PhD in philosophy... Of course she does"), and its academic rigor ("all you need is... absolute ignorance").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggeration is used heavily: "toxic stew of racism," "perfect storm of sociology stupidity," the implication that sociology courses universally require no real knowledge. The professor's PhD in philosophy is minimized with "Of course she does," implying it's irrelevant or expected in a negative way.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not appeal to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty (like "We the People") to support its argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Emotionally charged negative words are pervasive: "ridiculous," "fake," "corrupting," "toxic stew," "racism," "meaningless jargon," "absolute ignorance," "stupidity," "shocked," "failed," "zero or partial credit," "oppression."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: There is no attempt to link sociology, the professor, or the student to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally despised groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not argue that sociology is bad because it's unpopular or that the author's view is correct because it's popular. It takes a contrarian stance against sociology.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text blames sociology alone for complex problems: "Sociology helped generate a whole range of fake new academic subjects while corrupting existing ones." It oversimplifies the cause of perceived issues in academia.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The author is quite direct and clear in their criticism and narrative. The professor's final email ("Who can really say?") could be seen as vague, but it's presented as an example of the problem, not the author's own technique.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: The student (and author by inclusion) cites the "research starter on the SNHU’s Shapiro library written by John Pearson (2013)" as evidence that Australia is a country, appealing to this source as an authority to refute the professor.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text presents sociology in starkly negative terms as wholly corrupt and producing only "stupidity," implying there are no valid aspects to the discipline. The "My truth" comment also implies a false dichotomy between objective facts and subjective belief.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Phrases like "Sociology stupidity," "You really don't need to know anything," and the sarcastic "Of course she does" are used to dismiss sociology and the professor's credentials without substantive discussion, discouraging critical engagement.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The core narrative about the student's project and the criticism of sociology are directly related. The author doesn't introduce a significantly distracting, irrelevant topic.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text misrepresents the professor's position. The professor's email ("After I do some independent research... I will review your paper") shows she is reconsidering, not definitively sticking to her initial error. The author presents her as entrenched in absurdity ("Who can really say?").
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not charge an opponent with hypocrisy by pointing to their unrelated flaws. It focuses on criticizing sociology and this specific incident.

**Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation:** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to neutrally report an incident but to vehemently attack the academic discipline of sociology using multiple, sustained propaganda techniques. Key indicators include:
*   **Heavy Use of Loaded Language & Name-Calling:** Words like "ridiculous," "fake," "toxic stew," "racism," "stupidity," and "ignorance" permeate the text, creating a uniformly negative and emotionally charged portrayal.
*   **Exaggeration & Minimization:** The flaws of sociology and the professor are grossly exaggerated ("perfect storm of stupidity," "corrupting existing ones"), while relevant context (e.g., the professor reconsidering) is minimized.
*   **Appeal to Fear & Doubt:** It instills fear about sociology's corrupting influence on academia and relentlessly sows doubt about its value, rigor, and practitioners' competence.
*   **Causal Oversimplification & Black & White Fallacy:** It blames sociology alone for complex issues in academia and presents the discipline in purely negative, simplistic terms.
*   **Thought-Terminating Clichés:** Uses dismissive phrases to shut down any potential counter-argument or nuance regarding sociology's value.
*   **Straw Man:** Misrepresents the professor's final position to make her (and by extension, sociology/academia) look more unreasonable.
*   **Narrative Framing:** The Ashley Arnold anecdote is used not as a standalone incident to explore, but primarily as a vehicle to launch the broader attack on sociology, framed by the author's opening and closing polemic. The author's voice dominates, interpreting events solely to support the anti-sociology thesis.
While based on a real incident, the presentation is heavily slanted, emotionally manipulative, and employs numerous techniques designed to persuade the reader to adopt a highly negative view of sociology rather than to inform objectively. The lack of balance, overwhelming negativity, and consistent use of persuasive (rather than purely informative) techniques make it strongly indicative of propaganda.
