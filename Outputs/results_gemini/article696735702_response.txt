1. Name calling – No – The text criticizes groups like "law enforcement and the mainstream media" but does not use insulting labels to attack them.
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the official story is incorrect or changing is repeated throughout the text. For example: "the entire official narrative... is falling apart," "constantly changing story," and "calls the entirety official story into question."
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text aims to create distrust and suspicion, not to instill fear in the reader about alternatives to its own viewpoint.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to question the credibility of the official investigation. For example: "everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of the timeline change by stating "the entire official narrative... is falling apart," which is a dramatic overstatement of a revised timeline in an active investigation.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make any appeals to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader’s perception. For example: "massacre," "falling apart," and "constantly changing story" evoke feelings of chaos, conspiracy, and incompetence.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparison to groups hated by the audience, such as Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not claim that its viewpoint is popular or that "everyone" is starting to believe it.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not propose a simple cause for a complex event; rather, it argues that the official explanation is too simple and that the situation is more complex.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text is vague about its sources and evidence, creating suspicion without providing concrete proof. For example: "According to links and information shared by Thomas Wictor and a timeline assessment by Twitter user Mr. Alex..."
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites a Twitter user ("@drawandstrike theory looking plausible") as an authority to support its alternative theory, which is an appeal to a non-credible or questionable authority.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between two options: the "official narrative" (portrayed as a single, collapsing story) and the alternative, conspiratorial view. It ignores the possibility of a complex investigation with natural corrections.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "It should be clear by now that..." is used to present a premise as an undeniable fact, discouraging the reader from questioning whether the official narrative is actually "falling apart."
16. Red herring – Yes – The text briefly introduces "possible connections to a terrorist organization" but never develops the point, serving only to add another layer of unsupported suspicion and distract from the main argument about the timeline.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a straw man argument by treating the changing details of an active investigation as a sign of a deliberate cover-up, rather than the normal process of gathering and correcting information. It attacks the idea of a perfect, static initial report, which was never promised.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, conspiratorial viewpoint by discrediting official sources. This is achieved through a high concentration of propaganda techniques. The piece relentlessly employs **Doubt** to undermine "law enforcement and the mainstream media." It uses **Repetition** to hammer home the message that the official story is "falling apart." It constructs a **Straw Man** by framing the natural evolution of a complex investigation as a sign of deception. This is combined with a **Black & White Fallacy**, which forces the reader to choose between this supposedly flawed "official narrative" and the author's alternative theory. The argument is supported by **Loaded Language** to create an emotional atmosphere of suspicion and an **Appeal to Authority** that relies on non-expert social media users. The cumulative effect of these techniques is a highly manipulative piece designed to erode trust in established institutions and promote a specific, unsubstantiated narrative.
