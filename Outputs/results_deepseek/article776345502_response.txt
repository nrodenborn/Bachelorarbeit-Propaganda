### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs **at least 12 distinct propaganda techniques** (e.g., name-calling, repetition, loaded language) to delegitimize the Mueller investigation, emotionally manipulate readers, and shield Trump from scrutiny. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotive language and demonization**: Insults like "17 Angry Democrats," "disgrace," and "witch hunt" dominate the text, framing prosecutors as un-American villains.  
- **Repetition and sloganeering**: Phrases like "Rigged Witch Hunt" and "weak sister" are hammered to entrench a narrative.  
- **Distortion of reality**: Exaggerations ("stealth coup") and oversimplifications (blaming Democrats exclusively) ignore evidence-based scrutiny of Russian interference.  
- **Suppression of dissent**: Thought-terminating clichés ("TOTAL HOAX") dismiss the investigation without engaging its findings.  
- **Partisan agenda**: The text parrots Trump’s tweets uncritically, omitting context (e.g., Mueller’s Republican affiliation) and amplifying conspiracy theories.  

While the text includes factual elements (e.g., Sessions’ recusal, Manafort’s trial), these are embedded in manipulative framing. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of verifiable events, but the pervasive use of propaganda techniques confirms its primary function is to influence opinion, not inform.
