### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic due to its systematic use of emotionally manipulative techniques to vilify opponents and delegitimize the FBI investigation. Key indicators include:  
- **Biased framing**: Portrays Senate Democrats as irrational ("temper tantrums") and Kavanaugh as exclusively victimized, while dismissing allegations as a "smear" with "zero evidence."  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded language ("slanderous accusations," "political hit") and fear appeals (investigation becoming a "circus") aim to provoke anger/outrage.  
- **Distortion of reality**: Straw men, causal oversimplification, and black/white fallacies misrepresent opponents' arguments and simplify complex events (e.g., attributing the investigation solely to partisan "tantrums").  
- **Suppression of dissent**: Thought-terminating clichés ("political hit") discourage critical analysis of the allegations.  
- **Irrelevant distractions**: The Nikki Haley poll serves no purpose but to divert attention.  
While factual elements exist (e.g., Trump ordering the investigation, witness cooperation), they are embedded in a narrative designed to polarize and discredit opposition. The text’s primary goal is persuasion, not balanced reporting, aligning with propaganda’s core function. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges minor factual reporting but does not mitigate the overwhelming propagandistic intent.
