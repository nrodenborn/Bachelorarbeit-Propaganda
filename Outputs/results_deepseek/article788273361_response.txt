### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Democrats, they do pick their 'victims' well, don’t they?" (Uses sarcastic labeling to insult Democrats).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrase central to the message (e.g., no rallying cry like "Make America Great").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No explicit threat or fear-based warning about alternatives; focuses on hypocrisy, not imminent danger.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Yet Democrats don’t think his accuser meets the same threshhold as Kavanaugh’s accuser?" (Questions credibility of Democrats' consistency).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates Democratic hypocrisy by framing Monahan as wholly ignored while Ford is universally supported, despite mentions of DNC reviews.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or national identity; focuses on partisan politics.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "turning a blind eye," "smeared, threatened, isolated," "hypocritical" (emotionally charged terms to vilify Democrats).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to hated groups (e.g., Nazis, extremists).  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "Many other Democrats and progressives... came out in support of Ford" (implies pressure to join popular stance).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes Democrats' actions solely to political opportunism, ignoring complexities like timing or evidence scrutiny.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Accusations are specific (e.g., text messages, bed-dragging incident); no deliberate confusion.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Monahan cites medical records and witnesses, but these support her claim, not an external authority endorsing the propaganda.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – "both parties only care if it scores political points" (reduces issue to two extremes: pure hypocrisy vs. genuine concern).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Democrats, they do pick their 'victims' well" (shuts down nuance by implying calculated bias).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The poll about Nikki Haley’s replacement distracts from the Ellison/Kavanaugh narrative.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Portrays Democrats as universally dismissing Monahan despite acknowledging DNC reviews and primary wins (misrepresents their stance).  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – "yet curiously, finding time... to go after Brett Kavanaugh" (charges Democrats with hypocrisy by contrasting their treatment of Monahan vs. Ford).  

### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is highly likely propaganda due to its systematic use of manipulative techniques to advance a partisan narrative. It employs **name-calling** (e.g., "pick their 'victims'"), **repetition** (the poll), **loaded language** (e.g., "smeared"), **bandwagon appeals**, and **whataboutism** to frame Democrats as hypocrites while downplaying Republican actions. The **black-and-white fallacy** oversimplifies the issue, and the **red herring** poll distracts from core arguments. Although it cites factual events (Monahan’s allegations), these are selectively presented to exaggerate bias (**exaggeration**) and discredit opponents (**doubt**, **straw men**). The source (Pamela Geller, a known controversial figure) and platform (Freedom Outpost, a right-leaning site) further indicate ideological framing. While Monahan’s quotes add authenticity, the article’s structure—contrasting Ellison/Kavanaugh, embedding inflammatory rhetoric, and omitting Democratic responses—reveals a clear intent to persuade, not inform. Thus, it functions primarily as propaganda to delegitimize Democrats.
