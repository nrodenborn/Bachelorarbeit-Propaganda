1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Russia as a "bad actor, hostile regime," which is an insulting label used to characterize the country and its government.
2. Repetition – Yes – The list of alleged crimes ("bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering") is repeated multiple times. The existence of a "treasure trove" of documents is also mentioned repeatedly by different speakers to reinforce its significance.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase "follow the money" is used multiple times as a brief, memorable phrase to suggest a simple path to uncovering the alleged crimes.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes that the deal gave a "hostile regime" (Russia) control over "20 percent of the U.S. Uranium," framing it as a "national security compromise" to instill fear in the audience.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built around casting doubt on the integrity of the Clinton family, the Obama administration, and the Justice Department. For example, John Solomon states, "There are a lot of things that people have been saying that these documents simply don’t agree with," directly questioning the credibility of previous statements.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggerated terms like "Bombshell," "exploding scandal," and "treasure trove" to heighten the story's importance. It also minimizes the original Trump-Russia investigation, suggesting its only purpose was "to undermine the Trump administration."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a "national security compromise" and suggesting the FBI informant will "become an American hero" for exposing it.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like "Bombshell," "exploding scandal," "ugly Clinton led deal," and "dirt" to evoke a strong emotional response from the audience.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – Hannity attempts to create a sense of growing consensus by stating, "I’m not the only one thinking that" in reference to the reporters deserving a Pulitzer, implying that this view is becoming more widespread.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the approval of the Uranium One deal, a complex process involving nine government agencies (CFIUS), by attributing it to a simple, single cause: a corrupt quid pro quo involving the Clintons ("follow the money").
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – While sounding specific, the speakers are vague about the actual proof. They refer to what the evidence "will be corroborated" or what "we will report on then the next couple of weeks," hinting at bombshells without providing concrete, verifiable details.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The entire segment relies on the credibility of the guests, who are presented as authorities: "investigative reporter Sara Carter," "John Solomon of The Hill," and "Victoria Toensing, an attorney." Their positions are used as evidence for their claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a simple conflict between corrupt officials (Clinton, Obama) and heroic truth-tellers (the reporters, the informant), ignoring any possibility of nuance or alternative explanations for the Uranium One deal's approval.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like "follow the money" and "The American people deserve the truth" are used. These are presented as self-evident truths that discourage deeper critical thought about the complexities of the situation.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the investigation into the Trump administration and Russia as a way to pivot the discussion. It distracts from that topic by claiming the investigation is now "zeroing in on key Clinton team members" instead.
17. Straw men – Yes – John Solomon refutes a simplified version of the Justice Department's position by saying they claimed "there’s no connection to uranium one," and then "disproves" this straw man by stating there are emails that mention the company.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects from the Trump-Russia investigation by pivoting to the Clintons. The framing is essentially, "You are investigating Trump for connections to Russia? What about the Clintons' connections to Russia via the Uranium One deal?"

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and overt example of propaganda. Its purpose is not to inform but to persuade the audience to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint of the Clinton family and the Obama administration. It employs a dense combination of nearly every listed propaganda technique to achieve this. The narrative is constructed using emotionally loaded language ("bombshell," "scandal," "ugly deal") and appeals to fear (a "national security compromise"). It relies heavily on appeals to the authority of the guests rather than presenting concrete evidence, using intentional vagueness ("we will report on then the next couple of weeks") to create an impression of substance. The entire premise is a form of whataboutism, deflecting from the Trump-Russia investigation to focus on the Clintons. The complex issue of the deal's approval is reduced to a simple, malicious cause (causal oversimplification), and the situation is presented as a black-and-white struggle between good and evil. The constant repetition of accusations and the use of slogans create a persuasive and emotionally charged narrative designed to bypass critical analysis, which is the primary function of propaganda.
