1. Name calling – No – The text uses questioning labels like “alleged hero” and “infamous security guard,” but these are primarily used to cast doubt rather than as direct, insulting labels.

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the idea of a “changing narrative” and the “mystery” surrounding the central figure. Examples include: “the narrative is constantly changing around,” “The ever-changing narrative now though,” and “so why change the narrative to make it even more unbelievable?”

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text fosters a sense of fear and distrust towards official institutions by suggesting a high-level cover-up in a mass casualty event. The line, “There are obviously certain things that the FBI and other investigators seem intent on covering up,” implies a sinister and powerful deception.

5. Doubt – Yes – This is the primary technique used throughout the text. The entire article is constructed to question the credibility of the official narrative and Jesus Campos. Examples include the title, “Raises New Questions About Official Narrative,” and questions like, “So who is Jesus Campos?” and “What happened during those six minutes?”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of inconsistencies, framing them as proof of a conspiracy, while minimizing the possibility of simple human error or the natural confusion of a chaotic investigation. For example, it describes the official narrative as “quickly shattering.”

7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism; in fact, it seeks to undermine trust in national and local authorities.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader’s perception. Examples include “infamous,” “alleged hero,” “burning question,” “unknown mystery,” “Strangely,” and “unbelievable.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to hated figures like Nazis.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text uses a subtle bandwagon appeal by stating the central question has “bothered many,” suggesting that the reader is not alone in their skepticism and should join the growing group of doubters.

11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not propose a simple cause for the event. Instead, it implies the cause is a complex conspiracy that is being hidden by the simple “official narrative.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article itself is not vague; it is direct in its purpose of creating doubt. It accuses the authorities of obfuscation but does not use the technique itself.

13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does the opposite; it is an appeal *against* authority, systematically attempting to discredit the police and FBI.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either the initial, simple narrative is 100% correct, or there is a malicious cover-up. It does not allow for a middle ground, such as a messy and confusing investigation where details emerge and change over time.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase, “There are obviously certain things that the FBI and other investigators seem intent on covering up,” is presented as a conclusive fact, intended to shut down further nuanced discussion and encourage acceptance of a conspiracy.

16. Red herring – No – While the evidence presented is speculative, all of it is directed at the central argument of discrediting the official narrative and Jesus Campos. No truly irrelevant material is introduced to distract.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text sets up a straw man of a perfect, unchanging “official narrative.” It then attacks the natural evolution of an active investigation (the changing timeline) as if it were a deliberate lie, refuting a claim of initial perfection that was never made by authorities.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy on another matter; it maintains a direct focus on questioning the Las Vegas investigation.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform objectively but to persuade the audience to adopt a specific viewpoint—namely, that the official account of the Las Vegas shooting is a deliberate lie and cover-up. It overwhelmingly employs propaganda techniques over journalistic principles. The piece is built on a foundation of **Doubt**, using **Loaded Language** (“infamous,” “shattering”), **Repetition** of the “changing narrative” theme, and **Appeals to Fear** (of a cover-up) to create a sense of suspicion and conspiracy. It presents a **Black & White Fallacy** by framing the situation as either the simple official story or a sinister plot, ignoring the complexities of a real-world crisis investigation. By setting up and attacking a **Straw Man** of a flawless official account and using **Thought-Terminating Clichés** like “obviously… covering up,” the text actively discourages critical thinking in favor of a pre-determined, conspiratorial conclusion.
