Based on the definitions provided and analysis of the text, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – Repeatedly uses "Kritarch" (a derogatory term implying judicial tyranny) for Judge Saris, and "illegal aliens" for the immigrants.  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeats "Kritarch," "illegal aliens," and "Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty" to reinforce negative framing.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans (e.g., no equivalents to "Make America Great").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Partial/Indirect – Implies judges are usurping power and allowing dangerous illegals to stay, but not explicit fear appeal.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Judge Saris's competence ("seems confused," "making up law," "does not understand") and motives ("deliberate campaign").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates: Indonesian IQ as "retarded"; minimizes: persecution against Chinese Christians as "limited in time."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Indirect – Implied in "immigration laws of the United States" and "build the wall," but not overt patriotism appeal.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Uses emotionally charged terms like "Obama Regime," "rogue," "illegal aliens," "credulous judges," "fool," and "retarded."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazism.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Does not emphasize popularity of the stance.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames "liberal asylum process" for allowing fraud, ignoring systemic/legal complexities.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Partial – "Emergency procedures" is vaguely referenced but not fully obfuscated.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Indirect – Cites "federal law" and "Congress" to dismiss judicial authority, but not endorsing a specific authority figure.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents deportation as the only valid option vs. judges enabling lawlessness (e.g., "Saris wants these illegals to never leave").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Uses "elections have consequences" to shut down debate on policy nuances.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introduces irrelevant IQ claims (e.g., "87 IQ is retarded") to discredit Indonesians.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents Saris's order as wanting illegals to "never leave" or "submit another asylum application" indefinitely.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy against opponents.  

---

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs multiple techniques (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, exaggeration, straw men) to delegitimize immigrants, Judge Saris, and political opponents. Key indicators include:  
- **Dehumanizing language**: "Illegal aliens," "retarded," and racialized IQ arguments.  
- **Consistent bias**: Portrays immigrants as fraudulent elites exploiting the system while downplaying their persecution.  
- **Political framing**: Uses "Obama Regime" (implying illegitimacy) and "kritarch" (to suggest judicial overreach).  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Anger and contempt permeate the text, discouraging objective analysis.  
The 5% uncertainty stems from the inclusion of factual elements (e.g., the Reuters excerpt), but these are heavily distorted to serve the agenda. The text’s primary goal is to persuade through emotive manipulation rather than balanced argumentation.
