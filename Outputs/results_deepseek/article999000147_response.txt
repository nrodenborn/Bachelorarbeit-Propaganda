Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "criminal Democrat Party" and "Fauxahontas" (insulting labels).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan..." is repeated verbatim three times.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The caravan poll *implies* fear but isn't explicitly used to support an alternative idea in the ethics complaint narrative.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "will the Senate hold these women to the standard they've set?" (questions credibility of Senate accountability).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "criminal Democrat Party" (exaggeration of alleged misconduct).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "criminal," "Fauxahontas," "gung ho," "cashing in" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeals to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames Harris/Warren for violations without addressing nuances of ethics rules.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Language is direct, not obscure.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – FACT is cited but not treated as unquestionable authority.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Poll offers only "yes/no" on military force; implies ethics violations are unambiguous.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "rightly so" and "of course" shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The caravan poll distracts from the ethics complaint topic.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy against critics.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It employs multiple techniques (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, repetition, red herring) to vilify Harris and Warren while promoting a biased narrative. The language is inflammatory ("criminal Democrat Party," "Fauxahontas"), and the irrelevant caravan poll serves as fear-based distraction. Though it references a real ethics complaint, the framing is manipulative: it omits context (e.g., standard fundraising practices), uses emotionally charged rhetoric, and urges readers to reject Warren ("Could the good people of Massachusetts... elect someone else?"). The goal is clearly to delegitimize political opponents rather than neutrally inform.
