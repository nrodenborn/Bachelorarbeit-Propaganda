1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly refers to Iran as a “rogue regime” and its behavior as “outlaw behavior.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that Iran is an “aggressive, destabilizing” force and that its behavior is destructive is repeated multiple times throughout the text, for example, in the phrases “aggressive, destabilizing force,” “aggressive, destabilizing, and unlawful behavior,” and “all aspects of Iran’s destructive conduct.”
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear by suggesting Iran could become a nuclear threat comparable to North Korea, stating, “When a rogue regime starts down the path of ballistic missiles, it tells us that we will soon have another North Korea on our hands.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the Iran nuclear deal, calling it “disastrous” and “loophole-ridden,” and casts doubt on the ability of international inspectors to do their job, quoting the IAEA Director General as saying his agency’s “tools are limited.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates Iran's influence by stating, “nearly every threat to peace and security in the Middle East is connected to Iran’s outlaw behavior.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue around threats to the United States, mentioning potential harm to “U.S. forces and bases in the region” and that an Iranian proxy has “vowed that once ISIS is defeated it will start killing Americans.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as calling the nuclear deal “disastrous,” Iran’s actions “brazenly,” and the American government’s previous considerations “stupidity.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text quotes an IRGC commander who disapproves of U.S. policy by equating the U.S. military with a hated group: "then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world."
10. Bandwagon – No – The text argues against the position of multiple European allies and former U.S. officials, rather than suggesting its own position is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple cause for a complex issue by stating that Iran is “flush with cash, thanks to the JCPOA,” implying the nuclear deal is the sole reason for Iran’s ability to finance its regional activities.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its argument and accusations; it does not use vague or obscure language to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text extensively quotes U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley and cites The Heritage Foundation to lend credibility to its arguments.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by framing the situation as a choice between confronting Iran now or allowing it to become “the next North Korea,” dismissing the existing deal and other diplomatic options as “worthless.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase “kick the can down the road” to dismiss the alternative policy of maintaining the nuclear deal without engaging in a nuanced discussion of its merits.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text describes how Ambassador Haley, at a UN session “supposed to be devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” instead used her entire speech to “denounce the Iranian regime,” thus introducing a different topic to distract from the scheduled one.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the argument of the JCPOA’s proponents. It reframes their concern about U.S. credibility for future treaties as simply wanting to “kick the can down the road,” a weaker position that is easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text uses this technique when quoting Ambassador Haley, who deflects from the specifics of the Iran deal by charging opponents with hypocrisy regarding North Korea: “If it is wrong for North Korea to do this, why doesn’t that same mentality apply to Iran?”

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint towards Iran and the JCPOA, while simultaneously validating the actions of the Trump administration. This is evidenced by the sheer number of propaganda techniques employed (16 out of the 18 listed). The article consistently uses loaded language and name-calling ("rogue regime," "disastrous deal") to create an emotional, rather than a rational, response. It builds a narrative of fear by repeatedly linking Iran to North Korea. The piece relies heavily on one-sided appeals to authority (Nikki Haley, The Heritage Foundation) while dismissing and misrepresenting opposing viewpoints (European allies, former Secretaries of State) using straw man arguments and black & white fallacies. The complete lack of any counter-argument or alternative perspective, combined with the clear persuasive intent and emotional manipulation, confirms its nature as propaganda rather than objective analysis.
