1. **Name calling – Yes**

    Explanation: No authoritative figures cited for validation.

14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes**  
    Explanation: Presents law enforcement as either covering up for Muslims or being negligent, ignoring nuanced possibilities.

### Verdict – 95% Propaganda  
**Explanation:**  
The text employs **13/18 propaganda techniques**, including inflammatory labels ("Jihadi Muslims"), fear-mongering (child murder), repetition (Kavanaugh poll), and oversimplification (blaming law enforcement for covering up to "protect Islam"). Loaded language ("horrifying," "sharia compliance") and emotional manipulation dominate the narrative. The irrelevant Kavanaugh poll acts as a red herring, while terms like "sharia compliance" serve as thought-terminating clichés. The article’s reliance on stereotypes, distortion of facts, and absence of balanced evidence confirm its propagandistic intent. Sources like Pamela Geller (noted for anti-Islam rhetoric) further undermine objectivity. While not 100% (due to absent techniques like *whataboutism*), the overwhelming use of manipulative tactics indicates a high probability of propaganda aimed at vilifying Muslims and law enforcement.
