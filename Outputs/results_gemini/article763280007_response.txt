Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the governments of Britain and continental Europe as “political elites” and their actions as “tyranny.” It also describes Theresa May’s government as “relentlessly appeasement-minded.”

Repetition – Yes – The text quotes Wilders repeating the phrase “No more!” and the author repeatedly uses phrases such as “jihad preachers” and “Muslim rape gangs” to reinforce a central theme.

Slogans – Yes – The text quotes several slogans used by Wilders in his speech, such as “enough is enough” and “We will never surrender.”

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that if the current trend is not stopped, it will lead to “the death of Britain as a free society and the beginning of an authoritarian police state there” and a “slide to totalitarianism.”

Doubt – Yes – The text consistently questions the credibility and motives of the British government, suggesting its intent in imprisoning Tommy Robinson was to “make sure that as few people as possible discovered the truth about its massive, years-long cover-up of those rape gangs.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the situation by stating, “We are almost foreigners in our own lands,” and by framing the imprisonment of one individual as heralding “the death of Britain as a free society.” It minimizes the legal reason for Robinson’s imprisonment (violating a court order) to focus on a political motive.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to national and civilizational identity with phrases like “We are almost foreigners in our own lands,” “We will defend our civilization,” and “We will protect our people.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases such as “tyranny,” “jihad terror,” “Sharia oppression,” “Muslim rape gangs,” and “sacrifice of thousands of British girls” to evoke strong emotional responses.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular with a group hated by the audience, such as Nazis.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text emphasizes the size of the rally (“massive rally,” “20,000 people”) and quotes Wilders saying, “for every Tommy whom you imprison, thousands will rise up,” suggesting a large and growing movement.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex legal and social situation around Tommy Robinson’s imprisonment, attributing it to a single cause: the government’s desire to “cover-up of those rape gangs, and refusal to prosecute the perpetrators.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and makes clear, specific accusations rather than using deliberately unclear or obscure expressions.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents Geert Wilders, a Dutch politician, as an authority whose speech reveals “a strong dose of the reality that they [the British authorities] are determined to ignore and deny.” The author also implicitly presents themself as an authority by mentioning their own ban from the UK.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by stating that British public figures “should be calling for him to be freed today, or else they will be exposing themselves as supporting the degeneration of Britain into a police state.”

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “enough is enough,” quoted in the text, is a cliché used to shut down discussion and signal that no further debate or nuance is required.

Red herring – Yes – While the central topic is Tommy Robinson’s imprisonment, the text introduces a long list of other individuals who were either banned from or admitted to the UK. This distracts from the specific legal facts of Robinson’s case to make a broader, more generalized argument about government hypocrisy.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that the government did not make. It claims the government imprisoned Robinson for “having opinions that it considers unacceptable,” misrepresenting the legal charge of contempt of court in order to attack the government for suppressing free speech.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text repeatedly deflects from the actions of the figures it supports by pointing to the UK government’s alleged hypocrisy, asking why critics of Islam are banned while “Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation.”

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. It is not an objective report but a persuasive article designed to promote a specific political viewpoint by appealing to emotion rather than reason. The text employs an overwhelming majority (16 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques. Its entire structure is built on a foundation of fear-mongering (the "death of Britain," "totalitarianism"), loaded language ("jihad terror," "Muslim rape gangs"), and creating a stark "us vs. them" narrative (the people vs. the "political elites"). It uses whataboutism and red herrings to deflect from the legal case at hand, simplifies complex issues into a good vs. evil struggle, and uses bandwagon appeals and slogans to create a sense of an unstoppable popular movement. The sheer density and combination of these techniques confirm that the author's primary goal is not to inform, but to persuade and radicalize the reader to their cause.
