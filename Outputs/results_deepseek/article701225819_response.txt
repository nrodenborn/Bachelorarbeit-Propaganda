### Verdict – 80% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements, primarily through **name-calling**, **loaded language**, and **appeal to fear** to vilify Sofian Zakkout and demand his removal from public roles. It selectively presents documented evidence (e.g., social media posts) to frame Zakkout as an irredeemable bigot, using techniques like **reduction ad Hitlerum** (guilt-by-association with David Duke) and **black-and-white fallacy** (omitting any mitigating context). The tone is emotionally charged, aiming to provoke outrage rather than encourage balanced discourse. However, it avoids overt distortion (e.g., dates/quotes are cited accurately), and some techniques (e.g., slogans, obfuscation) are absent. Ultimately, its one-sided narrative, urgent call to action ("It is time for Zakkout to be exposed"), and reliance on persuasive tactics over objective analysis align it with propaganda—though rooted in verifiable events. The 20% uncertainty reflects the use of factual evidence, even if deployed manipulatively.
