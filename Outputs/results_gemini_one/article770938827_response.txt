Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack subjects, such as in the title "The Hammond Pardons Bring Justice to Obama's Victims" and the concluding phrase "another stain from our nation's history in the dark years of Obama."

Repetition – Yes – The core message of the Obama administration's injustice versus the Trump administration's justice is repeated throughout the text. Examples include the title, "The previous administration, however, filed an overzealous appeal," "This was unjust," and "While Obama pardoned drug dealers and locked up ranchers, Trump pardons ranchers and locks up drug dealers."

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases intended for mass repetition.

Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses on past and present grievances rather than attempting to instill fear of a future alternative.

Doubt – Yes – The text actively questions the credibility of multiple parties. Example: "The media very deliberately misreported the Bundy standoff" and "Aiken was unqualified for her role, except in the ways that mattered to the Clintons and their Dem allies."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the crime by stating the fire "leaked onto a small portion of neighboring public grazing land" and exaggerates the outcome by calling the pardons an act that "cleanse another stain from our nation's history."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a national one. Example: "These pardons cleanse another stain from our nation's history in the dark years of Obama."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader. Examples include "Victims," "murder," "overzealous appeal," "unjust," and "stain."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to groups like the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that the idea is popular and should be adopted for that reason.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue. Example: It attributes the media's alleged lack of coverage to simple reasons: "That was in part because it would have been damaging to Obama. And because they didn't care."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses a judge's opinion as evidence to support its point. Example: "the judge noted that they are respected in the community and that imposing the mandatory minimum, 5-year prison sentence would “shock the conscience” and be “grossly disproportionate to the severity” of their conduct."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a situation with only two opposing options. Example: "While Obama pardoned drug dealers and locked up ranchers, Trump pardons ranchers and locks up drug dealers."

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases that are meant to discourage critical thought.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces irrelevant material to distract from the core legal arguments. Example: "Aiken was a Dem fundraiser, her husband was the chair of the Oregon Dem party, appointed by Bill Clinton." This attacks the judge's character and political affiliation rather than addressing the legal basis for her ruling.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an opponent's argument that was not actually presented.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges the Obama administration with hypocrisy. Example: "The same administration that was against mandatory minimums for its drug dealers and gang members went to court to defend mandatory minimums under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act."

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. It employs a vast number of propaganda techniques (at least 12 of the 18 listed) to construct a highly biased and emotionally charged narrative. Rather than presenting a neutral account of the Hammond pardons, the text's primary goal is to persuade the reader to view the Obama administration as malicious and unjust and the Trump administration as a righteous corrective force. This is achieved through name-calling ("Obama's Victims"), loaded language ("murder," "stain"), creating a false black & white dichotomy between the two administrations, and casting doubt on the credibility of the media and the judiciary. The piece systematically omits context and simplifies complex legal and political issues into a simple story of good versus evil, which is a hallmark of propaganda.
