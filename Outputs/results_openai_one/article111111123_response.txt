**Final verdict:**

**Verdict – 40% –**  
The text contains some elements of propaganda, notably the use of doubt (questioning the credibility of the investigation and party response), loaded language (emotionally charged descriptions of Monahan’s treatment), appeal to authority (relying on the lawyer’s findings), and whataboutism (highlighting perceived hypocrisy in the Democratic Party’s handling of similar allegations). However, the majority of the text is factual reporting, quoting statements from involved parties and providing context. The presence of propaganda techniques is moderate but not overwhelming, and the primary intent appears to be to inform rather than to manipulate. Thus, there is a moderate likelihood (40%) that the text is propaganda, primarily due to the inclusion of doubt, loaded language, and whataboutism, but it does not rise to the level of overt or systematic propaganda.
