### Verdict – 20% – Explanation:  
The text is primarily **factual reporting** from POLITICO, detailing events (convictions, sentencing, protests) and quoting stakeholders (White House, Bundy, family). However, it includes propagandistic elements **selectively embedded in White House statements**: minimization (#6), loaded language (#8), bandwagon (#10), and appeal to authority (#13). These techniques frame the Hammonds sympathetically and legitimize the pardon, aligning with Trump’s narrative. Yet, the article balances this with neutral context: the arson conviction, federal appeals, and the armed standoff. No overt fear-mongering, distortions, or partisan attacks appear in the reporting itself. The 20% likelihood reflects quoted propaganda (from official sources) within an otherwise objective journalistic structure.
