Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "radical anti-Israel hate group", "anti-Semite", "#BDStears", "entitled nonsense", "hate sites", "whines". These are insulting labels applied to JVP, individuals, their reactions, and publications.
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – "#BDStears" is repeated multiple times (e.g., "the #BDStears come out", "latest outbreak of #BDStears", "flooding the media with #BDStears", "outbreak of them", "#BDStears crowd").
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "#BDStears" functions as a brief, memorable, and mocking slogan repeated throughout the text.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Links JVP to defending antisemitism and sponsoring talks by someone accusing Jews of drinking blood. Suggests AJHS partnering with them means they "have lost a key aspect of their Jewishness". Implies BDS attacks "the human rights of the Jewish people". The KKK comparison also invokes fear.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – Questions AJHS's current purpose: "founded to study and preserve Jewish history... These days it’s instead partnering with...". Questions the legitimacy of Fishback's complaint: "Let's unpack this knapsack of entitled nonsense".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration: "flooding the media", "outbreak of them", "radical anti-Israel hate group", "advocate a boycott of the Jews of Israel", "burn crosses on their lawn". Minimization: Downplays Fishback's perspective as "whines" and "entitled nonsense".
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Strong appeals to Jewish identity and loyalty: "lost a key aspect of their Jewishness", "people of dissent and argument", "the Jewish community won't let them", "attack the human rights of the Jewish people". Positions the author as defending true Jewishness.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Pervasive emotionally charged words: "hate group", "anti-Semite", "whines", "entitled nonsense", "propaganda campaign", "attack", "terrorist group", "burn crosses", "exploit", "hate sites". Uses strong negative connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes** – Compares Fishback to universally condemned groups: "Him, the PLO and the KKK." This aims to associate Fishback with these groups to discredit him.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – The text does not primarily argue that the reader should agree because the idea is popular. It focuses on attacking the opposition and defending a position based on identity and perceived threats.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Blames the AJHS partnership with JVP as the simple cause for them losing their Jewishness: "If our Jewish institutions... cannot accommodate dissent... then they have... lost a key aspect of their Jewishness." Ignores other complex factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The author's points and accusations are generally stated directly and clearly, even if inflammatory or exaggerated. There's no significant attempt to be deliberately vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – The text does not cite any external authorities to support its claims. It relies on the author's own assertions and interpretations.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents the situation as only two options: Either accept Fishback/JVP/BDS views on dissent/Zionism, or be excluded from Jewishness/lose key aspects of Jewishness ("If our Jewish institutions... cannot accommodate dissent... then they have... lost a key aspect of their Jewishness"). Also implied in "the Jewish community won't let them burn crosses on their lawn" – equating opposition with exclusion.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Phrases like "Let's unpack this knapsack of entitled nonsense" and "what's good for the goose is good for the gander" are used to dismiss Fishback's entire argument as unworthy of serious consideration and shut down debate.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – Introduces the Hamas tweet by Jonathan Kuttab ("EU no longer considers #Hamas a terrorist group. Time for US to do same.") which is largely irrelevant to the core argument about boycotting plays and AJHS events, but serves to associate the event/speakers with terrorism.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Misrepresents Fishback's argument about dissent. Fishback laments being excluded for his views; the author reframes this as Fishback demanding Jews welcome *only* dissent that "hate[s] the existence of Jewish nationhood" and not dissent about "Jewish nationhood itself," implying Fishback wants to suppress pro-Israel views, which isn't stated in the quoted text.
18. **Whataboutism – Yes** – Counters Fishback's complaint about being boycotted by pointing out his past support for boycotting Israeli plays: "Previously Dan Fishback had authored an article arguing for boycotting some Israeli plays. Now he's whining that boycotting his play is a violation of Jewishness...". This charges Fishback with hypocrisy to deflect from the current complaint.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a wide array of propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Reduction ad Hitlerum, Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-Terminating Clichés, Red Herring, Straw Men, Whataboutism) to aggressively attack Dan Fishback, JVP, BDS, and the AJHS partnership. Its primary purpose is not balanced analysis but to discredit the opposition, evoke strong negative emotions (fear, anger, disgust), reinforce in-group identity (Jewishness defined against anti-Zionism), and persuade the reader to reject the criticized individuals and groups. The language is consistently inflammatory and one-sided, dismissing opposing views as "nonsense" and "whines," while framing the author's stance as the defense of Jewish rights and identity. The lack of substantive engagement with the opposing arguments beyond mockery and demonization further signals propaganda.
