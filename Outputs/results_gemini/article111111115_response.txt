1. Name calling – No – The text uses descriptive titles like "Sen. Al Franken," "the Minnesota Democrat," and "the former comedian," but does not use any insulting labels to attack him.
2. Repetition – No – The text lists several different accusations from different people. While the theme is consistent, it is not repeating the same message or phrase.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text reports on past events and does not attempt to instill fear in the reader about alternative ideas or outcomes.
5. Doubt – No – The text reports on the accusers' claims and Franken's denials or memory lapses, which inherently involves doubt. However, the article itself does not cast doubt; it reports the facts of the situation as presented by the involved parties.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text presents the accusations and Franken's responses without any apparent attempt by the author to exaggerate or minimize the claims.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions the USO tour as a factual detail of where an event occurred, not as an appeal to patriotism.
8. Loaded Language – No – The text uses neutral, journalistic language to report the events (e.g., "says," "told," "writes"). While the accusations themselves contain emotionally charged descriptions ("aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth"), these are attributed to the accusers, not language created by the author to sway the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text makes no comparisons to hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text reports that "About 30 Senate Democrats... have urged the Minnesota Democrat to step down." This is a factual report on a political development, not an appeal to the reader to follow the crowd.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not offer a simple cause for a complex event. Instead, it lists multiple, distinct accusations that contributed to the calls for resignation.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is structured as a clear, itemized list and provides specific details where available. It is not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text cites its sources (e.g., HuffPost, Politico, Jezebel), which is standard journalistic practice of attribution, not the propaganda technique of using an authority's opinion as sole evidence for a claim.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text presents a complex situation with multiple accusations and a range of responses from Franken (denial, apology, not remembering). It does not reduce the situation to only two simple options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases designed to discourage critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – All information presented is directly relevant to the topic of the sexual misconduct accusations against Al Franken.
17. Straw men – No – The text presents the accusations and then Franken's direct responses to them. It does not misrepresent or refute an argument that was not made.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text remains focused on the accusations against Al Franken and does not attempt to deflect by accusing others of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 5% – This text is a piece of journalistic reporting, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader by compiling and summarizing a series of public accusations from various sources and the corresponding responses from the subject, Senator Al Franken. The language is neutral, factual, and attributed. It systematically avoids all the listed propaganda techniques, instead opting for a clear, list-based structure to present information. While the subject matter is highly controversial and emotional, the text itself does not use loaded language, appeals to emotion, or other manipulative tactics to persuade the audience. It reports on the political "bandwagon" of senators calling for his resignation but does not use the technique on the reader. The low percentage reflects that any editorial choice of what to include or exclude can have a persuasive effect, but this text strongly adheres to the standards of informative news reporting rather than propaganda.
