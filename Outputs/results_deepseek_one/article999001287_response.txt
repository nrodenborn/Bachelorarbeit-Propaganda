Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No direct insulting labels applied to the subject (FL Democrats) beyond the accusation itself ("caught altering"). Terms like "ineptitude" or "deception" are used as possibilities in the investigation, not as direct labels.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The phrase "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times consecutively in the poll section. "Called and called" in the opening line also uses repetition.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans within the core text reporting the events. "BUILD THE WALL!" is an example, nothing equivalent appears here.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The opening line ("Florida should be called and called now unless the GOP wants to Florida and Georgia stolen the way they are stealing House seats") instills fear that elections are being stolen, urging immediate action to prevent loss. The word "stolen" is used repeatedly.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The text repeatedly casts doubt on the Florida Democrats' actions and motives: "It seems that Democrats may have...", "It also looks like whoever sent out...", "It looks like Democrats may have hurt their own interests...", "They may have believed... but they still should not have...", "It is yet to be determined whether... ineptitude or deception".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The headline ("FL Democrats Caught Altering Election Documents") and the framing ("stealing House seats") present the alleged alteration of dates on cure affidavits as a major act of electoral fraud ("Altering Election Documents", "stealing"). The scale and proven intent (beyond alleged alteration of dates on forms provided to voters) is not established, potentially exaggerating the severity. Minimization is not evident.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeals to patriotism, national identity, or "us vs. them" based on national loyalty. The focus is on partisan (GOP vs. Dems) and electoral integrity, not national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Highly charged, negative words are used: "stolen", "stealing", "caught Altering", "controversy", "troubling history", "transgressions", "deliberately altered", "mishandling", "ineptitude", "deception". These evoke strong negative emotions against the Democrats mentioned.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally condemned groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – The repeated poll ("Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?") and statements like "Completing this poll grants you access..." and "Do you agree with the call for a federal investigation? Yes/No" are attempts to create a sense of joining a group or movement (bandwagon) by participating.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text reports on a specific alleged action (altering dates on forms) and its potential consequences (voters misled, votes invalidated), but does not attribute a complex outcome (like the entire election result) solely to this single cause in a simplistic way.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text reports specific allegations (altered dates on cure affidavits), cites sources (Politico, DOS letter), names involved counties (Broward, Palm Beach), and quotes specific evidence (voicemail). It is relatively clear about the claims being made.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Authorities are cited to support the claims: "Politico reported...", "According to Politico...", "Matt Dixon... tweeted...", "Bradley McVay, DOS interim general counsel, wrote...", "According to DOS officials...", "State officials turned over...".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The poll "Do you agree with the call for a federal investigation? Yes No" presents only two absolute options, ignoring potential nuanced positions (e.g., "wait for more evidence," "investigate at state level first").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" or "that's just common sense" are used to shut down discussion. The text invites engagement (polls) and presents arguments/details.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The entire section about Jim Acosta's press pass ("Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" poll repeated 3 times) is completely irrelevant to the main story about alleged election document alterations in Florida. It distracts the reader with an unrelated controversy.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text argues against the specific actions of the Florida Democratic Party (altering forms, potentially misleading voters). It does not misrepresent or refute an argument not actually made by an opponent in this context.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge opponents (Democrats) with hypocrisy by pointing to similar actions by the accuser's side (Republicans). It focuses solely on the alleged actions of the Democrats in this instance.

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits several clear propaganda techniques: **Repetition** (Acosta poll, "called and called"), **Appeal to fear** (elections being "stolen"), **Doubt** (cast on Democrat actions/intent), **Exaggeration** (framing date alterations as "Altering Election Documents" and "stealing" seats), **Loaded Language** ("stolen", "caught altering", "deception"), **Bandwagon** (Acosta poll, investigation poll), **Appeal to authority** (citing sources/officials), **Black & white fallacy** (investigation poll), and a significant **Red herring** (Jim Acosta poll). The headline is sensationalized, the language is heavily biased, and the inclusion of the completely unrelated Acosta poll is a clear distraction tactic. While the core of the text reports on a factual event (referral to federal prosecutors based on altered forms) using cited sources, the overwhelming use of manipulative techniques, framing, and irrelevant content strongly indicates an intent to promote a specific, negative view of Democrats regarding election integrity, rather than provide neutral reporting. The percentage reflects that factual elements exist within a heavily propagandistic framing and presentation.
