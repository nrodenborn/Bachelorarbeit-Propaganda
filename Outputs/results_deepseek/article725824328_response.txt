### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Selective Omission & Framing**: It emphasizes a "suppressed" photo and tangential Obama-Farrakhan connections while ignoring context (e.g., Farrakhan’s influence in Black political spaces pre-2008).  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded terms ("crook," "shaking down," "black rage") and fear appeals (Malcolm X’s fate) stoke suspicion.  
3. **Misleading Causality**: Blames Obama/BLM for a homicide surge without evidence, ignoring broader factors (e.g., socioeconomic issues, drug epidemics).  
4. **Doubt Casting**: Undermines media ("didn’t make the press") and implies Obama hid radical ties.  
5. **Guilt by Association**: Links Obama to Farrakhan (controversial but legally protected figure) and Rezko (a convicted felon) to imply hidden extremism.  
6. **Partisan Narrative**: Echoes debunked conservative conspiracy theories about Obama’s "ties to Islam" and "radicalism."  

While based on factual elements (e.g., the photo, Rezko’s crimes), the text weaponizes them via exaggeration, fearmongering, and cherry-picking to advance a biased narrative. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the photo’s existence and Rezko’s conviction, but the framing overwhelmingly aligns with propagandistic objectives: delegitimizing Obama and inflaming partisan sentiment.
