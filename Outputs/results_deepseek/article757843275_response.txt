Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. Name calling – No – No insulting labels are used against the vaccine, Ebola, or involved parties.
2. Repetition – Yes – "experimental vaccine" is repeated multiple times (e.g., "An experimental Ebola vaccine," "an experimental vaccine," "the experimental vaccine").
3. Slogans – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Descriptions of Ebola's symptoms ("bleeding through the nose, mouth, and eyes"), fatality rate ("kill up to 90% of victims"), and urban spread risk instill fear to support the vaccination campaign.
5. Doubt – Yes – Questions the vaccine's efficacy: "is warranted?" and "let’s hope it works better than this year’s flu vaccine" cast doubt on its reliability.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The description of Ebola's effects and risks aligns with known facts; no clear exaggeration or minimization is evident.
7. Flag-Waving – No – No appeal to patriotism or group identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – Words like "terrifying," "feared," "severe," "alarm," and "urgently" evoke strong emotional responses.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – No association with hated groups is made.
10. Bandwagon – No – Popularity of the vaccine or idea is not cited as a reason for support.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – No complex issue is reduced to a single cause.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – ZMapp's effectiveness is vaguely described as showing "promise" without concrete data, despite noting two deaths out of seven patients.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Relies on statements from the Minister of Health and WHO to validate the situation and response.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – No false dichotomy is presented; alternatives are acknowledged (e.g., ZMapp as a therapeutic).
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – No phrases used to shut down critical discussion.
16. Red herring – No – The flu vaccine comparison is tangential but not a deliberate distraction from the main topic.
17. Straw men – No – No misrepresented arguments are refuted.
18. Whataboutism – No – No accusations of hypocrisy are made.

**Verdict – 25% –** The text primarily reports factual information about the Ebola outbreak and vaccine rollout, citing official sources. However, it employs *Repetition* (emphasizing "experimental"), *Appeal to fear* (graphic Ebola descriptions), *Doubt* (questioning the vaccine's necessity/efficacy), *Loaded Language* ("terrifying"), and *Obfuscation* (vague claims about ZMapp). These techniques introduce a subtle bias framing the vaccine as untested and potentially ineffective while amplifying the threat, which aligns with propaganda. The overall context remains informational, but these elements slightly push a skeptical narrative, warranting a low likelihood of propaganda.
