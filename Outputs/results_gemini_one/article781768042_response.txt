Name calling – Yes – The text attacks a group it labels "professed Christians in America" with insulting labels such as: "Ungrateful reprobates, pretenders, counterfeits and hypocrites are what they are" and "They are weak and pathetic".

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times consecutively. The core message about God judging America for the same reasons as Sodom and Gomorrah is also repeated throughout the text.

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan. It relies on longer arguments and scriptural quotations.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear of divine punishment by constantly comparing modern America to the destroyed cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, warning of a "destruction (Deuteronomy 30:19) that will not be reversed".

Doubt – Yes – The text consistently questions the credibility and sincerity of "professors of Christianity today," for example: "How often I see and hear the professors of Christianity today walking contrary to the word and spirit of the Living Christ".

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the failings of the "American Church" by claiming they are solely responsible for the state of the nation ("They are weak and pathetic and they have no excuses as to why America is where we is today!"). It also minimizes complex theological debates, such as the sins of Sodom, to primarily one issue for effect.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a national and religious identity by framing the entire argument around God's judgment of "America" and the failure of the "American Church" to protect "our government, our country and our families".

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to provoke a reaction, such as "Ungrateful reprobates, pretenders, counterfeits and hypocrites," "tyranny," and "murder of 58 million innocent babies."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses the same technique by comparing its opponents to a group hated by the target audience: "Then again, these were the same types of people in Jerusalem crying out 'Crucify him! Crucify him! We have no king but Caesar'".

Bandwagon – No – The text argues against what it portrays as the popular or mainstream position within American Christianity, positioning itself as a righteous minority.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex situation: "Why did God judge Sodom and Gomorrah? It's the same reason that he is judging America today (Amos 4:12), He cannot find the righteous in order to spare her".

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; its arguments and accusations are direct and clearly stated.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on the Bible as an unquestionable authority, citing numerous verses. It also cites Charles Haddon Spurgeon and "gotquestions.org" as authorities to bolster its argument.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: follow its interpretation of God's law or be an enemy of God. For example: "...they reject the counsel of God against them by hating the good and loving the evil, and that to their own damnation."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses scriptural phrases to shut down discussion and discourage critical thought, such as presenting "Evil men understand not judgment" as an unchallengeable fact to dismiss opponents.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces an irrelevant poll about Brett Kavanaugh that distracts from the theological argument and serves to gather user information: "take our poll - story continues below / Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?"

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified version of an opposing argument, stating, "Those who attempt to explain away the biblical condemnations of homosexuality claim that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was inhospitality," in order to easily dismiss it.

Whataboutism – Yes – The entire article is an exercise in charging an opponent (the "American Church") with hypocrisy, for example: "Professed Christians in America today talk much of love through inaction, and yet know nothing of it (1 John 3:18). They read what to do, but do it not!"

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or engage in a nuanced theological discussion, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, rigid viewpoint by employing a dense concentration of propaganda techniques. The article systematically uses emotional manipulation (Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language), attacks on a target group (Name Calling, Whataboutism, Straw Men), and logical fallacies (Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy) to build its case. It shores up its argument with a constant Appeal to Authority (the Bible) while using these authoritative quotes as Thought-terminating clichés to prevent dissent. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant Red Herring (the Kavanaugh poll) further underscores that the article's purpose extends beyond argument into audience manipulation and data capture. The sheer volume and variety of techniques used, touching on nearly every category provided, confirm its nature as propaganda.
