Name calling – Yes – The text attacks public schools by labeling their curriculum and policies with insulting terms such as “Far-Left Bias,” “Left-wing social engineering,” and “craziness.”
Repetition – No – While the general theme is reinforced, the text does not repeat the same specific message or phrase over and over in the manner of the example.
Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief, memorable phrase as a rallying cry.
Appeal to fear – Yes – The text repeatedly highlights dangers in public schools, such as “school violence,” “deadly school massacres,” and “unsafe environments,” to scare parents into choosing homeschooling.
Doubt – No – The text does not primarily seek to question the credibility of a specific person or source, but rather directly attacks the public school system itself.
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text presents the author's personal homeschooling experience as a perfect success story ("Our family couldn't be happier," all children are successful) which exaggerates the likely outcomes for all families. The term "craziness" also exaggerates the nature of school policies.
Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by citing schools “refusing to allow students to wear shirts that praise POTUS Trump or feature the American flag” as a negative aspect of public education.
Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “Far-Left Bias,” “Left-wing social engineering,” and “deadly school massacres” to evoke negative emotions about public schools.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or similarly hated groups.
Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests a growing movement by stating that a homeschooling coalition has been “swamped with inquiries” and that their call and email numbers have “doubled,” encouraging readers to join this trend.
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The headline, “Homeschooling Spikes Due to School Violence, Far-Left Bias,” presents two simple causes for a complex social trend, ignoring other potential factors like academic quality, special needs, or family lifestyle choices.
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its message and what it wants the reader to believe.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites a “33-year-long study conducted by the National Home Education Research Institute” and quotes figures like Tim Lambert, “coalition president,” to lend credibility to its claims.
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the choice as one between the dangerous, politically biased public school system and the safe, value-driven world of homeschooling, ignoring other options like private schools or charter schools, or the possibility of a positive public school experience.
Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The statement, “There is no better way to keep the Catholic family together and committed to the Catholic restoration than the Catholic home school,” is presented as an absolute truth to discourage further debate or consideration of alternatives for its target audience.
Red herring – Yes – The detailed personal anecdote about the author's own children's specific successes (studying in Austria, attending Franciscan University) is an irrelevant distraction from the broader argument about national trends and serves as an emotional appeal rather than logical evidence.
Straw men – No – The text attacks the public school system directly rather than misrepresenting and refuting a specific counter-argument.
Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It begins by adopting the appearance of objective reporting, citing a "MAJOR NEW STUDY" and a news article to establish credibility (Appeal to Authority). However, it quickly reveals its persuasive intent by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques. The piece heavily relies on emotional manipulation, using Appeal to Fear by focusing on "deadly school massacres" and Loaded Language like "craziness" and "social engineering." It targets a specific political and religious demographic through Name Calling ("Far-Left Bias") and Flag-Waving (mentioning the American flag and POTUS Trump). The argument is built on logical fallacies, including Causal Oversimplification in its headline and a Black & White Fallacy that pits evil public schools against virtuous homeschooling. The use of the Bandwagon technique ("numbers have doubled") creates a sense of an urgent, popular movement. Finally, it shifts to a personal, emotional plea that uses a Red Herring (the author's family's specific success) and a Thought-terminating cliché to seal its argument. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and bypass critical thought to promote a specific agenda, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
