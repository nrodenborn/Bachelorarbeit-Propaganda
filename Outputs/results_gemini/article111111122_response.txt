1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Trump as a “reality-TV star” to frame his presidency as illegitimate and labels his administration as “a gang that can’t shoot straight,” which is a direct insult to their competence.

2. Repetition – Yes – The central message that Trump has mismanaged or “botched” the nomination is repeated throughout the text in various forms, such as “he has managed to make a complete hash of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination,” “how badly Trump does his job,” and “the Trump and his White House staff failed to do their jobs.”

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in a repetitive, slogan-like manner.

4. Appeal to fear – No – The text analyzes negative political consequences for the president but does not attempt to instill fear in the audience about alternatives to the author's viewpoint.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively questions Trump’s competence and agency, for example: “We don’t know to what extent Kavanaugh was Trump’s choice and to what extent he was manipulated into choosing him. We have plenty of evidence that Trump is easily manipulated by those around him.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The title, “Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face,” is an exaggeration. The phrase “make a complete hash” also exaggerates the level of mismanagement.

7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make any appeals to patriotism or national identity to support its arguments.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language, such as “complete hash,” “hard-liner,” “riled up,” “botched nomination,” and “lash out at his enemies in ugly ways” to create a negative impression.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to hated groups like Nazis to discredit them.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex political situation surrounding the nomination primarily to a single cause: Trump’s personal incompetence and poor judgment (“It’s a good example of how badly Trump does his job”).

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s arguments and criticisms are stated clearly and directly, without the use of intentionally confusing or obscure language.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author supports their claims by citing respected or knowledgeable figures, stating, “as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly warned” and “As the political scientist Richard Neustadt said…”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the choice of nominee as a binary between the risky Kavanaugh and a “safer, but still very conservative, other option,” ignoring the possibility of a wider spectrum of candidates and strategic considerations.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase “a gang that can’t shoot straight,” a cliché that dismisses the White House’s competence in a simple, conclusive way that discourages further thought on the matter.

16. Red herring – Yes – The author introduces the topic of the number of women in Trump's administration (“would wind up with fewer women in his administration than any of his recent predecessors”), which is related to Trump's character but is a distraction from the central argument about the strategic handling of the Kavanaugh nomination.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author brings up and refutes a speculative argument that was not presented by a direct opponent: “Some have speculated that Kavanaugh would be especially likely to rule in Trump's favor... So, no, I don't think there's any good reason to think Kavanaugh would be especially helpful to Trump compared to others he could have selected.”

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism of its subject by accusing others of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 75% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It is an opinion piece that systematically employs a large number of propaganda techniques (11 out of 18) to persuade the reader of a specific political viewpoint: that President Trump is incompetent and his administration mishandled the Kavanaugh nomination. The piece relies heavily on name-calling, loaded language, exaggeration, and casting doubt to build a negative narrative. It simplifies a complex political event into a story of personal failure (causal oversimplification) and uses rhetorical tricks like the black & white fallacy and straw men to frame the argument in its favor. While it stops short of using more extreme techniques like appeals to fear or reduction ad Hitlerum, its primary purpose is not to inform objectively but to manipulate the reader's perception of a political figure, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
