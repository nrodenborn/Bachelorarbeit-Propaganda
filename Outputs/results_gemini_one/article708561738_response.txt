Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack the subjects, for example, referring to incumbent politicians as “corrupt career politicians.”

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats its title, "How Do You Like Paying For Sexual Harassment Settlements from Your Congress, America?", as the first line of the article to reinforce the main point of outrage.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses the brief and memorable phrase, “It is time to drain the swamp,” to encapsulate its political goal.

Appeal to fear – No – The text primarily appeals to anger and outrage rather than instilling fear of an alternative.

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the sincerity and intentions of Congress by stating, “But they don’t want it to stop.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to describe the situation, for example, by calling it an “epidemic of sexual harassment.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national identity by directly addressing the reader as "America" and stating, "The American people have a right to know."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged language to influence the reader, such as “corrupt career politicians” and “sex trade on Capitol Hill.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text appeals to the idea of joining a growing movement with the phrase, "So I am asking you to support my campaign and other “grassroots deplorables” that are running for office all over the nation."

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text assumes a simple solution for a complex problem by stating, “If such a law was instituted, I guarantee you that sexual harassment on Capitol Hill would come to a screeching halt.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the support of authorities as evidence by citing, “Reid Wilson, a correspondent for the Hill” and quoting a “CNN” article.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options by stating, “It isn’t going to stop until we boot out the corrupt career politicians that are engaging in this type of behavior.”

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase, “It is time to drain the swamp,” which is a cliché that discourages critical thought about the complexities of political reform.

Red herring – No – The text stays focused on its central argument and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the audience.

Straw men – No – The text makes a direct argument and does not refute a weaker, unstated argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge an opponent with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It is built around a factual data point (the settlement numbers) but uses it to launch a highly emotional and manipulative argument. The article employs a significant number of propaganda techniques, including Loaded Language (“corrupt career politicians”), Slogans (“drain the swamp”), Flag-Waving (“The American people have a right to know”), Causal Oversimplification (a simple law will cause a "screeching halt"), and a Black & White Fallacy (the only solution is to elect the author's slate of candidates). The primary goal is not to dispassionately inform, but to generate outrage and channel it towards a specific political action: supporting the author's campaign. The combination of numerous persuasive techniques with a clear, partisan call to action is a hallmark of propaganda.
