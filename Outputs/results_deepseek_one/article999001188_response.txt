Here's the analysis of the text against the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Illegal Alien ‘Caravan’", "Crooked Hillary", "Fake News", "border-crashers", "Happy Warriors", "Leftism’s backside".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on Trump's actions and victories ("He survived... He knocked out... He beat... And Trump is still keeping promises... He'll be back.").
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "#PromisesKept", "Stay Rowdy!", "The Trumpinator", "Become a Clash Insider!".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The description of the "Illegal Alien ‘Caravan’" and the need for razor wire to stop "border-crashers" and "secure our Southern border" instills fear about immigration/border security.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "when CNN and the rest had their little fever dreams about cross-border gun battles" casts doubt on CNN's reporting. "Fake News is showing old footage" casts doubt on media reports.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "no climbers anymore under our Administration!" (exaggerates effectiveness). "their ratings are now circling the toilet" (exaggerates CNN's failure). "Mueller and the Dossier aren’t just coming up empty, they’re exposing the misdeeds..." (exaggerates Mueller outcome/minimizes its seriousness).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "secure our Southern border", "We the People" (implied), framing actions as necessary for national security/protection.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Illegal Alien ‘Caravan’", "taunting", "bravado", "border-crashers", "pushed their way", "Crooked Hillary", "knocked out", "circling the toilet", "misdeeds", "Happy Warriors", "kick in to our ‘war chest’", "maximize the size of the footprint we leave on Leftism’s backside", "Stay Rowdy!".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No direct comparison to Hitler/Nazis found.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "Become a Clash Insider!", "Sign up... and you can still get all the ClashDaily goodness", "Do you love what we’re doing... Do you want to kick in...", "we Happy Warriors" – all encourage joining the perceived popular/moral side.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributing the lack of climbers solely to Trump's razor wire ("no climbers anymore under our Administration!") oversimplifies complex migration patterns and causes.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The language is direct and inflammatory, not vague or obscure. (The military activity mention is vague but likely more dismissive than intentionally confusing).
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – "Here’s what the President said with the photo:" – Uses Trump's statement as evidence of the fence's effectiveness.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents Trump's actions (like razor wire) as the only alternative if Congress doesn't fund a wall ("If Congress insists on dragging its feet... Trump will find other ways... Like Razorwire."). Also implies Trump = good/effective vs. opponents/media = wrong/failing.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "They couldn’t have been more wrong", "#PromisesKept", "Stay Rowdy!", "Happy Warriors" – phrases used to shut down critical examination of claims.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Discussing CNN's ratings ("circling the toilet") and Facebook "censorship" distracts from the main topic of border security/Trump's actions.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – "“Take it seriously, but with a large grain of salt.” Which is just Allen’s more nuanced way of saying: “Don’t believe it.”" misrepresents the nuanced position as an extreme one. Also, the "Fake News is showing old footage" sets up a media misrepresentation to refute.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – While attacking opponents/media, it doesn't specifically charge them with hypocrisy as a deflection.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs numerous techniques (at least 13 of the 18 listed) consistently throughout. Its core purpose is not to objectively inform but to aggressively promote a specific political viewpoint (pro-Trump, anti-immigration, anti-media, anti-Democrat), using emotionally charged language (Loaded Language), attacks on opponents (Name Calling, Straw Men), appeals to group identity and fear (Flag-Waving, Appeal to Fear, Bandwagon), simplification of complex issues (Causal Oversimplification, Black & White), and self-promotion (Slogans, Repetition). The inclusion of donation requests and calls to join their platform further emphasizes its persuasive, rallying intent rather than informative purpose. While some factual elements exist (e.g., Trump posted about the fence), they are presented within a highly biased and manipulative framework.
