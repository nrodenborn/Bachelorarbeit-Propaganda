Verdict – 80% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, exaggeration, loaded language, and appeal to authority, among others. These techniques are used to influence the reader's perception of the case and the broader issues of immigration and justice. The presence of these techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is intended to persuade or manipulate the audience, rather than provide an objective account of the events.
