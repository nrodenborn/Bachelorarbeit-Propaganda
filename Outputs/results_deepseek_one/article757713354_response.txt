### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in "Not So Fast"

1. **Name calling – Yes**  
   Explanation: "stupidest acts," "wicked plan," "neocons," "junior sidekick" (referring to South Korea), "prickly North Koreans," "mouthpieces," "satrap," "minions," "bootlickers," "loud-mouthed neocon" (Nikki Haley).

2. **Repetition – Yes**  
   Explanation: Repeated references to "neocons" (9 times), John Bolton's role in sabotaging deals (2005-2006 and present), and Libya/Kadaffi outcomes.

3. **Slogans – No**  
   Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases used for persuasion (e.g., "Maximum Thunder" is a military exercise name, not a slogan).

4. **Appeal to fear – Yes**  
   Explanation: Implies North Korea could face Libya's fate ("murdered by French agents") if it denuclearizes.

5. **Doubt – Yes**  
   Explanation: Questions motives: "Was Trump involved in this intrigue?" and "Some wondered if Bolton and perhaps Pompeo were trying to sabotage the deal."

6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes**  
   Explanation: Exaggerates with "stupidest acts," "total surrender policy," and minimizes U.S. security concerns by framing demands as unreasonable ("eat sand and die").

7. **Flag-Waving – No**  
   Explanation: No appeals to patriotism or national identity; criticizes U.S. actions instead.

8. **Loaded Language – Yes**  
   Explanation: Emotionally charged terms like "wicked," "prickly," "furious," "provocation," "fanatically," "hapless," and "deceit."

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No**  
   Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis or Hitler.

10. **Bandwagon – Yes**  
    Explanation: References consensus among "veteran Korea observers, this writer included" to validate skepticism about denuclearization.

11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes**  
    Explanation: Blames John Bolton alone for sabotaging the 2005-2006 U.S.-North Korea deal, ignoring broader geopolitical factors.

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No**  
    Explanation: Arguments are direct; no deliberate ambiguity.

13. **Appeal to authority – Yes**  
    Explanation: Cites the author’s own expertise as a "veteran Korea observer" to bolster credibility.

14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes**  
    Explanation: Presents U.S. actions as either "stupid" or "wicked," and neocons as prioritizing Israel over U.S. interests with no nuance.

15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No**  
    Explanation: No phrases used to shut down critical analysis (e.g., "it is what it is").

16. **Red herring – Yes**  
    Explanation: Diverts to Iran ("Trump reneged on the sensible nuclear treaty") and Libya when discussing North Korea peace talks.

17. **Straw men – No**  
    Explanation: No misrepresentation of opposing arguments; critiques specific U.S. actions.

18. **Whataboutism – Yes**  
    Explanation: Shifts focus to U.S. nuclear weapons ("Why does North Korea not demand that the US get rid of its nuclear weapons?") instead of addressing North Korea’s commitments.

### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Use of Techniques**: Employs 12/18 identified techniques, including name-calling, loaded language, fear appeals, and whataboutism.  
2. **Persuasive Framing**: Presents a one-sided narrative that vilifies U.S. "neocons" (e.g., Bolton, Pompeo) while sympathizing with North Korea’s reactions. Complex issues are reduced to simplistic villainy (e.g., Bolton as sole saboteur).  
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses inflammatory language ("wicked," "murdered," "deceit") and historical parallels (Libya) to provoke anger/distrust toward U.S. policy.  
4. **Omission of Context**: Ignores North Korea’s aggression (e.g., nuclear tests, human rights abuses) and frames U.S. military exercises as unprovoked "saber-rattling."  
5. **Author Bias**: The writer positions themselves as an expert to validate claims while dismissing diplomatic progress ("Smiles and hugs are premature").  

While based on factual events (e.g., canceled talks, Bolton’s Libya comments), the text selectively curates evidence to advance an anti-U.S./anti-neocon agenda, characteristic of persuasive propaganda. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the use of verifiable facts, but the overwhelming rhetorical slant indicates propagandistic intent.
