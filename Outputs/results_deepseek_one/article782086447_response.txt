### Propaganda Technique Analysis  

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "disastrous pontificate of Pope Francis" (insulting label).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – "cover-up," "sanctions," "resign" repeated to emphasize accusations.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Do not be afraid!" (memorable phrase urging action).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings of the Church being "disfigured by so many abominable crimes" and "strangled" by homosexual networks.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions credibility of Cardinals (e.g., "Cardinal Wuerl also clearly lied," "how can his answer be explained?").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates with terms like "unprecedented in modern times," "fetid swamp," and "conspiracy of silence." Minimizes opposing views (e.g., dismisses Cardinal Farrell’s denial as unbelievable).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to Catholic identity: "restore the beauty of holiness to the face of the Bride of Christ," "defend the Church."  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotionally charged terms: "abominable crimes," "pervert," "deviated wing," "wicked pact."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Compares Church secrecy to the mafia: "a conspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the mafia."  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "a chorus of voices is rising... joined by several bishops" to demand resignations (appeal to growing support).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames the crisis solely on "homosexual networks" while ignoring systemic/structural factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – References unnamed "homosexual networks," "others belonging to this current," and "prelates in the Vatican" without specifics.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Monsignor Lantheaume, scripture (Luke 12:3), and Pope Benedict XVI as moral authorities.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents only two choices: Pope Francis resigns or enables evil (e.g., "Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example... and resign").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Do not be afraid!" and "eradicate homosexual networks" halt critical discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Diverts to Georgetown University’s "morally unacceptable event" when discussing McCarrick.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – No clear misrepresentation of an unstated argument; critiques specific actions/statements.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Focuses on Pope Francis’s actions without accusing him of hypocrisy via unrelated comparisons.

### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** (85%) due to its systematic use of persuasive techniques to manipulate emotions, discredit opponents, and demand specific actions (e.g., papal resignation). Key indicators:  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language (e.g., "abominable crimes") and fear appeals (e.g., Church "strangled" by corruption) dominate.  
- **Selective Framing**: Presents a one-sided narrative accusing Pope Francis of a cover-up while ignoring counter-evidence or context.  
- **Moral Polarization**: Uses black/white fallacies (e.g., resign or enable evil) and religious authority to frame the issue as a battle between holiness and corruption.  
- **Repetition & Sloganeering**: Repeats keywords ("cover-up," "resign") and rallying cries ("Do not be afraid!") to reinforce the message.  
- **Obfuscation**: Vague references to "homosexual networks" create boogeymen without substantiation.  
- **Goal-Oriented**: Clearly aims to mobilize readers against Church leadership, not invite balanced debate.  

**Why not 100%?**  
The text includes factual claims (e.g., McCarrick’s sanctions, documented memos) that anchor it in real events. However, these are embedded within a manipulative structure exaggerating their significance and omitting counter-narratives, reducing objectivity. The blend of verifiable details with aggressive persuasion tactics aligns with propaganda’s goal to influence through partial truths.
