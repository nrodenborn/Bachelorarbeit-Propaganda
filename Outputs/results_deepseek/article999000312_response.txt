Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

**Propaganda Technique Analysis:**
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "MI6 mouthpiece Luke Harding", "blatant MI6 lies", "particularly obnoxious defeated candidate" (Hillary Clinton), "patheticly failed attempt" (Mueller investigation).

3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings about "state control of propaganda", "elite control" of media, and Assange's extradition/espionage charges.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "the FBI did not even themselves look at the DNC servers", questioning Mueller's credibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "greatest publisher of his age", "most astonishing thing". Minimization: Mueller's investigation as "pathetically failed attempt".

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Those are the facts" used to shut down counterarguments about Assange/Manafort/DNC.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All arguments relate to core claims.

18. **Whataboutism** – No – No deflection via accusations of hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 85% –**  
The text is highly likely propaganda due to:  
1. **Systematic use of manipulative techniques**: Heavy reliance on name-calling, loaded language, repetition, and appeals to authority to discredit opponents (Guardian, Mueller, US/UK governments).  
2. **Emotional persuasion**: Strongly worded accusations ("lies," "fabrications") and fear-mongering about media/state control.  
3. **One-sided narrative**: Presents Assange as an innocent martyr while dismissing all opposing claims as fabricated conspiracies. No counter-evidence is acknowledged.  
4. **Conspiracy framing**: Asserts coordination between governments, intelligence agencies, and media to "overturn" election results and imprison Assange.  
5. **Selective facts**: Uses logistical details (embassy security protocols) to build credibility but ignores contradictory evidence (e.g., Mueller’s findings).  
6. **Purpose**: Clearly aims to delegitimize critics, rally support for Assange, and reinforce a specific worldview (e.g., "liberal media is dead").  

While it contains factual elements (e.g., embassy security procedures), their presentation is manipulated to serve a partisan agenda. The text fits propaganda criteria by overwhelming readers with emotive, repetitive claims designed to provoke outrage rather than encourage critical analysis.
