1. Name calling – Yes – Explanation: The text refers to Senator Dick Durbin as “Dicky Durban” and a “complete FRAUD.”

2. Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The poll question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is repeated three times in a row. The central theme of the Democrats' "double standard" is also repeated multiple times by Juanita Broaddrick.

3. Slogans – No – Explanation: The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea.

4. Appeal to fear – No – Explanation: The text does not attempt to instill fear in the audience about alternatives. It focuses on accusing opponents of hypocrisy.

5. Doubt – Yes – Explanation: The text is built around casting doubt on the motives of Democrats like Feinstein and Schumer, suggesting their concern for Christine Blasey Ford is not genuine. It also casts doubt on Ford's accusation by calling it "flimsy and meritless."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: The text minimizes the accusation against Kavanaugh by calling it "flimsy and meritless," while the statement "The Clinton machine did nothing but shut down Broaddrick and paint her as a liar" is an exaggeration of events.

7. Flag-Waving – No – Explanation: The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity. Its appeal is based on partisan politics.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “Clinton machine,” “lashed out,” “flimsy and meritless accusations,” and “complete FRAUD” to evoke an emotional response.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation: The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or groups hated by the audience.

10. Bandwagon – No – Explanation: The text does not suggest an idea is good because it is popular.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: The text simplifies the different responses to the Broaddrick and Ford allegations to a single cause: a "double standard" and political hypocrisy, ignoring other complex factors like the different time periods, political contexts, and specifics of each case.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanation: The text is direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation: The text presents Juanita Broaddrick as an authority on her own experience and the hypocrisy of Democrats. It also cites the Washington Times and Fox News, which are presented as authoritative sources.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation: The text presents the situation as a binary choice: either Democrats are hypocrites for not investigating Broaddrick's claim with the same vigor as Ford's, or they must investigate both. This ignores other possibilities and nuances in the situation.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation: Phrases like “It’s absurd” and “That shows you the difference in the double standard that existed back then and still does today” are used to present a conclusion as self-evident and discourage deeper critical thought.

16. Red herring – Yes – Explanation: The inclusion of a poll, repeated three times, about who should replace Nikki Haley as U.N. ambassador is completely irrelevant to the topic of the article and serves as a distraction.

17. Straw men – Yes – Explanation: The text refutes the implied argument that only Christine Blasey Ford's accusation is worthy of investigation. By demanding her own case be reopened, Broaddrick attacks a simplified version of the Democrats' position, which was focused on the specific Kavanaugh nomination at hand, not making a universal statement about all past allegations.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – Explanation: This is the primary technique used in the entire text. It deflects criticism or concern about the Kavanaugh allegation by redirecting the focus to the past actions of Democrats regarding the Bill Clinton allegation, charging them with hypocrisy ("Where was mine?").

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and powerful example of propaganda. Its entire structure is built upon the technique of **Whataboutism**, deflecting from the contemporary issue of the Kavanaugh accusation by raising the past issue of the Clinton accusation to charge opponents with hypocrisy. This core argument is supported by a multitude of other techniques. It uses emotionally **Loaded Language** ("Clinton machine," "flimsy") and direct **Name Calling** ("FRAUD") to create a strong negative emotional response toward the subjects of the article. It casts **Doubt** on the motives of Democrats and the credibility of Kavanaugh's accuser. The argument is framed using a **Black & White Fallacy** and **Causal Oversimplification**, reducing a complex political situation to a simple "double standard." The piece even includes a blatant **Red Herring** in the form of an unrelated political poll, likely to distract and gather user data. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to persuade the audience through emotional manipulation and logical fallacies rather than to inform them objectively.
