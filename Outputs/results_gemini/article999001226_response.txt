1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Senator Marco Rubio as a “RINO extraordinaire,” which is an insulting label (“Republican In Name Only”).

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?” is repeated three times in a row.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases that are repeated to encapsulate an idea.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states that action must be taken “before more people end up dead in Broward County over their corrupt voting practices,” instilling fear of deadly consequences if the author’s demands are not met.

5. Doubt – Yes – The opening sentence, “Why she wasn't fired a long time ago is beyond anyone's ability to answer,” is designed to cast doubt on Brenda Snipes’s competence and the integrity of the system that employed her.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the situation by stating, “She should be ready for prison bars after the fiasco she has created” and that her arrest “should be imminent,” presenting a desired outcome as a certainty.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the identity of the people of Florida by stating, “that should not be good enough for the people of Broward County nor the state of Florida,” and frames the issue as a crime “against the people of Broward County.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like “fiasco,” “botched,” “blistering criticism,” “illegally,” and “corrupt” to influence the reader's perception of events.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other groups widely hated by the audience.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not explicitly argue that an idea is correct because it is popular or that "everyone" believes it.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents the complex situation of election recounts and discrepancies as being caused simply by the direct, intentional fraud of one person: “what is clearly voter fraud that she oversaw.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations, not intentionally vague or obscure.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites Senator Marco Rubio, Breitbart, the Naples Daily News, and federal prosecutors to support its claims.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll about Jim Acosta presents a false dichotomy in its answers: “Yes, he should have gotten it back” versus “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass,” ignoring nuanced positions and loading one option with an insult.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down critical thought.

16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about CNN reporter Jim Acosta is introduced in the middle of the article. It is completely irrelevant to the topic of Brenda Snipes and the Florida election and serves only to distract the reader.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text says, “but don't worry, a Democrat attorney says that doing so has nothing to do with fraud or corruption.” This misrepresents a potential nuanced legal argument (e.g., that procedural errors do not meet the legal definition of fraud) as a flippant dismissal of any wrongdoing, making it easier to attack.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism of a subject by accusing an opponent of a similar offense.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. It employs a majority of the listed techniques to construct a one-sided narrative designed to provoke an emotional response rather than a rational one. The article is saturated with loaded language (“fiasco,” “corrupt”), appeals to fear (predicting people will “end up dead”), and exaggeration (“She should be ready for prison bars”). It simplifies a complex legal and political situation into a simple story of a single villain who must be arrested. Furthermore, it uses a blatant red herring (the Jim Acosta poll) to distract and engage the reader on an unrelated, emotionally charged topic. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to persuade and incite the audience to a specific conclusion, rather than to inform them objectively.
