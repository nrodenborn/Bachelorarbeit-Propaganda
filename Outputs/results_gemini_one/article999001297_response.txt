1. Name calling – Yes – The embedded tweet from Charlie Kirk labels the event a "national disgrace," which is an insulting label for the situation. The poll about Jim Acosta also contains the option "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass," applying the insulting label "child" to the journalist.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – Yes – The quote from Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, "Border security is national security," is a brief, memorable phrase used to encapsulate a political position.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The headline "Migrant Caravan Reach Border & Climb Atop Fencing Effortlessly" suggests a lack of security and an easy invasion, which can instill fear about the nation's safety.
5. Doubt – No – The text presents information and quotes from sources without actively trying to question the credibility of an opposing person or viewpoint.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline's use of the word "effortlessly" is a subjective exaggeration designed to make the border fence seem ineffective and the crossing seem easy.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The quote "Border security is national security" is a direct appeal to patriotism, linking the issue to the safety and identity of the nation.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The phrase "national disgrace" in the embedded tweet is emotionally loaded. Similarly, the poll option describing a journalist's actions as being "like a child" uses loaded language to evoke a negative emotional response.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or other universally hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct simply because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The embedded tweet, "The caravan is here, illegally entering America This is a national disgrace Arrest and deport them all back to their home country," reduces the complex issue of migration driven by economic and social factors to a simple criminal act.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article's language is generally direct and not deliberately obscure or confusing.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article heavily quotes and embeds tweets from authorities like "US Customs and Border Patrol San Diego" and "Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen" to lend credibility to its narrative.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll on Jim Acosta presents a false dichotomy in its "No" option: "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass." This forces a choice between supporting him or agreeing with the assertion that he acted "like a child," ignoring other possibilities.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "Border security is national security" is used as a simple, powerful statement intended to discourage further critical thought or discussion on the nuances of the issue.
16. Red herring – Yes – The article is about the migrant caravan, but it prominently features a repeated poll about whether journalist Jim Acosta should have his press pass back. This is an irrelevant topic used to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – No – The article does not misrepresent an opponent's argument in order to refute it. It primarily focuses on presenting its own narrative.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect from the topic by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs a wide array of propaganda techniques not to inform, but to persuade the reader toward a specific viewpoint. The framing begins with the headline, which uses exaggeration ("effortlessly") and appeals to fear by suggesting the nation's border is easily breached. It uses a significant red herring (the poll about Jim Acosta) to distract and to reinforce a partisan worldview. The piece relies heavily on appeals to authority and patriotism ("Border security is national security") to validate its perspective, while also including loaded language ("national disgrace," "act like a child") to provoke an emotional response. By oversimplifying the complex issue of migration into a simple matter of illegal entry, it discourages critical thought, a goal further supported by the use of thought-terminating clichés. The combination of these techniques shows a clear intent to manipulate the reader's perception rather than provide a neutral, balanced account of the event.
