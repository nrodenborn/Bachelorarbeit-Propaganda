Here's the analysis of the text based on the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to the vaccine, the WHO, or other subjects. Descriptions like "experimental" and "feared" are factual or descriptive.
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated excessively to drive a point.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as slogans (e.g., no rallying cry like "Stop Ebola Now!").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the dangers of Ebola are described (symptoms, mortality rate, spread potential), the tone is informational and cautionary rather than overtly trying to instill fear to push a specific agenda *against alternatives*. It presents the vaccine as a response, not the *only* solution due to fear.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The credibility of the WHO, health officials, or the vaccine effort is not questioned. Statements from authorities are reported straightforwardly.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The descriptions of Ebola (symptoms, transmission, mortality rates) are factual and align with known medical information. The experimental nature of the vaccine/drug is clearly stated without downplaying or exaggerating it.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity (like "we must protect our nation" or "true Congolese").
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is generally neutral and descriptive. Terms like "feared," "terrifying," "deadly," and "alarm" are contextually appropriate for a serious disease outbreak and not used excessively or purely for emotional manipulation. "Experimental" is factual.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There are no comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally hated groups to disapprove of the vaccine, the outbreak, or the response.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not argue for adopting the vaccine because it's popular or others are doing it. It's presented as a specific public health measure.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The complexity of the outbreak and response is acknowledged (urban spread risks, targeting contacts, international concerns). No single simple cause is blamed.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is relatively clear and specific about the disease, the vaccine rollout plan (who, where), the experimental nature, transmission methods, and statistics (e.g., "26 dead", "up to 90%" mortality, "600 people" initially targeted).
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites statements and warnings from authorities like the Minister of Health (Oly Ilunga), The World Health Organization (WHO), and generic "authorities" to support the seriousness of the situation and the response (e.g., "Minister of Health Oly Ilunga told...", "The World Health Organization has been warning...", "according to authorities", "the World Health Organization has warned").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text doesn't present the situation or solutions as having only two extreme choices. It describes the planned response (vaccine targeting specific groups) and mentions another therapeutic (ZMapp) without framing it as an either/or or the only possible actions.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking (e.g., "it's just common sense", "trust the science" uncritically). The experimental nature is clearly stated, and ZMapp's results are noted as not definitive.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the Ebola outbreak, the vaccine rollout, the disease characteristics, and the containment efforts. No irrelevant topics are introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that wasn't actually made. It reports facts and statements.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse any person or group involved in the Ebola response of hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated actions or failings.

**Verdict – 15% –** The text primarily functions as straightforward news reporting on a developing public health crisis. It relays factual information about the Ebola virus, the outbreak's status, and the official response (the experimental vaccine rollout), citing relevant authorities like the Congolese Health Minister and the WHO. The description of Ebola's dangers is consistent with medical understanding and presented in a contextually appropriate, cautionary manner, not overtly manipulative. The one identifiable technique is "Appeal to Authority," which is standard and often necessary in news reporting to establish the source and credibility of information, especially concerning official actions and health warnings. However, its use here is informative rather than manipulative propaganda. The overall tone is informational, not polemical, and lacks the hallmarks of most major propaganda techniques like loaded language, fear-mongering, name-calling, or logical fallacies designed to manipulate opinion on a controversial issue. The 15% reflects the minor presence of "Appeal to Authority" within an otherwise factual report.
