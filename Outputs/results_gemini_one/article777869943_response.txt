1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to describe the compound, referring to it as a "filthy compound," a "wretched compound," and a "horrid compound."
2. Repetition – Yes – The article repeatedly emphasizes the central message that the police response was too slow. For example, Tanya Badger is quoted saying, "They were dragging their feet. They were taking too long," and later, "We are just beyond frustrated that they took so long."
3. Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text supports the idea that the police should have acted sooner by highlighting the danger to the children. Tanya Badger is quoted saying, "a child's life is at stake," which instills fear about the consequences of the delay.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is framed to question the credibility and competence of the police. The headline, "Couple question why police waited so long to search New Mexico compound," and the section "Compound wasn't searched thoroughly, couple say" are direct examples of casting doubt on the official actions.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The article reports on different perspectives (e.g., "exorcism" vs. "ruqya") rather than using exaggeration or minimization in its own narrative voice.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's perception, such as "starving children," "horrifying scene," "dirty rags," and "wretched compound."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The article explores the complexity of the situation, including the sheriff's reasoning about probable cause, rather than assigning a simple cause to the event.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text aims to provide clarity on the events and different viewpoints, not to intentionally confuse the reader.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses statements from authorities as evidence. For example, it quotes Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe to explain the police's position: "I had no probable cause to go onto this property." It also cites the arrest warrant and police reports.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The article presents more than two options or perspectives, including those of the couple, the sheriff, and the missing boy's mother.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – The article stays focused on the central topic and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract.
17. Straw men – No – The article presents direct arguments and counter-arguments from the involved parties rather than misrepresenting and refuting a false argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge any party with hypocrisy on an unrelated matter.

***

Verdict – 40% – The text is a news report and not a piece of overt propaganda, as it maintains a journalistic structure by presenting multiple viewpoints (the couple, the sheriff). However, it heavily employs several propaganda techniques to frame the narrative in a way that is highly critical of the police response and to evoke a strong emotional reaction from the reader. The core of the article is built on the technique of **Doubt**, and this is reinforced through **Repetition** of the key criticism ("they took too long"). The use of strong **Loaded Language** ("horrifying," "wretched," "starving") and an **Appeal to fear** ("a child's life is at stake") are central to shaping the reader's perception. While it does **Appeal to authority** by quoting the sheriff, it is done within a narrative that questions his judgment. The techniques are used to create a specific, emotionally charged angle, which blurs the line between objective reporting and persuasive, propagandistic writing.
