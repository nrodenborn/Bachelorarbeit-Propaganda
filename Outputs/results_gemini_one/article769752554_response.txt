5. Doubt – No – The text reports the claims from various sources without actively questioning the credibility of any person or group involved.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text quotes the mother’s post calling the man the “scum bag of the year,” which is an exaggeration. The included tweet, “The civility of the Left on full display…”, sarcastically exaggerates the actions of one individual to represent an entire political group.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites multiple news outlets (KENS5, Breitbart, CBS, NBC) and mentions that “A police report was filed” to lend credibility and authority to its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The narrative frames the incident as a simple binary conflict between an innocent teenager expressing his political support and a hateful aggressor from “the Left,” ignoring any other potential nuances of the confrontation.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase from the embedded tweet, “The civility of the Left on full display…”, is a sarcastic, dismissive cliché intended to end discussion and frame the event as definitive proof of a political group's negative character.
16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on the incident and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – No – The text reports on a direct incident and does not create and refute a false argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any party of hypocrisy by pointing to other supposed wrongdoings.

Verdict – 90% – The text presents itself as a news report, but it is heavily structured to promote a specific political viewpoint, making it highly propagandistic. While it reports on a real event, the way it is framed utilizes numerous propaganda techniques. The article selectively uses loaded language ("attacked," "disturbing") and quotes (the mother's "scum bag of the year" comment) to evoke an emotional response. The most significant piece of propaganda is the inclusion of the tweet from "The Columbia Bugle." This tweet uses causal oversimplification, a thought-terminating cliché, and flag-waving to transform an individual assault into an indictment of an entire political ideology ("the Left"). This creates a black-and-white narrative of innocent patriots versus violent political opponents. By leaning on these techniques rather than objective reporting, the text's primary purpose shifts from informing the reader to persuading them of a particular political narrative.
