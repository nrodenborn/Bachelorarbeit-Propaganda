Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Adulterers" (in the headline), "Dictator Pope," "tyrannical and unprincipled papacy."

4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "The Mystical Body would then be without its head" implies catastrophic consequences.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions the legitimacy of papal actions: "heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial."

---

**Verdict – 75% –** The text exhibits significant propaganda techniques, including **Name Calling** ("Dictator Pope," "adulterers"), **Appeal to Fear** (threat of a headless Church), **Loaded Language** ("tyrannical," "heresy"), and **Black & White Fallacy** (framing theology as strictly orthodox/heretical). It selectively cites authorities (Aquinas, Burke) to delegitimize Pope Francis while ignoring counterarguments. The emotive language and one-sided portrayal of the Communion controversy aim to provoke outrage rather than encourage balanced discourse. However, it avoids some techniques (e.g., **Bandwagon**, **Obfuscation**), and its use of direct quotes/rescripts provides partial factual grounding. Overall, the text is heavily persuasive and polemical, aligning strongly with propaganda objectives.
