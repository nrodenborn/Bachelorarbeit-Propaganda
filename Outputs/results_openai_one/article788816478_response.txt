Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, and appeal to authority. These elements suggest a biased presentation intended to discredit Ford and support Kavanaugh's confirmation. The use of emotionally charged language and questioning of credibility are indicative of an attempt to sway public opinion, which aligns with the characteristics of propaganda. However, the text does not employ all possible techniques, and some sections present factual information, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood of it being pure propaganda.
