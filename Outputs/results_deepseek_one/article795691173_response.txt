Here's the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against the subject (Saudi government, Khashoggi, US officials). Terms like "dissident Saudi journalist" and "Saudi regime" are descriptive, not inherently insulting in this context.
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries (e.g., no equivalent to "BUILD THE WALL").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the details of Khashoggi's disappearance (torture, beheading) are disturbing and could evoke fear, the text reports allegations made by Turkish authorities. It does not use these details explicitly to support a specific course of action by instilling fear against alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text reports Saudi denials ("denied... any knowledge") and US officials calling for investigation/facts, but it doesn't actively frame statements to cast explicit, unfounded doubt on a specific entity's credibility.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The reported allegations (torture, beheading) are severe, but they are attributed to sources (Turkish authorities/media). The text itself does not appear to exaggerate or minimize facts beyond reporting these claims and the Saudi denial. The US administration's stance ("reluctance") is reported factually.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There are no appeals to patriotism, national identity, or "us vs. them" sentiments based on nationality. The focus is on international pressure and the specifics of the case.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Potential, but weak. – Words like "suspected murder," "tortured," "beheaded," "dissident," "rebuke," "pressure," "criticism," and "mounting pressure" carry strong connotations. However, these terms are generally factual descriptors of the situation or attributed claims, rather than overt appeals to emotion or stereotypes *by the author* to manipulate. It stays within typical journalistic reporting of serious allegations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally condemned groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "Trade and finance ministers from Britain, France, Holland and other countries, the head of the International Monetary Fund, as well as CEOs of multiple major companies already had withdrawn in protest, and Mnuchin was under growing pressure to add his name to the list." This explicitly highlights the popularity of the withdrawal action to show momentum and pressure on Mnuchin.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The complexity of the international incident and political pressures are acknowledged. No single simple cause is presented as the explanation for the event or the US response.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and factual. Key details (who, what, when, where, statements from officials) are presented straightforwardly. Pompeo's phrases like "serious nature," "thorough and timely," "transparent," and "complete understanding of the facts" are diplomatic but not intentionally obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Statements from officials (Mnuchin, Pompeo, Trump, Saudi King/Prince) are reported as part of the news event, but they are not used as the *sole* or unquestionable evidence to support a specific claim within the propaganda sense. The text also includes counterpoints (Turkish claims, congressional pressure).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents multiple perspectives (US administration wanting time/investigation, Saudi denial, Turkish allegations, international/congressional pressure) and nuances like Pompeo stressing Saudi Arabia's strategic importance. It doesn't frame the situation as only two stark choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used to shut down critical thinking (e.g., "it is what it is," "trust the plan"). Phrases like "allow the process to move forward, allow the facts to unfold" reflect a stated policy approach, not a cliché meant to end discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the Khashoggi case, Mnuchin's withdrawal, the US administration's response, and the surrounding facts/pressures. No irrelevant topics are introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text reports statements and positions directly. It doesn't misrepresent or refute an argument that wasn't actually made.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No attempt is made to deflect criticism of Saudi Arabia or the US administration by accusing critics of hypocrisy on other issues.

**Verdict – 10% –** The text is overwhelmingly standard news reporting. It presents facts (actions taken, statements made by officials, allegations from sources), provides context (international withdrawals, political pressure), and includes multiple perspectives (US administration, Saudi government, Turkish authorities, Congress). While it reports disturbing allegations and uses some strong descriptive terms common in journalism, it does so without overtly employing most propaganda techniques. The strongest case is for **Bandwagon** (highlighting others withdrawing to show pressure on Mnuchin), which is a mild use common even in non-propaganda contexts to show momentum. The primary purpose appears to be informative, not manipulative. The low percentage reflects the presence of the Bandwagon element and the inherent subjectivity in interpreting loaded language within journalism, but the core of the text lacks the hallmarks of propaganda.
