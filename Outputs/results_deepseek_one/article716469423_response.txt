### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation:* No insulting labels are applied to any subject; the text discusses solar phenomena neutrally.

2. **Repetition** – Yes  
   *Explanation:* The core idea of the sun "dimming" and an approaching "ice age" is repeated throughout (e.g., "sun is going dark," "decline in total solar irradiance," "mini ice age").  

3. **Slogans** – Yes  
   *Explanation:* The headline "The Sun Is Going DARK" acts as a memorable, alarmist phrase to capture attention.  

4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes  
   *Explanation:* Predicts catastrophic events like a "15-year long mini ice age," "huge seismic events," and "destabilization of the Earth’s crust" to evoke dread.  

5. **Doubt** – Yes  
   *Explanation:* Questions mainstream climate science by claiming the warning "will infuriate environmental campaigners," casting doubt on their credibility.  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes  
   *Explanation:* Exaggerates solar impacts (e.g., "barrage of cataclysmic events," "plunging global temperatures") while minimizing alternative climate factors.  

7. **Flag-Waving** – No  
   *Explanation:* No appeals to patriotism or national identity; the focus is global.  

8. **Loaded Language** – Yes  
   *Explanation:* Uses emotionally charged terms like "cataclysmic events," "destabilization," and "hibernation" to provoke anxiety.  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *Explanation:* No comparisons to hated groups (e.g., Nazis) or ideologies.  

10. **Bandwagon** – Yes  
    *Explanation:* Cites multiple sources (NASA, Spaceweather, The Express UK, Space and Science Research Center) to imply consensus on the ice-age claim.  

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes  
    *Explanation:* Attributes complex climate shifts solely to sunspots (e.g., "as the sun gets quieter...our magnetic field gets weaker," linking this directly to an ice age).  

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes  
    *Explanation:* Vague terms like "strong link," "destabilization," and "more than possible" obscure scientific nuance.  

13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes  
    *Explanation:* Repeatedly cites NASA, SpaceX, and research centers to legitimize the claims (e.g., "NASA’s own data," "Scientists say").  

14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes  
    *Explanation:* Presents a false dichotomy: either accept the "mini ice age" theory or side with "environmental campaigners" ignoring "glacial melt."  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes  
    *Explanation:* Phrases like "I don’t know" and "this is as vanilla as you can possibly make it" dismiss deeper scrutiny of the claims.  

16. **Red herring** – Yes  
    *Explanation:* Introduces irrelevant anger of "environmental campaigners" to distract from the lack of evidence for an imminent ice age.  

17. **Straw men** – Yes  
    *Explanation:* Misrepresents climate science by reducing it to "increased sea levels and flooding due to glacial melt," ignoring broader consensus on global warming.  

18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    *Explanation:* No accusations of hypocrisy targeting opponents.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of manipulative techniques. It employs **appeal to fear** (catastrophic ice age), **exaggeration** (seismic events, "destabilization"), **causal oversimplification** (attributing climate shifts solely to sunspots), and **bandwagon/appeal to authority** (citing NASA selectively) to advance a sensationalist narrative. It constructs a **false dichotomy** between the ice-age theory and mainstream climate science, while **obfuscation** and **loaded language** obscure the lack of robust evidence. The framing of environmental scientists as "infuriated" opponents and the use of **straw men** further reveal an agenda to discredit consensus views. Though it references scientific entities, it cherry-picks data to fuel alarmism—a hallmark of propaganda aimed at undermining trust in established science.
