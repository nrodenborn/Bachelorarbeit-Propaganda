### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Persuasive Framing**: The title "From Bad To Worse?" and loaded language (e.g., "Deep State," "torture program") frame events negatively to sway opinion.  
2. **Selective Sourcing**: Relies heavily on critics (Snowden, Greenwald) while omitting counter-perspectives, creating a one-sided narrative.  
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses fear ("skulls and lightning bolts"), outrage ("un-American," "criminal activity"), and appeals to identity to provoke strong reactions.  
4. **Omission of Context**: Details Tillerson’s firing but glosses over policy disagreements, emphasizing drama (e.g., "voice quivering") over substantive analysis.  
5. **Reinforcement Techniques**: Repetition, slogans, and bandwagon appeals amplify the message’s reach and perceived legitimacy.  
6. **Ideological Alignment**: The article’s permission from "Sons of Liberty Media" (a known partisan outlet) and cryptocurrency donation plea signal a partisan agenda.  

While based on factual events (e.g., Trump’s tweet, Tillerson’s firing), the text’s **dominant intent is to persuade**, not inform neutrally. It cherry-picks data, uses emotionally charged rhetoric, and cites aligned authorities to condemn the appointments, meeting key propaganda criteria. The 15% non-propaganda element reflects objective reporting (e.g., quoting Trump’s tweet, describing Tillerson’s departure timeline).
