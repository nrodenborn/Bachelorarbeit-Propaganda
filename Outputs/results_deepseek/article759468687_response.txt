### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Infidels" (used repeatedly as an insulting label for non-Muslims), "plunderers of holy lands" (referring to Jewish tourists).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "Ramadan is the month of jihad" (repeated 4+ times), "Infidels" (repeated 6+ times).  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "Ramadan is the month of jihad" (brief, memorable phrase central to the text’s argument).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "Murdering infidels thus doesn’t contradict the spirit of Ramadan; it embodies it" and warnings like "more Infidels will die" instill fear about Ramadan.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Trump was... severely misleading the American people" questions Trump’s credibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "Ramadan is quintessentially the month of jihad" (frames Ramadan solely as violent). Minimization: Dismisses positive views of Ramadan (e.g., Trump’s statement) as misleading.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "misleading the American people" appeals to American identity/national concern.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "murdered," "calamity," "severe against disbelievers," "dangerous, suicidal folly," "willful blindness" (emotionally charged, negative terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to universally hated groups (e.g., Nazis).  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to the popularity of the idea (focuses on theological/ideological claims, not popularity).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes all Ramadan violence to Islamic doctrine ("Islam’s core beliefs make it clear"), ignoring complex socio-political factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Language is direct and inflammatory, not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites jihadist groups ("Kavkaz Center"), the Qur’an (48:29), and a "jihad group" to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents only two options: Ramadan as a violent "month of jihad" vs. a falsely "rich" cultural experience ("So which is it?").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Islam’s core beliefs make it clear" shuts down debate by implying immutable truth.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The embedded poll ("Whom do you consider the most corrupt Democrat Politician?") distracts from the topic.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents Shadi Hamid’s critique as trying to "absolve the Muslim community of any responsibility," ignoring his actual point about stereotyping.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy against critics.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic, employing **13 of 18 techniques** to advance a biased, fear-driven narrative. Key indicators include:  
- **Dehumanizing language** ("Infidels," "murdered") and **repetition** of inflammatory claims to vilify Muslims and frame Ramadan as inherently violent.  
- **Appeals to fear** and **religious authority** (Qur’an citations, jihadist sources) are used to validate the thesis while **dismissing counter-narratives** (e.g., Trump’s statement) as deliberate deception.  
- **Oversimplification** reduces terrorism to Islamic doctrine alone, ignoring geopolitical contexts. The **black-and-white fallacy** ("which is it?") forces false dichotomies, and the **red herring** (Democrat poll) distracts readers.  
- **Sourcing bias** is evident: Jihadist groups are treated as authoritative, while mainstream Muslim perspectives (e.g., Hamid’s critique) are misrepresented via a **straw man**.  
- The **agenda is transparent**: To link Islam inextricably to violence and pressure readers into accepting a singular, alarmist worldview. While factual elements exist (e.g., reporting attacks), their framing is manipulative and exclusionary. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the use of real citations (Qur’an, Kavkaz Center), though their interpretation is skewed to serve propaganda.
