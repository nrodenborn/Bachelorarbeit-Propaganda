Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack opponents, such as describing the UK government as “the enemies of their own people” and Islam as a “Mohammedan cult”.

Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is repeated three times in a row. Also, the phrase “Free Tommy Robinson!” is repeated as a central message.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses the hashtag slogan “#FreeTommy Robinson” and the rallying cry from a speaker, “The British are coming back!”

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text repeatedly instills fear of Islam and Muslim immigration, citing threats like “widespread, organized, paedophile rape of little girls,” “ISIS fighters to return from Syria and threaten our safety,” and “Islamic terrorists and rape gangs.”

Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the credibility and motives of the UK government and legal system through a series of rhetorical questions, such as: “Why is it so easy for our state to jail Tommy Robinson, when it is so difficult to jail a group of men found with an underage girl in a bedroom?”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the threat of Islam by stating that monstrous crimes are committed in its name “all over this country every day” and describes the UK government as “the enemies of their own people.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by invoking American and British history, such as the reference to Paul Revere and the concluding line, “The British are coming back!” It also references “our country stands for and our traditional way of life.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases designed to evoke a strong reaction, such as “tyrannical arrest,” “monstrous crimes,” “paedophile rape,” and describing face coverings as a “black sack.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis to discredit an idea or group.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text emphasizes the popularity of the movement by highlighting the crowd size in the headline, “#FreeTommy Robinson Rally Draws Tens Of Thousands,” and quoting a speaker who called it a “Fantastic crowd!”

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies complex issues like crime rates and government policy by attributing them to a single cause: the “Islamisation” of the UK and the government’s submission to it. For example: “The UK is frightened of the Islamists, and by being frightened into submission, they are being complicit in the crimes of the devout Muslims there.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague or intentionally obscure; its language is direct, blunt, and makes very clear, though often unsubstantiated, accusations.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text lists the titles of the speakers, such as “UKIP leader Gerard Batten” and “Dutch opposition leader Geert Wilders,” to lend credibility and authority to their statements.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two choices in a complex situation. For example, a speaker is quoted as saying, “You either submit, or you resist. Are you going to submit? … Are you going to resist?”

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author uses a phrase to discourage critical thought after a long list of rhetorical questions: “Well, the questions are obviously rhetorical. We know why.” This asserts a shared, unquestionable understanding and ends the discussion.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a completely irrelevant poll in the middle of the article: “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” This has no connection to the #FreeTommy Robinson rally in the UK and serves as a distraction.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents an opponent’s position to make it easier to attack. For example, it reframes the sentiment to “not look back in anger” after a terrorist attack as an expectation to “immediately forget” the murder of children, which is an easier position to argue against.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text repeatedly deflects from the issue at hand (the legality of Tommy Robinson’s arrest) by charging hypocrisy, using a series of questions that start with “Why is it so easy... [to punish our side], but so difficult... [to punish your side]?” For example: “Why is it so easy, Theresa May, to jail Tommy Robinson, but so difficult to do anything at all about the monstrous crimes committed in the name of Islam...?”

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. It is not a neutral journalistic report but an advocacy article designed to persuade the reader by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques rather than objective facts and balanced analysis.

The article utilizes 16 of the 18 listed techniques. It is built on a foundation of **Appeal to Fear**, using highly **Loaded Language** (“monstrous crimes,” “paedophile rape”) to create an emotional response against a target group. It employs **Name Calling** (“enemies of their own people,” “Mohammedan cult”) to dehumanize opponents and uses a **Black & White Fallacy** (“a struggle between good and evil,” “You either submit, or you resist”) to eliminate nuance.

The entire argument is framed using logical fallacies like **Whataboutism** and **Doubt** to question the motives of the state, and **Causal Oversimplification** to blame all societal ills on a single cause (“Islamisation”). It builds a sense of in-group identity through **Flag-Waving** (Paul Revere, “traditional way of life”) and **Bandwagon** appeals (emphasizing the large crowd).

Furthermore, the inclusion of a completely irrelevant **Red Herring** poll and the use of **Thought-Terminating Clichés** (“We know why”) demonstrate a clear intent to manipulate the reader and shut down critical thinking. The text’s purpose is not to inform but to inflame passion, reinforce a specific ideology, and rally support for a cause, which is the primary function of propaganda.
