Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "He is a part of the crazy, crazy, crazies." (Insulting label applied to Gillum and his group).
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – "That will never happen." (Repeated regarding Gillum's platform promises: corporate tax, teacher's pay, Medicare for all).
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "modern day fairy tales start with 'once I am elected.'" (A brief, memorable phrase used to discredit Gillum's promises).
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "Secret Gun Control Agenda Revealed"... "small steps" to ban assault rifles; "I don’t think he can say it [be]cause he’s trying to get the moderates" (Instills fear that Gillum has a hidden, radical gun control agenda he will implement if elected).
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "Gillum Makes Promises He Can’t Keep", "Empty Promises Exposed", "Deceiving Voters", "revealing his election strategy includes making empty promises", "a candidate lying to the voters" (Repeatedly questions Gillum's credibility, honesty, and ability to deliver on promises).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – "crazy, crazy, crazies" (Exaggerates Gillum's political alignment); "Florida is a “F***ed up,” “cracker state”" (Exaggerated, inflammatory characterization).
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national/group identity as a primary reason to support/oppose.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "Empty Promises Exposed", "Deceiving Voters", "fairy tales", "whip them up into a frenzy", "F***ed up", "cracker state", "white guilt", "crazy, crazy, crazies", "socialist", "way out of left field" (Uses emotionally charged, negative, and stereotypical language throughout).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No attempt to disapprove an idea by associating it with a hated group like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – No appeal to the popularity of an idea to convince the audience; the focus is on deception and hidden agendas.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – "The reason being, the legislature that write the bills is all Republican controlled. Democratic governor, Republican legislature. So, unless the legislature writes a bill, and it got voted on the floor, it cannot pass." (Oversimplifies the complex process of governance and policy implementation by solely blaming Republican control, ignoring negotiation, public pressure, bipartisan efforts, etc.).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is direct and accusatory, not deliberately unclear or obscure. Its claims are presented forcefully.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – "Said James O’Keefe, founder and president of Project Veritas Action: 'What we found in the Gillum campaign was just what we found in Missouri, Tennessee and Arizona, a candidate lying to the voters...'" (Uses O'Keefe's position and Project Veritas's actions as evidence for the claim of lying).
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – "Deceiving Voters: 'None of the programs that people are hoping for would happen' but 'That’s not for [voters] to know.'" (Presents Gillum's strategy as purely deceptive hiding of truth, implying no valid reason for campaign messaging strategy). Also implied throughout: Gillum is deceitful vs. honest.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "modern day fairy tales start with 'once I am elected.'" (A phrase used to dismiss Gillum's promises as inherently false without further discussion). Also: "crazy, crazy, crazies", "socialist" (used to shut down consideration of Gillum's policies).
16. **Red herring – No** – The text stays focused on attacking Gillum's campaign based on the undercover video. It doesn't introduce obviously irrelevant material.
17. **Straw men – No** – The text attacks statements and strategies attributed to Gillum's campaign staff via the video. It doesn't refute an argument Gillum didn't make.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The text does not charge Gillum or his campaign with hypocrisy by pointing to actions of others.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. Its primary purpose is to discredit Andrew Gillum and his campaign using selectively edited undercover video footage presented by Project Veritas Action. It employs numerous propaganda techniques effectively:
*   It heavily relies on **Name Calling**, **Loaded Language**, and **Doubt** ("crazy, crazy, crazies", "Deceiving Voters", "lying", "fairy tales", "F***ed up", "cracker state") to create a highly negative emotional response.
*   It uses **Repetition** ("That will never happen") and **Slogans** ("fairy tales...") to hammer home its message.
*   It employs **Appeal to Fear** regarding gun control and hidden agendas.
*   It uses **Appeal to Authority** (James O'Keefe, Project Veritas) to lend credibility.
*   It engages in **Causal Oversimplification** regarding governance and **Exaggeration/Minimization** in its characterizations.
*   It presents a **Black & White Fallacy** (deceit vs. honesty) and uses **Thought-Terminating Cliches** to shut down critical analysis of Gillum's actual platform.
The entire structure – the sensationalist headline, the bullet points summarizing damning (and often out-of-context) quotes, the selective presentation of staffer comments framed as "revealing secrets and lies," and the clear agenda of Project Veritas – confirms its nature as a piece designed not for balanced reporting, but to promote a specific negative narrative and influence voters against Gillum. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the *potential* existence of truth within the staffer's comments, but the presentation is undeniably propagandistic.
