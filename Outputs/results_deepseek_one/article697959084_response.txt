### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:  

1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation*: No insulting labels are used against targets (e.g., authorities are criticized but not labeled with terms like "traitors" or "liars").  

2. **Repetition** – No  
   *Explanation*: Key phrases like "multiple shooters" or "cover-up" appear but are not repeated obsessively; they serve narrative emphasis.  

3. **Slogans** – No  
   *Explanation*: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Build the Wall") are used. The text relies on descriptive language.  

4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
   *Explanation*: While the shooting is inherently frightening, the text does not exploit fear to promote an alternative agenda. It reports events without explicit fear-mongering.  

5. **Doubt** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation*: Explicitly questions official accounts: *"authorities have so far done everything in their power to cover-up"* and *"authorities have lied to the American people"*.  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation*: Exaggerates with *"completely destroyed"* (re: the official narrative) and minimizes investigative complexity by implying a deliberate, all-encompassing cover-up.  

7. **Flag-waving** – No  
   *Explanation*: No appeals to patriotism (e.g., "for America’s sake"). Criticisms focus on authorities, not national identity.  

8. **Loaded language** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation*: Emotionally charged terms like *"cover-up"*, *"hidden"*, *"astonishing"*, *"strikingly obvious"*, and *"destroyed"* evoke bias.  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *Explanation*: No comparisons to Nazis/hated groups.  

10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Appeals to consensus: *"Slowly but surely we are starting to see..."* and citing corroborating witnesses/police audio to validate the claim.  

11. **Causal oversimplification** – No  
    *Explanation*: No oversimplified cause-effect claims (e.g., "cover-up is the sole reason for confusion").  

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No  
    *Explanation*: Details are specific (times, locations, witnesses). No deliberate confusion.  

13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Uses eyewitnesses ("Jeff", "Rene Downs") and Shepard Ambellas’s validation of police audio as authoritative proof.  

14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Presents a binary: *either* authorities are lying *or* the eyewitnesses are truthful. No middle ground acknowledged.  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No  
    *Explanation*: No phrases like "case closed" or "obviously" used to stifle debate; questions remain open.  

16. **Red herring** – No  
    *Explanation*: No irrelevant distractions; stays focused on the Bellagio incident.  

17. **Straw men** – No  
    *Explanation*: The official "lone gunman" narrative is directly challenged, not misrepresented.  

18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    *Explanation*: No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., "What about other cover-ups?").

### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation  
**Yes, this text is highly likely to be propaganda**. It employs multiple techniques—**doubt**, **exaggeration**, **loaded language**, **bandwagon**, **appeal to authority**, and **black-and-white fallacy**—to advance a counternarrative challenging the official account of the Las Vegas shooting. The core goal is to discredit authorities by framing their actions as a deliberate "cover-up," using emotionally charged language (*"lied," "hidden," "destroyed"*) and selective evidence (eyewitness testimonials, partial police audio) while ignoring alternative explanations (e.g., chaos during mass shootings leading to misinformation). The text implies a conspiracy without proof, manipulates emotion through urgency (*"slowly but surely we are starting to see..."*), and dismisses complexity. While based on real testimony, its presentation is designed to provoke distrust, not foster balanced discussion. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges that eyewitness accounts *could* hold truth, but the framing aligns with propagandistic intent.
