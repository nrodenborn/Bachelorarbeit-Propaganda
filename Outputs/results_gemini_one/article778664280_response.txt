Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – No – The text uses loaded language and rhetorical questions that introduce labels (e.g., "homophobe"), but it does not directly attack a subject with an insulting label in the manner of the example "Public Enemy Number 1".
2.  Repetition – Yes – The core message that the Church has a "constant and unchanging moral teaching" against homosexual acts is repeated throughout the Remnant Comment, reinforced by quoting different authorities (the Catechism, Pope John Paul II) to hammer home the same point.
3.  Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable, and repeated phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – "according to the Church's own infallible teaching, everlasting damnation is the price to be paid for this kind of inclusivity and toleration." This statement directly threatens the audience with eternal punishment to discourage an alternative viewpoint.
5.  Doubt – Yes – "Who are these bishops that think they can play fast and loose not only with the moral theology of the Catholic Church, but also with the immortal souls of their flock?" This rhetorical question is designed to make the reader question the competence, motives, and faithfulness of certain bishops.
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – "McCarrick will become the norm, not the exception, and confidence in the leadership and moral authority of the Catholic Church will remain in the toilet indefinitely". This is an exaggeration that presents a potential worst-case scenario as a definite outcome.
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific Catholic identity by framing the issue as a battle between the "faithful" who believe in the "Church's constant and unchanging moral teaching" and bishops who are supposedly betraying that teaching for "political correctness." This creates a sense of in-group (traditional Catholics) versus an out-group (modernist bishops).
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – "this horrific scandal," "hideous violation of everything these bishops supposedly believe," "gross dereliction of duty," "forces of darkness." These phrases are chosen to evoke a strong emotional response rather than to be neutral descriptors.
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text argues against a perceived popular trend ("the spirit of our 'most enlightened' age"), positioning its viewpoint as a courageous stance against the masses rather than an appeal to join them.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – "Until the Church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis and the massive problem of homosexuality in the clergy." This statement reduces the multifaceted sexual abuse crisis to a single cause and a single solution.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The Remnant Comment is direct and explicit in its accusations and demands. It does not use vague or confusing language to hide its meaning.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – "Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that 'homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.' (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357)". The argument relies heavily on quoting authoritative Church documents and a pope to support its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – "Does he believe that all Catholics must follow the rules of the Church pertaining to the Sixth Commandment...or just the straight Catholics?" This question presents only two extreme options and ignores any middle ground or nuance in pastoral application.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – "It is not." This short, definitive statement is placed immediately after a quote about providing "pastoral attention" to homosexual persons, serving to shut down any further interpretation or discussion about what that pastoral care might entail.
16. Red herring – Yes – The Archbishop's statement is about his specific knowledge regarding the McCarrick scandal. The "REMNANT COMMENT" uses this as a jumping-off point to introduce a different argument: that the entire abuse crisis is rooted in the Church's perceived tolerance of homosexuality. This shifts the focus from the accountability of specific leaders to a broader ideological debate.
17. Straw men – Yes – "Notice the late pope does not say, “Let the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home among your faithful,” as Father James Martin and his episcopal fans are at least implying on a regular basis in the media." This misrepresents the opposing argument as a simplistic, easy-to-refute position that the opponent has not actually stated.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy on an unrelated matter. It maintains a direct attack on its chosen subject.

***

Verdict – 90% – The text as a whole is highly propagandistic. While the first section, Archbishop Hebda's statement, is a relatively straightforward personal account, the second and more aggressive section, the "REMNANT COMMENT," is a clear example of propaganda. It systematically uses a wide array of the techniques listed—including appeal to fear, loaded language, causal oversimplification, red herrings, and straw men—to advance a specific ideological agenda. The comment section hijacks the initial topic of the McCarrick scandal to argue that the root of the Church's problems is a perceived softening on its teaching regarding homosexuality. The purpose is not to foster understanding but to persuade the reader through emotional manipulation, logical fallacies, and by framing the issue as an urgent battle between good and evil, with the eternal souls of the faithful at stake. The sheer number and blatant application of these techniques in the Remnant Comment overwhelmingly define the propagandistic nature of the overall text.
