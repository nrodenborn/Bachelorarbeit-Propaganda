**Final Verdict**

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs a wide range of propaganda techniques, including repetition, appeal to fear, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, bandwagon, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. The purpose of the text is to motivate a specific political action (voting for pro-gun candidates) by appealing to emotion, identity, and fear, while presenting the issue in stark, oversimplified terms. The repeated poll question, emotionally charged language, and framing of the stakes as existential further reinforce its propagandistic nature. While it does not use every technique on the list, the concentration and variety of propaganda methods used make it overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda.
