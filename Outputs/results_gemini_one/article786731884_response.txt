1. Name calling – Yes – Explanation: The text labels Facebook’s leadership as "Unholy Alliance masters" and describes their actions as "Stalinist." It also refers to the subject of Glazov's book as the "Jihadist Psychopath."
2. Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The title of the book, "Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us," is mentioned multiple times, reinforcing the central theme. The phrase "community standards" is also repeated, often sarcastically, to highlight the perceived absurdity of Facebook's actions.
3. Slogans – No – Explanation: While there are memorable phrases like the book title, the text does not employ short, catchy slogans in the typical sense to rally support.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation: The text stokes fear by mentioning "skyrocketing jihadist stabbings in Europe," the threat of "another 9/11," and describing a "Jihadist Psychopath" who is "devouring us."
5. Doubt – Yes – Explanation: The text casts doubt on the legitimacy and motives of Facebook's content moderation, stating, "Somewhere in the “community standards” that Facebook demands everyone follow is a real doozy."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: The text uses exaggeration by describing the situation in "the creepiest and most harrowing Stalinist sense" and calling Facebook a "totalitarian plantation" engaging in "totalitarian suffocation of free thought."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation: The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as one of defending "American lives from jihad" and preventing attacks on "America." It also mentions Shariah's supposed "assault on the U.S. Constitution."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as "totalitarian plantation," "enslaved," "tyrannical," "Unholy Alliance," "suffocation," and "Shariah barbarities."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – Explanation: The text disapproves of Facebook's actions by comparing them to a hated regime, describing the situation as being in the "most harrowing Stalinist sense."
10. Bandwagon – Yes – Explanation: The text suggests a course of action is desirable because a notable person is already doing it: "Bill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives’ eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect... American comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher’s footsteps."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: The text simplifies the complex issue of content moderation by asserting that Facebook banned the article simply because its leaders are in an "Unholy Alliance" and "are clearly on the side of the Shariah enforcers."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanation: The text is not vague; it is direct and explicit in its accusations against Facebook.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation: The text presents Jamie Glazov as an authority ("author and commentator," "editor") and cites publications like Breitbart and FrontPage Magazine to lend credibility to its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation: The text presents a false dichotomy where one is either for Glazov's free expression to "stop jihadist attacks" or on the side of Facebook, who are portrayed as siding with "Shariah enforcers and oppressors of Muslim women and girls."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – Explanation: The text does not use clichés to shut down debate; instead, it uses inflammatory language to provoke a one-sided argument.
16. Red herring – Yes – Explanation: The text introduces a red herring by suggesting the ban might be due to Glazov's unrelated work: "No doubt, Glazov’s consistent campaigning on behalf of Muslim women and girls... has gained him the anger and hatred of Facebook’s guardians." This distracts from the specific content of the banned post and reframes the conflict.
17. Straw men – Yes – Explanation: The text refutes an argument that Facebook never made, stating, "it appears 'that daring to give suggestions on how our civilization can stop jihadist attacks and another 9/11 is against Facebook’s ‘community standards.'" This misrepresents Facebook's position as being against stopping terrorism, rather than being against the specific language used in the post.
18. Whataboutism – No – Explanation: The text focuses its criticism directly on Facebook and Twitter without deflecting by pointing out hypocrisy or unrelated wrongdoings of other parties.

***

Verdict – 100% – This text is a clear example of propaganda. It does not present a balanced or factual news report but rather a one-sided persuasive argument designed to provoke an emotional response and shape the reader's opinion. The piece systematically employs a vast array of propaganda techniques, including name-calling ("Stalinist," "Unholy Alliance masters"), appeal to fear (threats of "another 9/11"), loaded language ("totalitarian suffocation," "Shariah barbarities"), and flag-waving (defending "American lives"). It creates a simplistic black-and-white narrative, pitting a heroic free-speech advocate against a tyrannical, pro-jihadist social media giant. By using straw man arguments and causal oversimplification, it misrepresents the opponent's position and motives, avoiding any nuanced discussion of the complexities of content moderation. The primary goal is not to inform, but to indoctrinate the reader into a specific viewpoint.
