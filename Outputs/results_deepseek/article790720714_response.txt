Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "radical political activist who promotes baby murder" (insulting labels directed at Ford).
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No distinct, memorable phrase promoting the core message is used.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "promotes baby murder and other unlawful actions" instills fear about Ford's actions/ideology.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "Ford didn't even think to act... until Kavanaugh was on the short list", "She knew it would be made public", "She is seeking to slander a man's character" (all cast doubt on Ford's motives and credibility).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "promotes baby murder", "radical political activist", "mental issues". Minimization: "without any evidence at all", "absolutely no evidence" (minimizing Ford's testimony/claims).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "political hit", "ruining his good name", "radical political activist", "promotes baby murder", "unlawful actions", "out orchestrated", "slander", "destroy Brett Kavanaugh" (emotionally charged, negative terms).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association with universally hated groups used to discredit Ford/Kavanaugh opponents.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No explicit appeal to the popularity of the idea that Ford was part of a hit.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributing Ford's actions solely to being part of a premeditated political hit ("Of course, she was part of it!", "Ford was a part of it"), ignoring complex personal or contextual factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The author's claims are direct and inflammatory, not vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While Kavanaugh's denials and character references are mentioned, the author doesn't primarily rely on an authority figure to support *their own* central claim (that Ford was part of a hit).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – "Ford is not seeking justice nor is she seeking to do her 'civic duty.' She is seeking to slander..." (Presents only two extreme, negative motivations, ignoring other possibilities).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" or "just common sense" used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introducing the unrelated poll about Nikki Haley's replacement distracts from the main topic.
17. **Straw men** – No – The author attacks Ford's motives and credibility directly based on her actions (as presented by the author), not a misrepresented version of her argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – "Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of which has openly professed to sexual assault" (Charges opponents with hypocrisy/criminality to deflect from Ford/Kavanaugh).

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is not balanced analysis but to aggressively discredit Christine Blasey Ford and frame her accusation as a deliberate, malicious political attack ("hit") orchestrated by Democrats. This is achieved through repeated **Name Calling** ("radical," "baby murder," "mental issues"), **Loaded Language** throughout, creating **Doubt** about her motives and actions, **Exaggeration/Minimization** of her claims and character, **Causal Oversimplification** (reducing events solely to a political hit), **Black & White Fallacy** regarding her motivations, a **Red Herring** (the poll), and **Whataboutism**. The tone is highly emotional and accusatory, relying on inflammatory rhetoric rather than objective evidence-based argument to persuade the reader that Ford was a knowing participant in a conspiracy. The sheer volume and nature of these techniques overwhelmingly indicate propaganda.
