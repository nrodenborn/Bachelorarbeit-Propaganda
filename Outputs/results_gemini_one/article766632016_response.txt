Name calling – Yes – The author directly attacks the cleric by stating, "When he says that Muslims never killed Jews just for being Jews, he is lying".

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses the title of the author's book as a call to action, which functions as a slogan in this context: "Preorder The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS."

Appeal to fear – Yes – The author lists historical massacres in graphic terms to instill fear, such as, "they began massacring Jews, and initiated a wholesale slaughter of Jews in Granada."

Doubt – Yes – The cleric attempts to cast doubt on the historical record of the Holocaust with his bakery analogy: "How many ovens would you need to burn six million human beings?”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The cleric minimizes the Holocaust by claiming "the figure of six million is a historical lie."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The cleric appeals to a collective Muslim identity by stating, "There were Jews in the Islamic countries and caliphates as well, but we never killed them just for being Jews." The "we" refers to a shared group identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The cleric uses the emotionally charged and dismissive phrase "shed crocodile tears" to describe sympathy for Jewish people.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The cleric equates Zionism with Nazism by stating, "When we say ‘Final Solution,’ we realize that many of the terms used by the Zionist state constitute Nazi terms, ideas, and notions. It is as if they are two faces of the same coin."

Bandwagon – No – The text does not attempt to persuade the reader by suggesting an idea is popular or that "everyone" is doing it.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The cleric reduces the complex causes of the Holocaust to a single, simplistic reason: "The Jews were banished, tortured, and annihilated because of their deeds."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The cleric is intentionally vague when he says Hitler "knew the truth about the Jews" and that they were persecuted for "their deeds," without specifying what this "truth" or these "deeds" were.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites a historical figure to lend credibility to his argument: "The twelfth-century Muslim historian Ibn Baydhaq detailed how the Almohads treated the Jews..."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The cleric presents a false choice by claiming Jews were persecuted "because of their deeds. They were not banished for being Jews," creating a false dichotomy that ignores how their identity was used as the basis for fabricating justifications for persecution.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author's immediate declaration that the cleric "is lying" serves to shut down any consideration of the cleric's argument before it is fully presented.

Red herring – Yes – The poll, "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?", is completely irrelevant to the article's topic of historical relations between Muslims and Jews and serves as a distraction.

Straw men – Yes – The cleric refutes the idea that the Holocaust targeted "the Jews alone" to downplay the specific genocide against them. While other groups were targeted, he presents an oversimplified version of the historical understanding in order to attack it.

Whataboutism – Yes – When discussing the Holocaust, the cleric deflects by bringing up an unrelated atrocity: "When the Americans occupied the republics of the Indians, they annihilated millions of human beings."

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. It is a layered composition where one piece of propaganda (the cleric's speech) is used as a basis for another, separate piece of propaganda (the author's article).

First, the quoted cleric, Jihad Al-‘Ayesh, employs numerous propaganda techniques to promote a narrative of Holocaust denial and antisemitism. He uses minimization ("historical lie"), causal oversimplification ("because of their deeds"), whataboutism (mentioning Native Americans), and reduction ad Hitlerum (equating Zionism with Nazism) to attack the historical record and justify persecution.

Second, the author, Robert Spencer, frames the cleric's words within his own propaganda narrative. He uses name-calling ("lying"), appeal to fear (detailing massacres), and appeal to authority (citing his own book and a historian) to discredit the cleric and promote his own view on the history of Islam.

Finally, the structure of the article itself is propagandistic. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant and politically charged red herring (the poll about Democrat politicians) and the repetitive self-promotion ("Preorder The History of Jihad...") reveals that the article's purpose is not to inform neutrally, but to persuade, incite emotion, and reinforce a specific worldview in its target audience. Every element of the text serves a persuasive, rather than an objective, function.
