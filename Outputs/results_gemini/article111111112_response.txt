Verdict – 25% – The text is a news report, and its primary function is to inform the public by presenting facts and quoting the different parties involved in the event. In this respect, it is not overt propaganda. However, the text is not perfectly neutral. It contains a very high density of propaganda techniques used by the people it quotes. Furthermore, the article's own framing choices, such as labelling the bloggers' group "anti-Muslim" and the EDL "far-right" in its own narrative voice, and giving structural prominence to the official government position, subtly steer the reader towards viewing the ban as the correct and necessary course of action. While it reports on propaganda more than it creates it, these editorial choices give the text a mild propagandistic quality.
