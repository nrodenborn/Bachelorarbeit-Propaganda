Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "substitute of our Lord" (accusing Francis of usurping Christ's role), "the great accuser, Satan" (comparing Viganò's critics to the devil), "homosexual 'friends'" (pejorative labeling of advisors).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on Francis' silence ("I will not say a word!", "deafness to the appeals", "refuse to answer"), cover-up accusations, and Viganò's isolation ("standing alone").  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Scio cui credidi" (Latin motto used as a rallying cry), "voice crying in the wilderness" (biblical allusion framing Viganò as a prophet).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "forces of hell itself," "enemy... at the gates," "very survival of the human element of the Catholic Church," "anxiety for that martyr Church" (implies existential threat).  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "How can one avoid concluding...?" (questions transparency), "did the pope refuse...?" (challenges accountability), "cannot be trusted" (undermines credibility of leaders).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – *Exaggeration*: "most dangerous pontificate in history," "forces of hell," "thousands of innocent victims destroyed." *Minimization*: Downplays complexity of Vatican governance.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "Holy Mother Church," "spouse of Christ," "for the good of the Church," "battle against the old dragon" (appeals to Catholic identity/duty).  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Bombshell," "corrupt men," "perverse and evil," "grave harm," "subtle slander," "survival" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "We here at The Remnant not only stand with Viganò," "We are with you!" (implied call to join the cause).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames Church crises solely on Francis/McCarrick ("center of my testimony... the pope knew") while ignoring systemic factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Accusations are specific (e.g., McCarrick case, Inzoli reinstatement).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Invokes Scripture (Psalms, 2 Timothy), Catechism (par. 2491), and saints ("modern-day Athanasius") to legitimize claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents Viganò (truthful/courageous) vs. Francis (corrupt/silent) dichotomy; "forces of hell" vs. "Mary".  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "ring of truth," "clear conscience before God," "voice crying in the wilderness" (ends discussion via religious tropes).  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Focus remains on abuse cover-up allegations.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Criticizes actual positions (e.g., Francis' silence).  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Does not deflect to unrelated hypocrisy.

---

**Verdict – 85%** – The text exhibits extensive use of propaganda techniques. It employs *Name Calling*, *Appeal to Fear*, and *Loaded Language* to demonize Pope Francis ("substitute of our Lord," "forces of hell") while sanctifying Viganò ("courageous," "Athanasius"). *Repetition* and *Doubt* amplify accusations of cover-ups, while *Black & White Fallacy* simplifies the conflict as good vs. evil. *Appeal to Authority* (Scripture/Catechism) and *Flag-Waving* ("Holy Mother Church") manipulate religious sentiment, and *Thought-Terminating Clichés* ("ring of truth") discourage scrutiny. Though it cites specific incidents (Grassi, Inzoli), these serve *Causal Oversimplification*, blaming Francis for systemic issues. The absence of *Red Herring* or *Obfuscation* prevents a higher score, but the overwhelming emotional manipulation and partisan framing mark this as propaganda.
