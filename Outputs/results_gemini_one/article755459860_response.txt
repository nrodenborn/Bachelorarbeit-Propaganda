1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels for groups and ideas, for example, when describing the US government as engaging in "warmongering" and when quoting a source that calls Iran the "world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism."
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the exact same poll question three times in a row: "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?"
3. Slogans – Yes – The text quotes a brief, memorable, and aggressive phrase from John Bolton: “And that’s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!”
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text quotes a plan that instills fear of an alternative: “Absent a change in government within Iran, America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and motives of a key official: "I am not so naive as to consider that his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations has no effect in this decision."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes a potential threat to support its argument: "Iran is not an actual threat to the united States."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to American patriotism and foundational principles to argue against intervention: "Where is that authorized in our Constitution? Simple. It isn't."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses words that appeal to emotion and stereotypes to describe Islam: "I despise Islam and I despise the ideology of Muhammad and his devout followers."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text criticizes various groups and ideas but does not compare any of them to Nazis or similarly hated groups to discredit them.
10. Bandwagon – No – The author argues against a policy that is gaining traction within the White House and does not use an appeal to popularity to support their own argument.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text assumes a single, simple cause for a complex issue: "Well, why is that? It's due to sanctions imposed by the likes of the US."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's opinions and arguments are stated directly and bluntly, not in a deliberately unclear or obscure manner.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text appeals to a religious authority to validate the idea of fighting for freedom: "...let the passion that burns inside men to be free rise up as it did in our forefathers due to the teachings fo the Holy Scriptures and stand and fight."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a limited, two-step path as the only legitimate way for Iranians to gain freedom and support: "I say if the Iranian people want their freedom, let them first free themselves from the bondage of Islam, and then let the passion... rise up... Then, they will be in a position to ask for aid, but only then."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a common phrase to discourage further discussion on a complex topic: "...but that is something for the people there to deal with."
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces completely irrelevant material to distract the reader from the topic of Iran policy: "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?"
17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an argument that was not presented in the text in order to defend his position: "...yes, I know, I'll be called a liberal but honest readers who have followed me for some time know that's not the case."
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges the US with hypocrisy to deflect from the issue at hand: "...the US seems hell-bent on continuing to put its nose into other countries politics... while hypocritically pointing at other countries for trying to manipulate our own political system."

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a neutral analysis of foreign policy but an opinion piece that systematically employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to persuade the reader. The author uses highly emotional and loaded language, particularly regarding Islam, to frame the debate. The piece relies heavily on logical fallacies such as whataboutism, causal oversimplification, and straw men to attack its opponents and defend its position. Furthermore, it uses techniques of distraction, most notably the blatant red herring of a poll about Democratic politicians, which has no relevance to the topic of Iran. The combination of appeals to fear, flag-waving, repetition, and name-calling demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and biases rather than engage in a reasoned, factual discussion. The sheer number and variety of techniques used confirm the text's primary purpose as propaganda.
