Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

**Propaganda Technique Analysis:**
1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "leftist totalitarians," "fascistic manner," "leftist brownshirt-style assault," "Stalinist Left," "disgusting and venomous level," "fascist Left," "SPLC hate machine," "smear," "vicious lie".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on Facebook/Left's "totalitarian" nature, attacks on "free speech," "conservative voices," and the idea that the ban was lifted only due to publicity.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – While phrases like "free speech," "battle for America," and "war on America" are used, they are not presented as distinct, brief, memorable *slogans* within the text itself.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "clearly accelerating its totalitarian attack on the free speech of conservatives," "suffocate dissent and conservative voices," "war on America and on everything on which it stands," "dire moment," "battle for America -- and for the West".
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "We have no doubt, of course, that no 'mistake' had actually occurred...", "The question remains: why would Facebook remove such a page...", casting doubt on Facebook's explanation and motives.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – **Exaggeration:** "totalitarian attack," "unrelenting effort to suffocate dissent," "Stalinist Left's war on America," "brownshirt-style assault". **Minimization:** Downplaying Facebook's apology/reversal as merely a "retraction and surrender" only due to publicity and a "brief reprieve".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to American identity and values: "protecting America and the West," "defend... our liberties," "battle for America -- and for the West," "everything on which [America] stands".
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Pervasive use of emotionally charged and biased language: "tyrannical behavior," "Unholy Alliance masters," "insane variety," "fascistic manner," "hateful conduct," "venomous level," "pernicious assault," "truth-tellers," "brave conservative figures," "smear," "vicious lie".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – While using terms like "fascistic," "brownshirt," and "Stalinist" to evoke negative regimes, it doesn't explicitly link specific *ideas* to being popular with groups hated by the audience *based on that association alone* in the manner defined.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Listing supporters (Breitbart, PJMedia, WND, American Thinker, Malkin, Loomer, #WalkAway, PragerU, Diamond & Silk, Bosch Fawstin, etc.) to imply widespread conservative backing and legitimacy.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributing Facebook's reversal *solely* to "the wide publicity" and "massive support," ignoring other potential factors. Attributing all censorship to a coordinated "Leftist" or "totalitarian" agenda.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is highly specific in its accusations and examples, even providing citations (e.g., Quranic verses). It doesn't rely on deliberately unclear language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Citing "Leading scholar of Islam and JihadWatch.org Director Robert Spencer" and referencing "Leading brave conservative figures such as Michelle Malkin and Laura Loomer" to bolster the argument's credibility.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the conflict as purely "brave conservative truth-tellers" vs. "leftist totalitarians"/"fascist Left" engaged in a "war on America". Nuance is absent.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Phrases like "free speech victory," "leftist totalitarians," "Stalinist Left," "war on America," "Orwellian sense," "hate machine" are used to shut down critical analysis of the complex issues involved.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Introducing numerous other examples of alleged censorship (CJC page removal, Spencer's bans, PragerU, Alex Jones, David Horowitz Freedom Center, Washington Post article) distracts from the specific details and validity of *Jamie Glazov's* original ban and its reversal.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Refutes arguments not explicitly made by Facebook, e.g., the implication that Facebook thinks "giving advice on how to prevent another 9/11... is now against Facebook’s ‘community standards’" based solely on the ban of Glazov's specific article.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Defending Glazov by repeatedly pointing to other instances of perceived conservative censorship (Spencer, PragerU, Alex Jones, Diamond & Silk, CJC page, Brandon Straka, Horowitz Center) instead of solely addressing the specifics of his case. The Washington Post example about DeSantis/Horowitz is also used this way.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It employs a vast majority of the listed techniques (14 out of 18 definitively, with 1 borderline). Its primary purpose is not neutral reporting but to persuade the audience of a specific, highly charged narrative: that "leftist totalitarians" controlling social media (especially Facebook) and culture are engaged in a systematic, "Stalinist" "war" to "suffocate" conservative voices and free speech, constituting an existential "battle for America." This is achieved through relentless use of **Loaded Language**, **Name Calling**, **Appeal to Fear**, **Black & White Fallacy**, **Exaggeration**, and **Flag-Waving**. It **Simplifies Causality**, uses **Whataboutism** and **Red Herrings** to broaden the attack, employs **Thought-Terminating Clichés** to shut down dissent, and cites **Appeals to Authority** within its ideological sphere. The call to action (contacting representatives, amplifying voices, following Glazov) confirms its persuasive intent. While based on real events (Glazov's ban and reversal), the interpretation, framing, and language are deliberately manipulative and align perfectly with propaganda objectives. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the factual core of the ban/reversal event itself, though its presentation is propagandistic.
