Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, and appeal to authority. These elements suggest an attempt to sway the audience's perception of the FBI and LVMPD's handling of the Las Vegas massacre investigation. However, it also provides specific details and references, which add credibility to the claims. The presence of multiple propaganda techniques indicates a moderate likelihood of the text being propaganda, but the detailed nature of the content tempers this assessment.
