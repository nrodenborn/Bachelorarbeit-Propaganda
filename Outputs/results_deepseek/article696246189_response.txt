2. **Repetition** – No – No single message is repeated excessively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans in the core text (tweets use hashtags like #LasVagasShooting, but these are not authored by the article).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No attempt to instill fear against alternatives.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Tweets question media credibility: "WHY IS MEDIA NOT REPORTING THIS?" and "the govt. is hiding from us."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – No clear exaggeration/minimization in the article’s narrative (tweets use "hiding," but this is attributed).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "cover-up conspiracies," "Scumbag shooter," and "optimize his kill rate" evoke strong emotions/stereotypes.

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are specific (e.g., note contents described clearly).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Authorities are cited for facts (e.g., police revelations), not to oversell an argument.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomies presented.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to shut down critical discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introducing the "mystery woman" (identified as a prostitute) distracts from the note/motive investigation.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy.  

### Verdict  
**Verdict – 20% –** The text is primarily factual reporting, citing official sources (police, investigators) and documenting social media reactions. However, it includes propagandistic elements *from embedded tweets* (e.g., name-calling, sowing doubt about media/govt.) and uses loaded language (e.g., "cover-up conspiracies," "optimize his kill rate"). The "mystery woman" detail acts as a minor red herring. Overall, the core article avoids overt persuasion, but its framing amplifies external propaganda, resulting in a low likelihood of being propaganda itself.
