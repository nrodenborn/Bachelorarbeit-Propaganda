Name calling – Yes – The title of the article uses the label “Communist Door Boy” to attack the subject. The text also refers to the “dangerous and violent predilections of the left” and puts the word “man” in quotation marks when referring to the attacker.
Repetition – Yes – The question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is repeated three times in a row within the poll section.
Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief, memorable phrase to promote its own message.
Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests a frightening trend by stating “the dangerous and violent predilections of the left reared its ugly head once again” and asking “Is this the America Maxine Waters wanted? Where Trump supporters can't even have a meal in peace?”
Doubt – Yes – The text questions the distinction between confronting officials and attacking supporters with the rhetorical question: “how big of a leap would it be for a normal, rational adult to go from confronting administration officials to attacking the people who elected them to power?”
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline “Communist Door Boy” is an exaggeration, as the text later identifies the man as a member of the Green Party, not a communist. The incident is exaggerated to represent the behavior of the entire “left.”
Flag-Waving – Yes – The embedded tweet from “The Columbia Bugle” ends with an American flag emoji, appealing to patriotism.
Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “reared its ugly head,” “criminal attacker,” and placing the word “man” in quotation marks to create a negative emotional response.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.
Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest its ideas should be adopted because they are popular.
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the cause of the attack by directly blaming it on the rhetoric of Maxine Waters and the Democratic party: “The reality is that the Democrats are as much to blame for the corrosive and ugly rhetoric in America today as Donald Trump is.”
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its accusations and does not use deliberately unclear expressions.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The text quotes the attacker’s employer (Rumble) and a Green Party official to add credibility to the narrative, even while framing it with its own bias.
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh presents only two choices. The article also frames the political landscape as a simple conflict between violent “leftists” and peaceful “Trump supporters.”
Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common phrases or clichés to discourage critical thought.
Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll about Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation, which is completely irrelevant to the story about the assault, serving as a distraction.
Straw men – Yes – The text addresses the argument that Maxine Waters only called for confronting officials, then refutes a different, weaker argument by asking “how big of a leap would it be... to go from confronting administration officials to attacking the people who elected them?” This misrepresents the original distinction being made.
Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. While it reports on a real event, its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of a political group. This is evident from the very beginning with the highly biased and inflammatory headline ("Communist Door Boy"), which uses name-calling and exaggeration. The article consistently employs loaded language ("reared its ugly head") and appeals to fear to cast the incident as a sign of a dangerous trend among "the left." It uses causal oversimplification and a straw man argument to link the actions of one individual to the rhetoric of a congresswoman and the entire Democratic party. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Kavanaugh poll) further demonstrates that the article's goal is political persuasion and data collection rather than objective journalism. The combination of these techniques shows a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and opinions.
