### Verdict  
**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely propaganda. It uses multiple manipulative techniques:  
- **Fear-mongering** by linking Muslims to child abuse, terrorism, and corpses.  
- **Distortion** via exaggerated claims (e.g., "22 jihadi camps") and oversimplified blame on political correctness.  
- **Emotional manipulation** through loaded language ("brainwash," "jihadi camps") and irrelevant diversions (Obama, Kavanaugh poll).  
- **Partisan framing** that vilifies a religious group while deflecting accountability from current authorities.  
The article begins factually but devolves into ideologically driven rhetoric, aiming to provoke anti-Muslim sentiment and distrust in institutions. Only 15% neutrality is attributed to initial reporting of arrests/AP citations.
