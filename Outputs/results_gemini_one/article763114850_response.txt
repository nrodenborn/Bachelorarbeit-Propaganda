Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The title itself refers to the subject as the “Internet Thought Police,” an insulting label. The author also calls Ganesh’s work an “uninformed, biased and ideologically motivated attack” and his article “shoddy.”

Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – Yes – The text concludes with the phrase: “Who runs the Internet runs the world.”

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that “The people and political powers behind such initiatives are manipulating behavior online and literally controlling how people think and get information,” instilling fear of a loss of intellectual freedom and control.

Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the credibility and motives of Bharath Ganesh and his research, for example: “Is it simply a coincidence that Tommy Robinson is now in prison, and that a ‘researcher’ who presents such a misleading account of Robinson is currently actively engaged in consultation…?”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the flaws in the source article by stating it “is so riddled with non-sequiturs and wild generalizations that it seems almost cruel to rip it to shreds.” It also describes Tell MAMA as a “factory for the production of bogus claims about Islamophobia.”

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “Internet Thought Police,” “shoddy article,” “bogus claims,” and “Muslim rape gangs” to evoke strong emotional responses from the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest its ideas are correct because they are popular; in fact, it frames itself as a dissenting voice.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text implies a simple causal link between Ganesh’s research and Tommy Robinson’s imprisonment: “Is it simply a coincidence that Tommy Robinson is now in prison, and that a ‘researcher’ who presents such a misleading account of Robinson is currently actively engaged in consultation…?” This oversimplifies the legal and political reasons for Robinson’s situation.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its accusations and is not deliberately unclear or obscure.

Appeal to authority – No – The text attacks and questions authority (Oxford University, the EU) rather than using it as evidence for its own claims.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a binary struggle between the “Internet Thought Police” who are “controlling how people think” and those who are being unjustly silenced (like Tommy Robinson). It leaves no room for a middle ground or more complex interpretations.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; it actively tries to promote a specific line of thinking.

Red herring – Yes – The poll inserted in the middle of the text, asking “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?”, is completely irrelevant to the article’s topic of Bharath Ganesh and online extremism research. It serves only to distract the reader and push a different agenda.

Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an argument that Ganesh did not necessarily make. After quoting Ganesh’s point about the attacker finding a “narrative from British counter-jihad groups,” the author asks, “What ‘narrative… can one find which suggests driving vehicles into innocent Muslims…?” This reframes Ganesh’s argument about general influence into a more specific, easier-to-refute claim of direct incitement.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text accuses Ganesh of the same faults he supposedly finds in the groups he studies: “One could start from the observation that the article is certainly not an academic piece, and gives no concrete evidence for any of the sweeping claims it makes… (Oddly enough, this makes it rather like the groups it claims to criticize.)”

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or engage in a balanced critique, but to persuade the reader by discrediting a specific individual (Bharath Ganesh) and the institutions he is associated with (Oxford University, the EU, Tell MAMA). It achieves this by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques.

The article builds a conspiratorial narrative of a powerful, biased elite ("Internet Thought Police") working to silence dissenters under the guise of academic research. It relies heavily on emotional manipulation through loaded language ("shoddy," "bogus"), name-calling, and appeals to fear about thought control. Instead of presenting counter-evidence, it uses logical fallacies like doubt, straw men, and causal oversimplification to attack its target's credibility and motives, repeatedly using insinuating rhetorical questions like "Is it simply a coincidence...?" The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring poll further demonstrates that the article's intent is not journalistic integrity but audience manipulation and agenda-pushing. The sheer density and combination of these techniques confirm its nature as a piece of propaganda.
