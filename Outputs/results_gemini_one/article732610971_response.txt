1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to migrants as an “invasion of Muslims” and “Muslim invaders,” and to George Soros as a "public enemy" with a "mafia network."
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea of migration as a negative, threatening force is repeated using various phrases like “illegal immigration,” “invasion of Muslims,” “migrant invasion,” and “Europe being overrun.”
3. Slogans – Yes – The text mentions Orban's “‘Stop Soros’ law,” which is a brief and memorable phrase used to rally support for his policies against George Soros.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text quotes Orban saying that with mass immigration, “our worst nightmares can come true. The West falls as it fails to see Europe being overrun.”
5. Doubt – No – The text makes direct accusations rather than posing questions to undermine credibility.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the influence of George Soros by quoting Orban calling his organizations a "mafia network." The author also exaggerates by stating, "Christianity is not Europe's 'last hope,' it's the world's 'only hope.'"
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a shared Christian and European identity by quoting Orban: “Christianity is Europe’s last hope,” and describing him as a “savior of Europe’s Christian nations.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like “invasion,” “invaders,” “traitors,” and “nightmares” to describe migration and political opponents.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – While the text reports that George Soros compared Orban to the Nazis, the author of the text itself does not use this technique to discredit an idea.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text quotes Orban listing other groups and countries that are joining his cause: “The V4 is firm, Croatia has come around, Austria has turned in the patriotic direction, and in Bavaria the CSU has created a resistance.”
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex issue of migration by attributing the "danger" Europe faces directly to “politicians in Brussels, Berlin and Paris” and the influence of George Soros.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is generally direct and clear in its messaging and accusations, not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author appeals to religious authority to support their point, stating, "The fight isn't hopeless for those whose hope is in the Lord and will stay the course."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a binary choice between Orban’s vision for Europe and a destructive alternative, for instance, by contrasting his path with an “immigrant zone, a mixed population world that heads in a direction different from ours.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author’s interjection, "One thing to note is that Christianity is not Europe's 'last hope,' it's the world's 'only hope,'" is a dogmatic statement that discourages further discussion or critical thought on the matter.
16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central topic of Orban's anti-migration stance and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the audience.
17. Straw men – No – The text primarily presents its own arguments and attacks opponents directly rather than misrepresenting and then refuting an opponent's position.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism of Orban by accusing his opponents of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a neutral news report but a highly biased piece designed to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint. This is evident in several ways: the pervasive use of numerous propaganda techniques (11 out of 18 were identified); the interweaving of the author's own supportive and religious commentary with selective reporting; and the consistent framing of a complex political issue as a simple, existential battle between good (Orban, Christian Europe) and evil (migrants, George Soros, "traitors" in the West). The piece employs emotionally charged and dehumanizing language (Name Calling, Loaded Language) and creates a sense of crisis (Appeal to Fear) to manipulate the reader's emotions. It then offers a simple solution and a group to join (Causal Oversimplification, Bandwagon), which are classic hallmarks of propaganda. The primary goal is not to inform, but to rally support for a specific political and ideological cause.
