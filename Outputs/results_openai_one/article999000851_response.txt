Certainly! Here is the analysis for each propaganda technique, followed by the final verdict:

---

**1. Name calling – No –** There is no use of explicit insulting labels against an individual or group. The closest is calling Acosta’s actions “antics” and “misbehavior,” but these are not direct name-calling labels.

**2. Repetition – Yes –** The poll repeats the question “Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?” multiple times, reinforcing the issue and framing it as a matter of debate.

**3. Slogans – No –** There are no brief, memorable phrases used as slogans in the text.

**4. Appeal to fear – No –** The text does not instill fear about alternatives or outcomes; it is more focused on the consequences for Acosta and journalists.

**5. Doubt – Yes –** The text questions the legitimacy of Acosta’s actions (“argued with Trump instead of asking questions,” “physically prevented a White House intern from taking the microphone”), casting doubt on his professionalism.

**6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes –** Acosta’s actions are described as “antics,” “misbehavior,” and “physically prevented a White House intern,” which may exaggerate the severity of his conduct.

**7. Flag-Waving – No –** There is no direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.

**8. Loaded Language – Yes –** Terms like “antics,” “misbehavior,” and “argued with Trump instead of asking questions” are emotionally charged and designed to provoke a negative reaction toward Acosta.

**9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No –** There is no comparison to hated groups or suggestion of Nazi-like behavior.

**10. Bandwagon – No –** The text does not appeal to popularity or suggest that “everyone” supports a particular view.

**11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes –** The text implies that “thanks to Jim Acosta, all White House correspondents have to adhere to the new rules,” simplifying a complex situation to a single cause.

**12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No –** The text is relatively clear about the events and rules; there is no deliberate vagueness.

**13. Appeal to authority – Yes –** The text references official letters from Sanders and Shine, and a federal judge’s ruling, to support its narrative.

**14. Black & white fallacy – Yes –** The poll offers only binary choices (“Yes, he should have gotten it back. No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass.”), presenting the issue as having only two sides.

**15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes –** The poll option “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass” is a cliché that shuts down further discussion.

**16. Red herring – No –** The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main issue.

**17. Straw men – No –** The text does not misrepresent an opposing argument to refute it.

**18. Whataboutism – No –** The text does not charge an opponent with hypocrisy or deflect criticism by pointing to others.

### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 80% –**  
The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including repetition, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and thought-terminating clichés. The framing of Acosta’s actions, the repeated poll question, emotionally charged language, and the oversimplification of the situation all serve to influence the reader’s perception of the event and the individuals involved. While the text does present factual information, the use of these techniques suggests a strong intent to persuade or manipulate the audience’s opinion rather than to inform neutrally. Therefore, there is a high likelihood (80%) that the text is propaganda.
