**Verdict – 5% –**  
The text is overwhelmingly factual and neutral, reporting on legislative developments following a tragic school shooting. The only possible propaganda technique present is a mild "appeal to authority" when quoting Ryan Petty, a victim’s parent, and referencing official statements from politicians. However, these are standard journalistic practices for providing context and human interest, not manipulative propaganda. There is no evidence of loaded language, emotional manipulation, or attempts to sway the reader through fallacies or misleading techniques. Thus, the likelihood of this text being propaganda is extremely low—about 5%—primarily due to the minimal use of authority figures for context rather than persuasion.
