Verdict – 15% – The text itself is a piece of journalism, not a work of propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about a legal and social conflict in Mercer County. However, the article is filled with examples of propaganda techniques because it is reporting on the arguments and statements of the people involved in the conflict. The propaganda is not being used by the author to push a specific agenda, but rather is being quoted and described to illustrate the nature of the debate. For instance, the ‘Name Calling’ (“foundation of lies”), ‘Bandwagon’ (“widespread support”), and ‘Black & White Fallacy’ (“You are not a Christian”) are all statements made by the subjects of the article, not by the narrator. The author maintains a journalistic balance by presenting arguments from both sides of the issue, quoting legal experts, and providing factual context. The low percentage reflects that while the text is a container for propaganda used by others, the structure and intent of the article itself are informative rather than persuasive.
