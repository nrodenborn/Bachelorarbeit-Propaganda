Here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "former top spook" (referring to Pompeo), "Russians everywhere State Department shenanigans", "Clinton City..." (mocking Pompeo's views by associating them with Clinton).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The structure "If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, you’ll like Pompeo’s" and "Again, if you liked Obama-era... this is your guy" repeats the core message linking Pompeo to Clinton/Obama policies.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable, rallying phrases are used.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Highlighting Haspel's involvement in torture and destruction of evidence, and Pompeo's views on Russia, WikiLeaks, Syria, Iran, and North Korea, aims to instill fear about their appointments and the direction of US foreign policy ("world-on-fire").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Repeatedly questions Pompeo's judgment and credibility (e.g., linking him to Clinton/Obama, his views on Russia/WikiLeaks/Syria/Iran/NK) and Haspel's character/ethics (torture, destruction of evidence).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – **Exaggeration:** "world-on-fire", "Russians everywhere State Department shenanigans", "the worst abuses", "particularly gruesome torture". **Minimization:** "Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!" (dismissive tone compared to the detailed criticism of Pompeo/Haspel).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No direct appeal to patriotism or national identity as a reason for support.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "strained relationship", "big shake-up", "deep state", "lashed out", "shenanigans", "non-state hostile intelligence service", "abetted", "propaganda outlet", "torture regime", "worst abuses", "controversial interrogation program", "harsh techniques", "gruesome torture", "destruction", "concealment", "obstruction".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Hitler or universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Implies that supporting Pompeo/Haspel is equivalent to supporting unpopular figures/policies (Clinton, Obama-era policies) to discourage approval: "If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure... you’ll like Pompeo’s", "if you liked Obama-era... this is your guy".
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – While critical, the text doesn't attribute complex events to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and specific in its criticisms, not vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites the Washington Post, The Intercept, Greg Miller, the Senate Intelligence Committee report, and commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane to support claims about Haspel.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents Pompeo's views as being identical to Clinton/Obama's, implying no nuanced difference ("If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure... you’ll like Pompeo’s", "Like Clinton and her Democrat allies, Pompeo has long subscribed...").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Bottom line" is used to shut down discussion and assert the conclusion that Bush/Obama policies continue under Trump.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Criticisms, while harsh, are relevant to Pompeo's and Haspel's records and the article's argument about continuity with previous policies.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks positions Pompeo and Haspel actually hold or actions they were involved in (based on cited sources), not misrepresented ones.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text focuses on criticizing Pompeo and Haspel directly, not by charging the *opponent* with hypocrisy regarding other issues.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It exhibits a significant number of propaganda techniques (at least 10 out of 18 analyzed). Its primary purpose is not neutral reporting but to aggressively persuade the reader that Trump's appointments of Pompeo and Haspel represent a dangerous continuation of unpopular Clinton/Bush/Obama-era foreign policy doctrines. This is achieved through heavy use of **Loaded Language**, **Name Calling**, **Exaggeration**, **Appeal to Fear**, and **Doubt** to vilify the subjects. It employs **Bandwagon** and **Black & White Fallacy** to associate them negatively with previous administrations. **Repetition** reinforces the core message linking them to Clinton/Obama, and a **Thought-terminating cliché** ("Bottom line") shuts down the argument. While it uses citations (**Appeal to Authority**), these are selectively employed to support its highly critical narrative, and the overall tone and framing are overwhelmingly polemical rather than objective. The lack of any substantive counterpoints or attempts at balance further indicates a propagandistic intent to shape perception against these appointments and the administration's direction.
