Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to Haig, Paddock, or others. Descriptions like "gunman" or "person of interest" are factual.
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific message or phrase is repeated excessively throughout the text to drive it home.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to summarize a position or evoke an emotional response.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text reports on a tragic event but does not use fear of alternatives to support a specific idea or course of action.
5.  **Doubt** – No – While police suspicions about Haig are reported ("may have conspired"), the text does not explicitly cast doubt on his credibility or that of others as a technique; it presents both his denial and the police view neutrally.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The facts presented (e.g., number of rounds sold, casualties) appear reported without obvious inflation or downplaying. Haig's denial is presented directly.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity to garner support for a viewpoint.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is generally neutral and factual (e.g., "sold," "ammunition," "attack," "denies"). Terms like "massacre" and "gunman" are descriptive of the event, not emotionally charged *in this context* to manipulate.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There are no comparisons made to Hitler, Nazis, or universally hated groups to disapprove of an idea or person.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or action to encourage acceptance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text does not attribute the complex event (the shooting) to a single, simple cause. It reports Haig sold ammo and police suspicions, but doesn't state he caused it.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and direct. While the investigation's status is "unclear," this is reported as a fact, not used to deliberately confuse. Details like the type of ammo ("tracer ammunition") and Haig's statements are specific.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While authorities (police, FBI) are cited as sources of information, their statements are not used as definitive proof to support a specific claim beyond reporting their actions or findings. Haig's denial is also presented.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents multiple perspectives (police suspicion vs. Haig's denial) and complexities (unclear investigation status, unknown motive). It doesn't frame the situation as only two stark choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking or discussion. The text presents information and questions (like Haig's own "What did I miss?") without providing simplistic answers.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the topic of Haig's involvement, the ammo sale, and the investigation. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text accurately reports the positions: police suspect conspiracy, Haig denies involvement and supplying most ammo/firearms. It doesn't misrepresent or refute an argument nobody made.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Haig does not charge his accusers (police) with hypocrisy to deflect from the accusations against him. He simply denies the allegations and explains his actions.

**Verdict – 5% –** The text reads overwhelmingly as a standard, factual news report. Its primary purpose is to inform about developments in the investigation, specifically revealing Haig's identity and presenting his perspective alongside the known police suspicions. It presents multiple viewpoints (police, Haig, his lawyers) neutrally, reports verified details (ammo sale, warrant, lack of charges against Danley), and acknowledges uncertainties (unclear investigation status, unknown motive). The language is largely objective and descriptive. The very low percentage (5%) acknowledges the *potential* for subtle bias inherent in any reporting or the choice of focus, but the text itself lacks the hallmarks of propaganda techniques designed to manipulate opinion or promote a specific agenda. It informs rather than persuades.
