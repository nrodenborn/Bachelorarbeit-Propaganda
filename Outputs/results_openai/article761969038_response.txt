Verdict – 60% – The text shows several characteristics of propaganda, such as repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and black & white fallacy. These techniques suggest a significant likelihood that the text is intended to persuade the audience by emphasizing the negative impact of immigration on native-born workers, potentially at the expense of a balanced and nuanced discussion. However, the presence of detailed statistics and the absence of some other propaganda techniques reduce the likelihood of it being purely propaganda.
