Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text "Stop Appeasing the Democrats":

1. **Name calling** – Yes – Examples: "Creepy Lawyer" (referring to Stormy Daniels' attorney), "trendoid socialists" (describing Democrats), "knuckle-dragging Neanderthal sexists" (characterizing how #MeToo might portray Republicans).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated use of "appeasement/concessions" (e.g., "appeasing an aggressor," "no more concessions," "Republicans start negotiating and offering concessions"), "farce" (e.g., "end this farce," "farce of allowing unsubstantiated charges"), and "delay" (e.g., "delaying tactic," "no more delays").  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, standalone memorable phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL"). The closest ("Stop Appeasing the Democrats") is the article title but functions more as a thesis than a slogan.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings that appeasement leads to defeat (e.g., "appeasing an aggressor invites only more aggression"), Democrats retaking the Senate to block "Constitutionalist judges," and Republicans being "demonized" regardless of concessions.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions credibility of accusers (e.g., "Ford can’t remember where and when," "Ramirez’s charge is even flimsier," "no federal crime is being alleged") and the FBI investigation ("another delaying tactic").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes accusations (e.g., "flimsier," "patently incoherent," "preposterous conditions") and exaggerates Democratic tactics (e.g., "desperately attempting to obstruct," "naked ploy," "rabid partisans").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to patriotism via the Constitution (e.g., "judicial usurpation of Congress’s law-making powers," "our bedrock principle," "Constitutionalist judges").  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms: "bork Kavanaugh," "rabid partisans," "duplicitous feminist narrative," "serially escalating demands," "virtue-signaling," "beclown themselves."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Reduces Kavanaugh hearings to a Democratic conspiracy (e.g., "engineered by the Democrats," "reeks of premeditated contrivance"). Ignores broader context (e.g., genuine concerns about sexual assault).  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Arguments are direct, not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No cited authoritative sources (e.g., "experts say").  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents false dilemma: Appease Democrats or "shoot the alligator" (e.g., "no amount of appeasement will stop the left," "acting on principle").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" used to halt debate.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Irrelevant mentions: Keith Ellison (to accuse Democrats of hypocrisy), Mitt Romney’s "binders full of women" (to deflect from current accusations).  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents Democrats’ goals as wanting to "stop any more Constitutionalist judges" (oversimplifying opposition to Kavanaugh’s jurisprudence) and portrays "fundamentalist feminists" as believing "every accusation... must be believed" (ignoring nuance in #MeToo).  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Uses Keith Ellison to charge hypocrisy: "doesn’t Keith Ellison’s accuser deserve to be heard and believed too?"  

---

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 12 distinct propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy, Red Herring, Straw Men, Whataboutism) to advance a one-sided, emotionally charged narrative. Key indicators include:  
- **Dehumanizing language** ("Creepy Lawyer," "trendoid socialists") to discredit opponents.  
- **False dichotomies** framing the conflict as surrender vs. principled resistance.  
- **Systematic undermining** of accusations against Kavanaugh via minimization, doubt, and conspiracy framing ("engineered by the Democrats").  
- **Appeals to tribal identity** through constitutional patriotism and partisan loyalty.  
- **Emotional manipulation** via fear (Democrats "retaking the Senate") and anger ("preposterous conditions," "duplicitous narrative").  
While presented as political commentary, the text’s relentless use of manipulative techniques, lack of neutral evidence, and overt goal of galvanizing opposition ("Hold the vote... hold them to account") align it with propaganda. The 5% uncertainty reflects its embedding in a legitimate political debate (Supreme Court confirmations), but its execution is predominantly propagandistic.
