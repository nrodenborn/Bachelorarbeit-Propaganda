Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text labels Dina Powell as a “globalist,” part of the “swamp,” an “Islamic apologist,” and the “Republican Huma Abedin.”
2.  Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is repeated three times consecutively. Additionally, the text repeatedly mentions her connections to Huma Abedin and Valerie Jarrett and describes her as part of the “swamp” or “establishment.”
3.  Slogans – Yes – The text uses phrases like Trump's “America first” approach and the question, “How do you drain the swamp by adding to it?”
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests her appointment would be a continuation of the “failed approach of the Bush years” and links her to individuals and policies (like McMaster's view on Islam) that are framed as a threat to Trump's agenda and national security.
5.  Doubt – Yes – The entire piece is designed to cast doubt on Dina Powell's suitability for the role, questioning her alignment with Trump’s “America first” approach and her conservative credentials by highlighting her past associations.
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of her connections by listing them out and using loaded labels like “the Republican Huma Abedin.” It also frames her associations with groups like the Clinton Global Initiative in a highly negative and potentially inflated way.
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by contrasting Powell’s alleged “globalist” tendencies with Trump’s “‘America first’ approach to foreign policy” and by labeling the UN an “anti-American organization.”
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “sordid history” (referring to Goldman Sachs), “controversial Clinton Foundation,” “globalist,” and “swamp” to create a negative impression.
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text includes a poll, a common tool to create a sense of popular opinion and encourage readers to join in. It also mentions that she is “coming under criticism from some conservatives on social media,” suggesting a growing movement of opposition.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies complex foreign policy and personnel decisions, for example, by stating, “It’s not hard to see why McMaster pushed out McFarland and elevated Habib-Powell,” reducing the decision to a single, simplistic ideological conflict.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and its overall message. It is not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text relies heavily on quotes and reports from partisan sources like Breitbart, Daniel Greenfield, and Pamela Geller, presenting their opinions as authoritative evidence to support its claims against Powell.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a world of two choices: supporting Trump’s “America first” agenda or being a “globalist” part of the “swamp.” It frames Dina Powell as being firmly in the latter category, with no room for nuance.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The rhetorical question, “How do you drain the swamp by adding to it?” serves as a thought-terminating cliché, simplifying a complex issue into a well-known political slogan that discourages further analysis.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text repeatedly brings up her associations with the Clintons, Huma Abedin, and Valerie Jarrett. While presented as evidence of her being a “globalist,” this serves to distract from her actual qualifications or policy stances by focusing on personalities the target audience dislikes.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text constructs a caricature of Dina Powell as a “globalist” and part of the “swamp” who is fundamentally opposed to Trump’s agenda. It then attacks this constructed caricature rather than engaging with her actual record or specific policy proposals in detail.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses entirely on attacking Dina Powell and does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing others of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform the reader but to persuade them to adopt a negative view of Dina Habib Powell. While it includes some factual reporting (e.g., quotes from Bloomberg and Politico), this information is used as a springboard for a sustained attack built on a wide array of propaganda techniques.

The piece heavily employs name-calling (“globalist,” “swamp”), loaded language (“sordid history”), and appeals to emotion and identity (flag-waving). It constructs a narrative using a black & white fallacy, where Powell represents the "swamp" and the "failed" establishment, in direct opposition to the "America First" agenda. The argument relies on appeals to partisan authorities (Breitbart, Pamela Geller) and uses red herrings (extensive focus on the Clintons) and straw man arguments (attacking a caricature of Powell) to make its case. The sheer number of techniques used (15 out of the 18 listed) demonstrates a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than present a balanced or objective analysis of her potential candidacy.
