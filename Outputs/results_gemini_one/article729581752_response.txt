Name calling – No – The text does not use any insulting labels to attack a person, group, or object.

Repetition – No – The text does not repeat a specific message in a manipulative way; it explains a scientific concept which requires revisiting key terms for clarity.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to rally support or oversimplify a message.

Appeal to fear – No – The text actively works against this by stating in the headline "scientists aren’t worried" and later that the event "will have very little effect on the overall global warming trend".

Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or source; it presents the scientific findings as credible.

Exaggeration/minimization – No – While it mentions the grand minimum is an "exaggerated version of the typical solar minimum," this is used as a scientific description, not as a tool for manipulation. It also minimizes the effect on global warming based on the researchers' conclusions, not to deceptively downplay a threat.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make any appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – No – The language used is objective and scientific, not emotionally charged or stereotypical.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to hated groups like the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is correct because it is popular; it presents a scientific finding.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text avoids this by explaining the complexity of solar cycles and noting that forecasting specific effects "has proven difficult".

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is written clearly with the intent to inform the reader about a scientific phenomenon.

Appeal to authority – Yes – "The study, which was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, was carried out by a team led by physicist Dan Lubin of the University of California, San Diego."

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present a false dichotomy of only two choices.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases that discourage critical thought.

Red herring – No – The text stays focused on the central topic and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the reader.

Straw men – No – The text presents information and does not refute any unstated arguments.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge any opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 0% – The text is an informative news article reporting on a scientific study. Its primary purpose is to educate the public about a natural phenomenon, not to persuade them towards a specific ideology or action. It uses neutral language, cites credible sources appropriately (the "Appeal to authority" is a legitimate journalistic practice of sourcing, not a fallacious argument), and actively downplays potential for alarm. It lacks the manipulative intent and widespread use of propaganda techniques that would classify it as propaganda.
