Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – Explanation: The text uses insulting labels to describe Bill Clinton, such as being “more famous for his Don Juan-like seductions than for his policy legacy” and noting his “lothario habits.”
Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The idea that the scandal is old news is repeated by both Clinton ("This was litigated 20 years ago," "I dealt with it 20 years ago, plus") and his co-author James Patterson ("It's 20 years ago, come on!").
Slogans – No – Explanation: The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases used as slogans to promote an idea.
Appeal to fear – No – Explanation: The text does not attempt to instill fear in the audience about any particular outcome or alternative.
Doubt – Yes – Explanation: Clinton questions the credibility of the media's narrative by stating, "'A lot of the facts have been omitted to make the story work,'" and directly challenges the interviewer: "he accused interviewed Craig Melvin of 'ignor[ing] gaping facts'".
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: Clinton minimizes the need for a personal apology by implying his public apology "to everybody in the world" was sufficient. The article also exaggerates his reputation by calling him "more famous for his Don Juan-like seductions than for his policy legacy."
Flag-Waving – No – Explanation: The text does not use patriotic appeals or symbols to persuade the audience.
Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "Don Juan-like seductions," "lothario habits," "gross abuse of power," and "public humiliation" to influence the reader's perception.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation: The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or other universally hated groups.
Bandwagon – Yes – Explanation: Clinton appeals to popularity to justify his past actions by stating, "Two-thirds of the American people sided with me."
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: Clinton suggests the renewed interest in his scandal is simply because people are "frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office," which is an oversimplification of a complex cultural shift.
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – Explanation: Clinton's claim that he "apologized to everybody in the world" is a vague statement used to avoid answering the specific question about a personal apology to Lewinsky.
Appeal to authority – No – Explanation: The text cites various figures but does not use their authority as the sole evidence to prove a claim; rather, it reports their statements.
Black & white fallacy – No – Explanation: The text does not present a situation where only two choices are possible while ignoring other alternatives.
Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation: James Patterson's exclamation, "It's 20 years ago, come on! Stop already!" is used to shut down the line of questioning and discourage further discussion on the topic.
Red herring – Yes – Explanation: When questioned about his own actions, Clinton introduces irrelevant material to distract by bringing up "serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office."
Straw men – Yes – Explanation: The interviewer asks about a personal apology, but Clinton refutes a different, unstated argument by talking about the legal and political outcome ("This was litigated 20 years ago. Two-thirds of the American people sided with me.") instead of the personal, moral question.
Whataboutism – Yes – Explanation: Clinton and Patterson deflect criticism by charging the interviewer with hypocrisy, bringing up the affairs of other presidents: "Let's talk about JFK. Let's talk about, you know, LBJ. Stop already!" and "You think President Kennedy should have resigned?"

Verdict – 85% – This text is a news report about an interview, but it is heavily saturated with propaganda. The subjects of the article, Bill Clinton and James Patterson, use numerous techniques to deflect criticism, reframe the narrative, and avoid answering direct questions. These include Whataboutism (citing JFK/LBJ), Red Herring (mentioning the current president), Bandwagon ("Two-thirds of the American people sided with me"), and Doubt (questioning the media's facts). Furthermore, the article's author also employs propaganda, primarily through Name-calling ("Don Juan-like," "lothario") and Loaded Language ("flustered former president") to frame Clinton in a negative light. While its format is a news article, the combination of reporting on propaganda and using propagandistic language makes the text highly persuasive and manipulative rather than purely informative.
