---

**Verdict – 95%** – The text is highly likely propaganda. It employs multiple persuasive techniques (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, appeal to fear) to delegitimize Judge Saris and frame immigration policy in emotionally charged terms. Key indicators include:  
- **Dehumanizing language**: Repeated use of "Kritarch" and "treasonous" to vilify judges.  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded terms ("sabotage," "broken promise") and fear appeals (immigrants "disappear").  
- **Selective framing**: Cites legal authorities (Constitution, U.S. Code) while ignoring Saris’s habeas corpus argument.  
- **Bias**: Omits context for Saris’s rulings (e.g., due process concerns) and reduces complex issues to a "good vs. evil" narrative.  
The text’s goal is not balanced analysis but to provoke outrage against judicial figures and advance a specific ideological stance on immigration, aligning with propaganda’s core function of influencing perception through manipulation.
