Verdict – 10% – The text is a news report, not a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about President Trump's actions and concerns regarding the Mueller report, citing multiple sources and providing direct quotes. The propaganda techniques identified within the text (Name calling, Repetition, Doubt, Loaded Language) are not used by the author of the article to persuade the reader. Instead, the author is *reporting* that Donald Trump and his campaign are using these techniques. A news article that reports on the use of propaganda is fundamentally different from a text that is itself propaganda. The low percentage accounts for potential journalistic bias in word choice or the framing of the story, but the text's structure and intent are journalistic, not propagandistic.
