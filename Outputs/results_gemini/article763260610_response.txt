1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents with insulting terms, such as calling Adam Schiff the "leader of the Russia-gate frenzy" and his supporters "Russia-gate freaks." It also refers to the media as a "corrupt media."

2. Repetition – Yes – The central theme of a "silence" surrounding the Assange case is repeated multiple times. The title is "The Eerie Silence," Pilger's statement begins with "There is a silence," and he later says, "There is a kind of eerie silence around the Julian Assange case."

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate its message, such as "demand justice and free speech for Julian" and framing the issue around "our right to know."

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by describing the potential consequences for Assange if he leaves the embassy as being "arrested, extradited to the United States and ending up in a hell hole."

5. Doubt – Yes – The text consistently questions the credibility of official narratives and institutions. For example, it refers to "The fakery of Russia-gate" and states that Pulitzer-winning investigations "turned up not a shred of real evidence."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the positive aspects of Assange, calling him a "constitutional hero," while minimizing the Russia investigation as "ludicrous" and "nonsense."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to American constitutional principles to support its case, stating that freedom of speech is "enshrined in the United States Constitution" and that "If the Constitution were taken literally, Julian would be a constitutional hero."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases designed to influence the reader, such as "rapacious power," "profound tragedy," "vindictive delight," and "brutalized."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an idea by associating it with a group like the Nazis or other groups universally hated by the target audience.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does the opposite of a bandwagon appeal. It laments the lack of popular support, stating, "The streets outside the embassy are virtually empty, whereas they should be full of people."

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex reasons for journalists' criticism of Assange by claiming, "so many of these journalists are shamed. They realize that WikiLeaks has done what they should have done a long time ago."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague or obscure; its arguments and accusations are direct and clearly stated, even if they are one-sided.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the statements of authorities to support its claims, citing "Rafael Correa, the former president of Ecuador" who called Assange's treatment "torture," and "The United Nations Working Party on Unlawful Detentions" to argue a "great miscarriage of justice had been imposed on him."

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark choice between two sides: Assange and WikiLeaks, who are "truth-tellers" fighting for justice, and a monolithic system of "corrupt media" and "rapacious power." It leaves no room for a nuanced position.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like "There is a morality in transparency" and "our right to know" as absolute principles that discourage critical thought about the potential complexities or downsides of releasing all information.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the Israeli-Palestinian conflict near the end, describing it as "the ultimate collusion." While used to illustrate a point about media silence, it serves to distract from the central topic of Julian Assange and divert the reader's attention to a different, highly emotional issue.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the argument that "WikiLeaks is somehow in bed with the Russians" by pointing out that it published documents critical of Russia. This misrepresents the more specific allegation that WikiLeaks was a witting or unwitting conduit for Russian intelligence in the 2016 election, instead refuting a broader, easier-to-disprove claim of a general alliance.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects from the case against Assange by charging opponents with hypocrisy, asking, "...what about Judith Miller and The New York Times lying the West into war?" This is a direct attempt to change the subject by pointing to the alleged wrongdoings of others.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform in a balanced way, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly polarized viewpoint: that Julian Assange is a heroic victim and that his opponents (the US government, mainstream media, the DNC) are a corrupt, malicious, and unified force.

The piece is not a news report but an interview with two of Assange's staunchest supporters, with no opposing or neutral viewpoints presented. It employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to achieve its goal. It uses **Name-calling** ("Russia-gate freaks") and **Loaded Language** ("rapacious power," "hell hole") to create a strong emotional bias against Assange's critics. It establishes a **Black & White Fallacy** by framing the conflict as a simple battle between truth/justice and a corrupt system.

Furthermore, it relies heavily on techniques to undermine opposing arguments, such as **Doubt** ("fakery of Russia-gate"), **Straw Men** (refuting that WikiLeaks is "in bed with the Russians"), and **Whataboutism** (bringing up Judith Miller and the Iraq War). It simplifies complex events with **Causal Oversimplification** and appeals to principles like the US Constitution (**Flag-Waving**) and UN findings (**Appeal to Authority**) to lend legitimacy to its one-sided argument.

The sheer density and combination of these techniques, all working in concert to promote a single narrative while actively discrediting all others, moves the text far beyond simple opinion or commentary and firmly into the realm of propaganda.
