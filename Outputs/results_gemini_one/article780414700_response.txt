Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the problem as a “beast” and labels bishops who do not act as “degenerate and even criminal shepherds.”

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the phrase “I am tired of…” three times consecutively for rhetorical effect: “I am tired of this. I am tired of people being hurt, gravely hurt! I am tired of the obfuscation of truth. I am tired of sin.”

Slogans – Yes – The text uses a capitalized, slogan-like phrase to rally support: “...join the fight to DEFEND BISHOP MORLINO last year.” It also uses the rallying cry, “This is what a courageous shepherd looks like!”

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns other bishops that if they do not follow Bishop Morlino’s example, they will “face the charge of being complicit with the degenerate and even criminal shepherds,” instilling fear of being associated with the guilty.

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the motives of silent Church leaders, asking, “Have we covered over the truth out of fear? Are we afraid of being disliked by people in this world?”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to describe the situation, calling it the “most vile clergy sex scandal in history” and stating that a “homosexual subculture… is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the shared religious identity of its audience, referring to them as “faithful Catholics” and framing the issue as a defense of the “Body of Christ, His Church” and a “sacred duty before God.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words such as “vile,” “degenerate,” “scurrilous,” “sickening,” “gruesome,” and “depravity” to evoke strong emotional responses.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests a growing movement of outrage that the reader should join, stating, “justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and ‘house cleaning’… I stand with them.”

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for the complex abuse crisis by stating, “It is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and explicit in its accusations and calls to action, and the author even states, “I am tired of the obfuscation of truth.”

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text relies on the authority of Bishop Morlino, and the Bishop himself appeals to higher authorities to justify his position, such as “St. Thomas Aquinas” and “the Book of Proverbs.”

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy to other bishops, stating they must “either follow suit or face the charge of being complicit,” which ignores other possible responses.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The letter concludes with the biblical phrase, “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord,” which is used as a final, non-debatable declaration of principle to end discussion.

Red herring – No – The text stays focused on the central topic of the clergy abuse crisis and its perceived causes and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the audience.

Straw men – Yes – The text sets up and refutes an oversimplified argument, stating that “the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia,” in order to dismiss it and introduce its own preferred explanation.

Whataboutism – No – The text makes direct accusations against others but does not do so in a way that deflects from a charge of hypocrisy against the author.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It systematically employs a vast majority of the listed techniques to advocate for a specific, highly controversial viewpoint and to rally support for a particular figure. The purpose is not to foster a nuanced understanding but to persuade through strong emotional manipulation, appeals to in-group identity (Flag-Waving for "faithful Catholics"), and logical fallacies. Techniques like Loaded Language ("vile," "degenerate"), Appeal to Fear (being "complicit"), Causal Oversimplification (blaming a "homosexual subculture"), and the Black & White Fallacy (either with us or against us) are used to frame the issue as a simple, urgent battle of good versus evil. The reliance on Appeal to Authority (the Bishop, St. Thomas Aquinas) and the use of Slogans and a Thought-terminating Cliché serve to solidify the message and discourage critical dissent. The combination of the editorial introduction and the Bishop's letter creates a powerful piece of persuasive communication designed to mobilize an audience, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
