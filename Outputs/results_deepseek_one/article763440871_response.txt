Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – *"Far-Left Bias"* (headline), *"Left-wing social engineering," "the craziness"* (used to describe transgender policies/student protests).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No significant repeated phrases or ideas beyond standard emphasis.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable rallying phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL" is absent).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – *"school shooting," "deadly school massacres," "violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments"* to promote homeschooling as a safer alternative.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – *"dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum"* and implied distrust of public school values/environment.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – *"phones started ringing... haven’t stopped yet," "our numbers have doubled," "exploded"* (minimizes public school efforts; exaggerates homeschooling surge causality).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – *"refusing to allow students to wear shirts... feature the American flag," "allowing students to ‘take a knee’ during the playing of the National Anthem"* (frames issues as anti-patriotic).  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – *"swamped," "fed up," "craziness," "unsafe environments," "Left-wing social engineering"* (emotionally charged negative terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No Nazi/Vichy comparisons.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – *"our numbers have doubled,"* testimonials (e.g., *"We couldn’t be happier"*), and data implying a growing movement.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes homeschooling surge primarily to *"school violence"* and *"Far-Left Bias"* while downplaying other factors (e.g., COVID-19, academic flexibility).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – No deliberately confusing language; arguments are presented directly.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites *"33-year-long study"* by the National Home Education Research Institute and quotes group leaders (Lambert/Chin).  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Implies homeschooling is the *only* solution to avoid violence, indoctrination, and family disunity (e.g., *"no better way"*).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – *"We couldn’t be happier," "few challenges have greater payoffs"* (shuts down critique with overly simplistic positivity).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introduces *"transgender students," "take a knee,"* and *"shirts... praising POTUS Trump"* as reasons for homeschooling—irrelevant to core academic/safety claims.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Portrays public schools as universally imposing *"Left-wing curriculum"* and suppressing patriotism (a broad misrepresentation of diverse school policies).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting opponents.  

---

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is highly likely propaganda. It employs **multiple loaded techniques** (Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language) to vilify public schools and valorize homeschooling. It **oversimplifies causality** (Causal Oversimplification) by blaming "Far-Left Bias" and violence while ignoring nuanced factors. The **Black & White Fallacy** frames homeschooling as the only moral choice, reinforced by **Bandwagon** appeals and **Thought-Terminating Clichés**. **Red Herrings** (e.g., transgender policies) distract from substantive debate. The author’s explicit agenda (*"eager to promote homeschooling"*) and personal testimonials further signal persuasive intent. While citing a study, the selective emphasis on fear-based/ideological reasons and omission of counter-evidence confirms a biased, propagandistic narrative.
