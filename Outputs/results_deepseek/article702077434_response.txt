### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques:
1. **Name calling** – No – The text uses factual labels ("first American citizen to be convicted," "defendant") without insulting epithets.  
2. **Repetition** – No – Key points (e.g., Khweis's regret, his success in joining ISIS) are stated once, not repeated excessively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No memorable phrases are used to summarize or promote an idea (e.g., no rallying cries like "Fight Terrorism!").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text reports facts (e.g., Khweis joined ISIS, prosecutors sought 35 years) but does not invoke fear of alternatives (e.g., no warnings like "This could happen to you").  
5. **Doubt** – No – The text does not question credibility manipulatively; it neutrally reports the prosecution’s accusation that Khweis lied ("accused Khweis of lying repeatedly").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Descriptions are measured (e.g., "unremarkable" life, "abused marijuana," "just three months"). No obvious amplification or downplaying.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism, nationality, or identity (e.g., no phrases like "betraying America").  
8. **Loaded Language** – No – Language is neutral (e.g., "interesting case," "regretted his actions"); no emotionally charged words or stereotypes.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler or universally hated groups to discredit Khweis or ISIS.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on popularity (e.g., no claims like "everyone agrees he is guilty").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text acknowledges complexity (e.g., defense attorney states, "We don’t really know what caused him"). No simplistic cause-effect claims.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are clear (e.g., timeline, charges, quotes); no ambiguous or confusing phrasing.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Authorities (FBI, prosecutors) are cited for factual reporting, not as unquestionable proof (e.g., prosecutor’s quote is evidence in context, not a generalized appeal).  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomies presented (e.g., no "either support this sentence or support terrorism" framing).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases that shut down debate (e.g., "It’s difficult to understand" invites reflection, doesn’t end it).  
16. **Red herring** – No – All details relate directly to Khweis’s case (e.g., his background, capture, trial); no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Arguments are represented accurately (e.g., prosecution refutes Khweis’s claim about "following a woman" by noting she "didn’t exist").  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no "what about other terrorists?" deflection).

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 10% –** The text is primarily a factual news report with minimal propagandistic elements. It neutrally presents details about Mohamad Khweis’s case, including his background, actions, defense, and prosecution arguments. Quotes from both sides (e.g., defense attorney’s confusion, prosecutor’s accusations) provide balance, and the tone avoids sensationalism or overt persuasion. The only minor propagandistic aspect is the subtle framing of Khweis as "successfully joining" ISIS (implying rarity and threat), but this is overshadowed by objective reporting. The article’s permission note ("posted with permission from The Daily Caller News Foundation") may hint at potential bias, but the content itself lacks systematic manipulation. Overall, it aligns with standard journalism rather than propaganda.
