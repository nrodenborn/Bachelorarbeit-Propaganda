Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "pathetic attempt at a cover-up" (insults the official investigation).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated references to helicopters being involved (e.g., "helicopter hovering overhead," "helicopters were used," "muzzle flashes coming from the helicopter").  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Implies helicopters were actively attacking civilians (e.g., "firing into the crowd from the air"), instilling fear about a government/military cover-up.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions the FBI's credibility ("the owner... was never approached by the FBI... much less investigated it").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates evidence ("seems to literally show a team of unknown soldiers") and minimizes the official story ("absolutely false... nothing more than a pathetic attempt").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or group identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotional/charged terms like "horrific attack," "astonishingly," "fateful night," "WTF video," and "massacre."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association with hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Appeals to popularity ("many believe," "a group of investigators who believe").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes debris/wind solely to a hovering helicopter while ignoring other plausible causes (e.g., panic, gunfire, environment).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – Unclear phrasing like "apparently that is due to," "seems to show," "remains unlikely," and "may show muzzle flashes."  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Uses Tucker Carlson (Fox News), Shepard Ambellas (Intellihub), and The Daily Sheeple as credible sources.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents only two options: official story ("false... cover-up") vs. helicopter attack theory (implied as truth).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to halt critical discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions; focus remains on helicopters.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Does not misrepresent opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy.  

---

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs numerous techniques to advance a conspiracy theory about the Las Vegas shooting:  
- **Emotional manipulation** (Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear) heightens tension.  
- **Misrepresentation of evidence** (Exaggeration, Causal Oversimplification) frames ambiguous footage (e.g., debris, lights) as definitive proof of helicopter involvement.  
- **Source bias** (Appeal to Authority) relies on fringe figures (Carlson, Ambellas, The Daily Sheeple) while dismissing official investigations.  
- **False dilemmas** (Black & White Fallacy) and **Bandwagon** appeals pressure readers to reject the official narrative.  
- **Doubt** and **Obfuscation** seed distrust without providing verifiable facts.  
The core goal is to delegitimize established accounts and promote a specific alternative theory, not objective analysis. While it poses questions, its selective evidence, manipulative language, and lack of counter-evidence analysis confirm a propagandistic intent.
