### Verdict – 15% –  
*Explanation:* The text is primarily a factual news report detailing a crime, arrests, and reactions. While elements of **Loaded Language** (e.g., "ambushed"), **Flag-Waving** ("true American heroes"), and **Appeal to Authority** (official statements) appear, these serve to emphasize the tragedy and honor the victims rather than manipulate readers toward a broader agenda. The tone is commemorative and emotional but lacks systematic persuasion tactics. Propaganda techniques are incidental (15%) rather than central, as the core purpose is informational, not coercive.
