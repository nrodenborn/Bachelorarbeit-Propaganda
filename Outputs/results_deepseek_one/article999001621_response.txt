### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Use of Techniques**: Employs 10/18 techniques (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, fear appeals, reduction ad Hitlerum) to discredit the Guardian. These are not isolated but form a cohesive attack strategy.  
2. **Emotive Language and Conspiracy Framing**: Labels the Guardian an "outlet for British government disinformation," claims it "regurgitates elite-serving narratives," and ties it to intelligence agencies without concrete evidence. This frames the outlet as a malicious actor, not a flawed institution.  
3. **Selective Evidence**: Highlights the Guardian’s retractions and errors while ignoring its editorial updates (e.g., adding denials). Uses Manafort’s passport records and WikiLeaks’ tweets as "proof" of intentional deceit, ignoring journalistic sourcing complexities.  
4. **Guilt by Association**: Links Luke Harding to plagiarism and intelligence ties to undermine his reporting, implying the entire Guardian is complicit.  
5. **Broad Generalizations**: Declares all Western media untrustworthy, using the Guardian as a synecdoche for systemic corruption.  
6. **Call to Action**: Ends by urging readers to "debunk [media] and educate the public," positioning itself as a truth-teller against a corrupt system.  

**Why not 100%?**  
- The text cites verifiable facts (e.g., the Guardian’s edits, WikiLeaks’ pre-publication denial) to support its critique, showing it is not *purely* fabrication. However, its framing, omissions, and hyperbolic language push it into propagandistic territory by distorting these facts into a narrative of deliberate malice.  

**Conclusion**: While based on real events, the text’s manipulative techniques, sweeping generalizations, and ideological agenda (e.g., anti-establishment, pro-WikiLeaks) overwhelmingly align with propaganda objectives. It seeks not just to critique but to delegitimize the Guardian and broader media as enemies of truth.
