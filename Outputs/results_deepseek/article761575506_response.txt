### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation*: No insulting labels are used against individuals or groups. Clinton’s statements are defensive but not derogatory.  

2. **Repetition** – No  
   *Explanation*: Key phrases (e.g., "I apologized publicly") are reiterated, but not to an extent that fits the definition of deliberate, manipulative repetition. The text reports statements without excessive redundancy.  

3. **Slogans** – No  
   *Explanation*: No brief, memorable phrases are used to simplify or rally support (e.g., no catchphrases like "Make America Great Again").  

4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
   *Explanation*: Clinton does not invoke fear of alternatives or consequences to sway opinion.  

5. **Doubt** – No  
   *Explanation*: Clinton does not question the credibility of others (e.g., Lewinsky or critics). He focuses on his own actions.  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation*: Clinton minimizes the need for a private apology to Lewinsky by asserting his public apology was sufficient: *"I apologized to everybody in the world"* and *"The apology was public."* This downplays her personal experience.  

7. **Flag-Waving** – No  
   *Explanation*: No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or loyalty.  

8. **Loaded Language** – No  
   *Explanation*: Language is neutral/reportorial. Emotional terms like "I felt terrible" are contextual, not manipulative.  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *Explanation*: No associations with hated groups to discredit ideas.  

10. **Bandwagon** – No  
    *Explanation*: No appeal to the popularity of Clinton’s stance (e.g., "everyone agrees with me").  

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No  
    *Explanation*: No oversimplified causes for complex issues (e.g., no claims like "the affair caused all my problems").  

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Clinton uses vague, non-specific language to avoid accountability: *"I came to grips with it"* and *"I dealt with it 20 years ago."* These phrases obscure concrete actions or remorse.  

13. **Appeal to authority** – No  
    *Explanation*: Clinton does not cite authority figures or institutions to validate his actions.  

14. **Black & white fallacy** – No  
    *Explanation*: No false dichotomies (e.g., "either accept my apology or be unreasonable").  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Clinton uses clichés to shut down scrutiny: *"I dealt with it 20 years ago"* implies the issue is resolved and discourages further discussion.  

16. **Red herring** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Clinton deflects from the apology issue by introducing irrelevant details: *"I left the White House $16 million in debt from my defense"* distracts from his accountability to Lewinsky.  

17. **Straw men** – No  
    *Explanation*: Clinton does not refute a misrepresented argument.  

18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    *Explanation*: No accusations of hypocrisy against critics (e.g., he does not say, "What about others who did worse?").

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 20% –**  
The text itself is **not propaganda** but a neutral news report summarizing Clinton’s interview and Lewinsky’s response. While Clinton employs minor propaganda techniques (minimization, obfuscation, red herring, thought-terminating clichés) to deflect accountability, these are embedded in his quoted statements rather than driving the article’s narrative. The article balances Clinton’s defensiveness with Lewinsky’s perspective (e.g., her PTSD and #MeToo reflections), avoiding overt bias. Propaganda techniques are present only in Clinton’s rhetoric (≈20% of the text’s focus), not in the reporting framework. The piece informs rather than manipulates, offering context and counterpoints.
