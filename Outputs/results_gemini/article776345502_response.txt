1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Jeff Sessions as a “weak sister” and the prosecutors as a “disgrace to USA.”

3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase “Witch Hunt” is used multiple times to refer to the investigation, serving as a brief and memorable label.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text describes the investigation as a “stealth coup,” which instills fear by suggesting a hidden, subversive plot to overthrow the government.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of Robert Mueller by stating, “Bob Mueller is totally conflicted.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text quotes Trump describing the Russia collusion allegation as a “TOTAL HOAX,” which is an extreme exaggeration of the situation.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by labeling the prosecutors a “disgrace to USA,” implying their actions are un-American.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “dirty work” and “Rigged Witch Hunt” to evoke negative feelings about the investigation.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of the investigation by associating it with groups the intended audience likely dislikes, such as in the phrases “leftwing witch hunt” and “his 17 Angry Democrats.”
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text mentions Trump opening up on Mueller “with both barrels of his massive Twitter following,” implying the popularity of his platform validates his message.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the cause of the investigation by stating it was used “to begin the Witch Hunt” because of the “phony and discredited Dossier” and a few named individuals, ignoring other contributing factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The language used in the text is generally direct and aggressive rather than intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text is centered on Donald Trump, the President, using his position of authority to demand action, as seen in the quote: “‘Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now.’”

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like “Rigged Witch Hunt” and “TOTAL HOAX” are used to dismiss the investigation outright, discouraging any nuanced discussion of its merits or findings.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text inserts a poll about Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation in the middle of an article about the Russia probe, which is an irrelevant topic meant to distract.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text notes that the Manafort trial was for financial crimes, but Trump reframes the prosecution as being about “Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign,” attacking an argument (collusion) that was not the central point of that specific trial.
18. Whataboutism – No – While the text attacks opponents, it does not specifically use the technique of charging them with hypocrisy for the same actions they are investigating.

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to objectively inform the reader but to persuade them to adopt a specific viewpoint—namely, that the Mueller investigation is illegitimate and should be stopped. The article achieves this by being saturated with propaganda techniques, both in its own framing (e.g., "Finally.", "weak sister") and, most significantly, through its extensive quotation of Donald Trump's statements. It employs a dense combination of emotional appeals (loaded language, appeal to fear, flag-waving), attacks on character (name-calling, doubt), and logical fallacies (causal oversimplification, straw men, red herring). The use of repetition, slogans, and thought-terminating clichés like "Witch Hunt" serves to reinforce a simple, negative message and shut down critical thought. The piece is constructed to create an echo chamber for a particular political perspective, making it a clear and potent example of propaganda.
