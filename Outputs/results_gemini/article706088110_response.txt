1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the judge Patti Saris as a “Kritarch,” an insulting term for a judge who governs tyrannically. It also repeatedly refers to the immigrants as “illegal aliens.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The phrase “illegal aliens” is used nine times, and the term “Final Order Of Removal” is repeated six times to hammer home the author’s point.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not employ any brief, memorable phrases to serve as a slogan for its ideas.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear by suggesting the judge’s actions will allow the immigrant to escape justice by “disappearing into the almost 1 million illegal aliens absconding from Final Orders of Removal,” implying a threat of widespread lawlessness.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text explicitly questions the credibility and motives of the judge (“Saris is clearly scheming to help Rombot escape deportation”) and the reporter (“symptomatic of the lies from reporters like Raymond”).
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the judge's power by claiming she “thinks she can usurp the Constitution of the United States based on her whims.” It also minimizes the immigrants' legal situation by claiming they “suddenly” filed claims after the election.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a defense of “the Constitution of the United States” against a judge who is supposedly violating it.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like “Kritarch,” “usurp,” “whims,” “scheming,” and “lies” to provoke a negative emotional response rather than engage in neutral description.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not a direct comparison to Hitler, the text uses a similar method by comparing Judge Saris to a “Mexican kritarch,” using the association with a foreign judge to discredit her in a debate on American immigration.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the entire complex legal conflict to a single cause: a rogue judge (“Kritarch Patti Saris”) acting on her “whims,” ignoring the complexities of asylum law and judicial review.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; its attacks and claims are direct and specific.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author appeals to the authority of the “Final Order Of Removal” and the “Constitution of the United States” as absolute and unquestionable evidence that the judge’s actions are illegitimate.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either one supports the immediate enforcement of the “Final Order Of Removal,” or one supports a judge who is trying to “usurp the Constitution.” It ignores the legitimate legal option of a judicial stay or review.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The constant repetition of “illegal aliens” with a “Final Order Of Removal” is used to shut down any further discussion or consideration of the individuals' circumstances or legal arguments.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the story of the “Mexican kritarch Monica Herranz,” which is irrelevant to the legal facts of a case in a U.S. federal court, in order to distract and create a negative association with Judge Saris.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the Reuters report, claiming it said Rombot was detained *because* of a policy to deport all illegal aliens. It then attacks this misrepresented argument as a "lie," when the original text only stated that a new policy made people like him *subject* to deportation.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism of one party by accusing another of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. It employs a vast majority (14 out of 18) of the listed techniques to advocate for its position. Rather than presenting a reasoned argument, the text relies heavily on emotional manipulation and logical fallacies. It uses name-calling (“Kritarch,” “illegal aliens”) and loaded language (“scheming,” “usurp”) to demonize the judge, the immigrants, and the media. It creates a false black-and-white choice between upholding the Constitution and allowing judicial tyranny, ignoring legal nuance. The author builds a straw man of the reporter's argument to discredit it, introduces a red herring about a Mexican judge to create a negative association, and repeatedly appeals to fear and authority. The goal is not to inform the reader but to incite anger and delegitimize any opposition to a specific, hardline immigration viewpoint.
