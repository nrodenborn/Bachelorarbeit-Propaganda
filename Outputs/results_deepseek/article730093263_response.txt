Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are directly applied to Smith. The text reports his alleged actions neutrally (e.g., "charged with aggravated murder").  
2. **Repetition** – No – The core message about race omission is stated once but not repeated throughout.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used (e.g., "Black Murders Of White Cops" is a category label, not a standalone slogan).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – While the incident is violent, the text does not use it to instill fear against alternatives (e.g., immigration policies or social groups).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Explicitly questions media credibility: "since except for the photograph, there's no mention of the race issue."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates media intent: Claims race is omitted entirely ("no mention"), though the photo’s absence does not prove systemic avoidance.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Uses emotionally charged phrasing like "Black Murders Of White Cops," implying racial conflict.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association with hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes media silence on race solely to bias, ignoring other factors (e.g., ongoing investigations or editorial standards).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is direct and clear.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Cites police reports neutrally; not used as rhetorical evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents a false dichotomy: "If these two men had survived... you’d be hearing a lot about the race issue," ignoring nuanced reporting possibilities.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Black Murders Of White Cops" frames the event as part of a pattern, discouraging deeper analysis.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Domestic violence details distract from the race/media critique (e.g., lengthy quotes about Candace Smith’s allegations).  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 70% –**  
The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques—including loaded language, doubt, exaggeration, causal oversimplification, black-and-white fallacy, thought-terminating clichés, and red herring—to advance a narrative of media bias and racial conflict. Its selective framing (e.g., emphasizing Smith’s race while accusing media of suppression) and emotionally charged categorization ("Black Murders Of White Cops") prioritize ideological messaging over objective reporting. However, it incorporates factual police reports and avoids overt falsehoods, reducing the likelihood to 70% rather than higher. The core intent aligns with propaganda: shaping perception through manipulative techniques rather than balanced discourse.
