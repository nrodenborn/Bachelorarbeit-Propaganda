Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Donald Trump describing the group of migrants as an "impending migrant 'invasion,'" which is an insulting and dehumanizing label.

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times in a row in the middle of the article.

Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text builds fear by describing "thousands of migrants" being met by "barbed wire and American forces," an "impending migrant 'invasion,'" and a massive military deployment including "drones, helicopters with night-vision capabilities, and fixed-wing aircraft."

Doubt – No – The text does not explicitly question the credibility of any person or group.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text quotes Donald Trump calling the caravan an "invasion," which is an exaggeration of the nature of a group of migrants.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the story as a defense of the "United States" border by "American forces" from the "Army and Marine Corps" against an outside group.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases such as "They Are Coming," "illegal entry," and "invasion" to create a negative emotional response in the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The article frames the complex issue of migration as a simple problem of "illegal entry," with the implied solution being military force, ignoring the complex socio-economic reasons driving the caravan.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is generally direct and not deliberately obscure in its language.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the actions and quotes of President Trump as the primary justification and evidence for the events, such as when it states, "President Trump has effectively suspended the granting of asylum to migrants who cross illegally."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll about Jim Acosta presents a loaded binary choice: "Yes, he should have gotten it back" versus "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass," which presents only two simplified options while biasing one of them.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The poll option, "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass," functions as a thought-terminating cliché by dismissing a complex issue of press freedom with a simplistic and judgmental phrase that discourages further discussion.

Red herring – Yes – The article is about a migrant caravan, but it introduces a prominent and repeated poll about journalist Jim Acosta's press pass, a completely unrelated topic meant to distract the reader.

Straw men – No – The text does not set up and refute a distorted version of an opponent's argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs a significant number of propaganda techniques to construct a specific, fear-based narrative. The piece uses an ominous title ("They Are Coming") and loaded language ("invasion," "illegal entry") to dehumanize the migrants and frame them as a threat. It heavily utilizes appeal to fear by detailing a massive military response with "barbed wire," "drones," and "helicopters with night-vision capabilities." The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring poll about Jim Acosta serves to distract and engage the reader on a separate, politically charged issue. The article oversimplifies a complex humanitarian situation into a black-and-white issue of national security, relying on the appeal to authority of the president to validate its claims. The combined effect of these techniques is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a fearful and hostile view of the migrant caravan.
