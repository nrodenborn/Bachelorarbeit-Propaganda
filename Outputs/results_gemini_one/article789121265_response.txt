15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation: The phrase, “That shows you the difference in the double standard that existed back then and still does today,” is used to present a conclusion as self-evident and shut down further critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – Explanation: The article includes a completely unrelated poll: "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?", which serves to distract the reader from the main topic.
17. Straw men – Yes – Explanation: The text refutes a simplified version of the Democratic position, implying they hold a simplistic "believe all accusers" stance, and then attacks that position using Broaddrick's case, rather than addressing the more specific arguments about an FBI investigation for a Supreme Court nominee.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – Explanation: The entire article is structured around this technique, deflecting from the issue of the Kavanaugh accusation by repeatedly asking what about the Broaddrick accusation against Bill Clinton. This is encapsulated in the line: "Where was mine?"

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the reader by reinforcing a partisan viewpoint. This is achieved through the heavy use of numerous propaganda techniques, most notably Whataboutism, which forms the core structure of the argument. The article employs loaded language ("Clinton machine," "flimsy and meritless"), name-calling ("FRAUD"), and logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy and causal oversimplification to portray Democrats as hypocrites. It relies on emotional appeals to anger and injustice rather than a balanced presentation of facts, making it a clear example of political propaganda.
