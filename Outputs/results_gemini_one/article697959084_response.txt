Name calling – No – The text accuses authorities of actions like lying and covering up, but it does not use a specific insulting label to attack them.

Repetition – Yes – The core message that the official story is a lie and that there was a cover-up is repeated throughout the text. For example: "contradicts the official story", "authorities have so far done everything in their power to cover-up", and "it is strikingly obvious that authorities have lied to the American people".

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable, or chant-like phrases.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting that the authorities (police, FBI) are deliberately lying to the public about the "worst mass shooting in American history," implying a conspiracy and that citizens cannot trust those in charge of their safety.

Doubt – Yes – The entire purpose of the text is to cast doubt on the credibility of the official narrative. For example: "In yet another astonishing eyewitness report that contradicts the official story" and "Slowly but surely we are starting to see the official narrative regarding the Las Vegas Massacre be completely destroyed."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggerated language to strengthen its claims. For example: "official narrative regarding the Las Vegas Massacre be completely destroyed" and "At this point it is strikingly obvious that authorities have lied".

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to national identity by framing the alleged deception as a betrayal of the American public. For example: "police and the FBI has hidden from the American people" and "authorities have lied to the American people about the worst mass shooting in our countries history."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader. Examples include "astonishing eyewitness report", "confessional", "crescendo of screams", and "strikingly obvious".

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other universally hated groups.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that a growing number of people are realizing the "truth," creating an appeal to join the popular opinion. For example: "This testimony also backs up claims by another eyewitness, Rene Downs" and "Slowly but surely we are starting to see the official narrative... be completely destroyed."

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause (a deliberate cover-up by authorities) for a complex situation (conflicting reports during a chaotic mass-casualty event), ignoring other potential explanations like mass panic, confusion, or misinterpretation of sounds.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its accusations and is not deliberately unclear or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents an "eyewitness" as the primary authority and evidence for its claims, treating his personal account as infallible proof. For example: "The eyewitness then goes on to directly say that he and his wife were involved in an active shooter situation... There is no mistake in my mind about it".

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either the official story is a complete lie and a cover-up, or the eyewitness account is the absolute truth. It does not allow for nuance, such as the possibility of the eyewitness being mistaken in a chaotic situation.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that present a conclusion as settled fact to discourage further questioning. For example: "At this point it is strikingly obvious that authorities have lied to the American people."

Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central claim and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the audience.

Straw men – No – The text attacks the actual "official story" rather than misrepresenting it or refuting an argument that was not made.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge authorities with hypocrisy by deflecting to an unrelated issue.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific conspiracy theory. It achieves this by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques. The piece heavily relies on casting **Doubt** on official institutions and uses emotionally **Loaded Language** and **Appeals to Fear** to create a sense of betrayal and urgency. It presents its case using a **Black & White Fallacy**, where the only options are the official "lie" or the eyewitness "truth." The argument is bolstered by **Exaggeration** ("completely destroyed," "strikingly obvious"), **Repetition** of the core conspiracy claim, and an **Appeal to Authority** that treats anecdotal testimony as indisputable fact. By framing the issue as a deception of "the American people" (**Flag-Waving**), it creates an in-group (those who know the "truth") and an out-group (the lying authorities). The cumulative effect of these techniques is a powerful piece of persuasion designed to bypass critical analysis and promote a specific, unsubstantiated narrative.
