Verdict – 70% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to shape the reader's perception of the migrant caravan and the political situation, suggesting a high likelihood that the text is propaganda. However, the absence of some techniques, such as slogans, reduction ad Hitlerum, bandwagon, and whataboutism, indicates that not all possible propaganda methods are employed.
