**14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation:**  
The text presents the situation as a stark choice between believing “facts” (as presented by the author) and believing “lies” (as presented by the media and government), with no middle ground.

**15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation:**  
Phrases like “Those are the facts, and I am in a position to give you a personal assurance of them” discourage further questioning.

**16. Red herring – Yes – Explanation:**  
The lengthy discussion of visitor logs and embassy procedures distracts from the core issue of whether the documents are genuine or not.

**Verdict – 95% – The text exhibits a wide range of classic propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, thought-terminating clichés, red herrings, straw men, and whataboutism. The overwhelming presence of these techniques, combined with the text’s emotionally charged and polarizing language, strongly indicates that it is propaganda. The only reason it is not 100% is that there is some factual content and personal testimony, but the overwhelming use of propaganda techniques makes it highly likely (95%) that this text is propaganda.**
