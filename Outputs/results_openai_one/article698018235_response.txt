Certainly! Here is the analysis according to your requested format:

---

1. **Name calling** – Yes – The text uses insulting labels such as “radical anti-Israel hate group”, “anti-Israel BDS hate group”, “anti-Semite”, “whines”, “entitled nonsense”, “whining”, and “#BDStears crowd”.

2. **Repetition** – Yes – The phrase “#BDStears” is repeated multiple times to mock BDS supporters.

3. **Slogans** – Yes – The hashtag “#BDStears” functions as a slogan, as does the phrase “what's good for the goose is good for the gander”.

4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text suggests that BDS supporters want to “burn crosses on their lawn”, invoking fear of anti-Semitic violence.

5. **Doubt** – Yes – The text questions the credibility of Dan Fishback and JVP by calling them “anti-Israel hate group” and suggesting they have “links to anti-Semitism”.

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The text exaggerates by equating BDS supporters with the KKK and the PLO, and by saying they want to “burn crosses on their lawn”.

7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – The text appeals to Jewish identity and patriotism, e.g., “the existence of Jewish nationhood”, “the Jews of Israel”, and “the human rights of the Jewish people”.

8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like “hate group”, “entitled nonsense”, “whines”, and “propaganda campaign” are emotionally charged.

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – The text compares BDS supporters to the KKK, a group universally reviled, to discredit them.

10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no clear appeal to popularity or suggestion that “everyone” is against BDS or Dan Fishback.

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text oversimplifies the motives and actions of BDS supporters, e.g., “the only dissent and argument that Jews are supposed to welcome is that of people who hate the existence of Jewish nationhood”.

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – The text uses vague accusations like “links to anti-Semitism” and “collaborating with JVP” without specifics.

13. **Appeal to authority** – No – The text does not cite authorities to support its arguments.

14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text presents only two options: either support Jewish nationhood or be aligned with anti-Semitic hate groups.

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Phrases like “entitled nonsense” and “what's good for the goose is good for the gander” shut down further discussion.

16. **Red herring** – Yes – The mention of “burn crosses on their lawn” distracts from the actual issue of boycotts and free speech.

17. **Straw men** – Yes – The text misrepresents Fishback’s argument, suggesting he wants only anti-Zionist dissent to be allowed, which is not directly stated.

18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – The text accuses Fishback of hypocrisy: “even while they advocate a boycott of the Jews of Israel... Now he's whining that boycotting his play is a violation of Jewishness”.

---

**Verdict – 95% – The text exhibits nearly all major propaganda techniques, including name calling, loaded language, repetition, slogans, appeal to fear, exaggeration, black & white fallacy, and more. It consistently uses emotionally charged language, presents the opposition as hypocritical and dangerous, and simplifies complex issues into binary choices. The text’s primary purpose appears to be to discredit and delegitimize BDS supporters and Dan Fishback rather than to inform or engage in balanced debate, making it highly likely to be propaganda.**
