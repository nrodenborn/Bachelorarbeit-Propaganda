1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Amber Guyger as a "killer cop."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively in the text.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the style of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text describes Amber Guyger as a "threat to society," which aims to instill fear about the consequences of her remaining on the police force.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is framed to cast doubt on the credibility of Chief Renee Hall's statements, directly stating "But experts say this is not true" and quoting an attorney who was "completely mystified" by her comments.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses the phrase "cold-blooded killing," which is an exaggeration used to heighten the emotional impact of the event.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "cold-blooded killing," "killer cop," and describes the victim as an "innocent, pillar of society" to appeal to the reader's emotions and create a strong bias.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to hated groups like the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The article begins by stating, "As citizens call for justice," which suggests a popular movement that the reader should join.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the reason for Guyger not being fired to the police department's desire to "keep a killer cop on their payroll," dismissing the potentially complex legal and procedural reasons cited by the chief as simple excuses.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is not intentionally vague; on the contrary, it accuses the Dallas Police Department of using this technique ("Exactly what 'investigative process' needs to happen before they can fire her remains unclear...").
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the authority of "experts," a "civil rights attorney," and the news outlet "WFAA" to support its argument against the Police Chief.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as one of two options: either the Chief is lying to protect an officer, or the article's interpretation is correct. It dismisses the possibility of a more complex reality involving legal procedure or misinformation.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases or clichés to shut down discussion.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about who should replace Nikki Haley is entirely unrelated to the article's content and serves as a distraction to engage the reader and collect data.
17. Straw men – No – The text directly engages with and attempts to refute the Chief's stated argument, rather than misrepresenting it and attacking a weaker version.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text uses comparisons to past firings to accuse the department of hypocrisy, which is a direct line of argumentation, not a deflection tactic to avoid criticism.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it is based on a real news event and contains factual elements (such as direct quotes from the police chief), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly critical viewpoint of the Dallas Police Department. The article achieves this through a dense application of propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on emotional manipulation through Loaded Language ("cold-blooded killing," "pillar of society") and Name-calling ("killer cop"). It constructs its argument by casting Doubt on official statements, using Appeals to Authority ("experts," WFAA) to validate its own position, and employing logical fallacies like Causal Oversimplification and the Black & White Fallacy to frame the police department's actions as simple corruption. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant Red Herring poll further underscores that the publisher's intent goes beyond journalism and into engagement, persuasion, and data collection. The combination of these techniques creates a biased narrative designed to provoke outrage and solidify a negative opinion, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
