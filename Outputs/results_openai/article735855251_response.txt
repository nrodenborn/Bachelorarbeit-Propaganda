Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as appeal to fear, exaggeration/minimization, flag-waving, loaded language, and appeal to authority. These elements suggest that the text is likely intended to influence public perception of ICE operations and the individuals targeted by these operations. However, the text also provides factual information about the arrests, which tempers the likelihood of it being pure propaganda. Therefore, there is a moderate likelihood that the text is propaganda.
