Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1. **Name calling** – No – The text describes Farrakhan’s remarks as "anti-Semitic," "incendiary," and "bigoted," but these are factual descriptors of his statements (e.g., "Jews were ‘responsible for all of this filth’"). No insulting labels are used to attack him beyond reporting his own words and established critiques.  
2. **Repetition** – No – No phrase or message is repeated excessively. The text covers multiple facets of the story without redundancy.  
3. **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to persuade (e.g., no rallying cries like "BUILD THE WALL").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text reports on controversies but does not instill fear about alternatives (e.g., no warnings about consequences of not condemning Farrakhan).  
5. **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of sources. It neutrally presents statements (e.g., "Mr. Farrakhan has denied that he is anti-Semitic").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Descriptions are measured (e.g., "incendiary remarks" aligns with quoted speech; no downplaying of Farrakhan’s views).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or group identity to manipulate opinion.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Terms like "incendiary remarks," "bigoted remarks," and "unbelievably vile" (from Professor Chireau) evoke strong emotions. Example: "his political positions regarding the country frequently spill over into bigoted remarks about Jews."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – Though Hitler is mentioned ("description of Adolf Hitler as ‘a very great man’"), it is not used to discredit an idea by association. It is reported as part of Farrakhan’s history.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Popularity is not used to validate Farrakhan’s views (e.g., no claims like "many support him").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Complex issues (e.g., Nation of Islam’s history) are explained with nuance, not reduced to single causes.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific (e.g., dates, sources, and quotes are provided).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Expert sources (e.g., Edward E. Curtis IV, Yvonne Chireau) and organizations (e.g., Anti-Defamation League) are cited to lend credibility. Example: "Edward E. Curtis IV... said that while estimates ranged wildly... he believes that there were tens of thousands of members."  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Multiple perspectives are shown (e.g., Farrakhan’s defenders vs. critics), avoiding false dichotomies.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases discourage critical analysis (e.g., nuanced discussions of Mallory’s stance are included).  
16. **Red herring** – No – All content is relevant to Farrakhan’s controversies (e.g., no irrelevant distractions).  
17. **Straw men** – No – Arguments are represented accurately (e.g., Mallory’s statements are quoted directly, not misrepresented).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., the text does not deflect criticism by citing others’ flaws).  

**Verdict – 10% –**  
The text is primarily **informational journalism**, not propaganda. It objectively reports facts, quotes multiple sources (critics and defenders), and provides historical context without overt persuasion. The minimal propagandistic elements (e.g., **Loaded Language** and **Appeal to Authority**) serve to contextualize Farrakhan’s notoriety but do not dominate the narrative. Neutral framing (e.g., stating the ADL’s view while including counterpoints like Muhammad’s admiration) and balanced reporting on controversies (e.g., Mallory’s non-condemnation vs. Davis’s retraction) further support its journalistic intent. The 10% likelihood reflects minor emotional language, not systemic manipulation.
