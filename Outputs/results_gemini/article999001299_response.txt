1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to CNN and Jim Acosta as “lying CNN and lying Jim Acosta,” calls Acosta “little Jimmy” and a “rude, terrible person,” and labels CNN the “Clown News Network” and a “propaganda outlet.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?” is repeated three times in a row.

3. Slogans – No – The text uses insults and clichés but does not employ a brief, original, and memorable phrase to encapsulate an idea.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text attempts to instill fear of being deceived by a trusted source, stating, “Fox News is largely controlled opposition despite what many may think,” and concluding with, “Do you see who they really are now? If not, I can't help you,” implying a danger in not seeing this supposed truth.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire premise of the article is to cast doubt on the credibility of Fox News as a conservative outlet, as stated in the opening line: “Fox News is largely controlled opposition despite what many may think.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the significance of Fox News filing an amicus brief by framing it as a moment where they “pulled the mask off, people,” suggesting a grand conspiracy was revealed by a routine legal action.

7. Flag-Waving – No – While the text discusses American political institutions like the White House and the First Amendment, it does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its argument.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as “neo-cons running rampant,” “belligerent,” “weaponized,” “antagonistic,” and “immature children.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or other groups widely hated by the audience.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The author notes that “several prominent media members – such as Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate journalist Bob Woodward – have criticized CNN over the lawsuit,” implying that since other important people agree, the reader should too.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies Fox News’s complex decision to support CNN’s legal effort as being caused by one simple thing: that they are not truly conservative but are “controlled opposition.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s language is blunt and direct, not deliberately unclear or obscure.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites President Donald Trump, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, and journalist Bob Woodward to lend credibility to their position (e.g., “Trump was right, Acosta is a ‘rude, terrible person.’”).

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy in its closing lines: “Do you see who they really are now? If not, I can't help you.” This suggests there are only two options: either you agree with the author’s conclusion about Fox News, or you are beyond help.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “If not, I can't help you” is used to end the argument and dismiss any potential disagreement without further discussion.

16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central argument about Fox News, CNN, and Jim Acosta, without introducing irrelevant topics to distract the reader.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes a simplified version of the press freedom argument, framing it as “if it is a right to have a press pass to the White House, where is mine? and yours?” This misrepresents the actual legal argument, which was about the arbitrary revocation of credentials without due process, not about a universal right for every citizen to have a pass.

18. Whataboutism – No – The author directly attacks CNN and Fox News but does not use their alleged wrongdoings to deflect from a criticism aimed at the author or their allies.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and overt piece of propaganda. It employs a vast majority (12 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques to make its case. Rather than relying on reasoned debate or a balanced presentation of facts, the article heavily uses emotional manipulation through name-calling and loaded language to create hostility towards its subjects (CNN, Acosta, and Fox News). It builds its argument on a foundation of logical fallacies, including causal oversimplification, a black & white fallacy, and a straw man argument. The author actively works to undermine the credibility of a media outlet by casting doubt and appealing to fear, while simultaneously using appeals to authority to bolster their own position. Finally, it uses thought-terminating clichés to shut down critical thinking and discourage dissent. The primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the audience to adopt a specific, highly biased viewpoint by stoking anger and distrust.
