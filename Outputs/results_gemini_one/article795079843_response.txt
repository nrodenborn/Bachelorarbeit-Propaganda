1. Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels. It uses descriptive political terms like “autocratic Saudi leadership” and “powerful son,” but these are used to provide context rather than as simple insults.
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat a specific message or phrase to persuade the audience. It presents a narrative of events in a standard journalistic style.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to push an agenda.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text describes a tense and serious situation (“diplomatic crisis”) but does not attempt to instill fear in the reader to support a particular idea. It reports on the facts of the situation.
5. Doubt – No – The author reports on facts that may cause the reader to doubt the credibility of the Saudi government (e.g., “Saudi officials insisted that Khashoggi left the consulate but have provided no video or other evidence”), but the author is not directly casting doubt, but rather reporting on a lack of evidence.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text reports on President Trump's potential minimization of the Saudi rulers' involvement by suggesting “‘rogue killers,’” but the author herself does not engage in exaggeration or minimization. The reporting is factual and measured.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions U.S. interests and the U.S.-Saudi alliance, but it does so in a factual, geopolitical context, not as an emotional appeal to patriotism.
8. Loaded Language – No – The author uses descriptive words like “shocking death” and “growing furor,” but these accurately describe the events and the public reaction to them rather than being used to manipulate the reader's emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to hated groups like the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is correct because it is popular. It reports that “Many members of Congress have demanded” action, which is a factual statement about a specific group, not a bandwagon appeal.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text avoids oversimplification. In fact, it does the opposite by providing complex context, including the U.S.-Saudi alliance, oil, arms deals, and efforts to constrain Iran.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is a clear news report. It is direct about what is known and what is unknown. The vagueness reported in the text comes from the subjects of the story (e.g., the Saudi officials), not the author.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text cites numerous authorities and officials (Pompeo, Trump, Heather Nauert), but this is standard journalistic attribution, not a logical fallacy. The author is reporting what people said, not using their authority as proof of a claim.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text presents a complex situation with multiple actors and potential outcomes, avoiding a simple two-sided, black-and-white presentation.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text is written to inform the reader and encourage understanding of a complex issue, not to shut down thought with clichés.
16. Red herring – No – All the information provided, such as the history of the U.S.-Saudi alliance, is relevant context for understanding the diplomatic crisis at hand.
17. Straw men – No – The text accurately presents the positions and statements of the various parties involved without misrepresenting them.
18. Whataboutism – No – The author does not engage in charging anyone with hypocrisy to deflect from the issue.

Verdict – 5% – This text is a piece of standard journalism, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about an ongoing event by reporting the facts as they are known. The author, Tracy Wilkinson, adheres to journalistic principles by:
1.  Attributing all statements, opinions, and speculations to their specific sources (e.g., President Trump, the State Department, Turkish media, critics).
2.  Providing multiple perspectives on the event, including those of the U.S. government, the Saudi government, and their critics.
3.  Using neutral, descriptive language rather than emotionally loaded or manipulative wording.
4.  Supplying relevant context about the U.S.-Saudi relationship to help the reader understand the complexities and stakes of the situation.

The text *reports on* actions and statements that could be considered propaganda or disinformation (such as Trump’s “rogue killers” suggestion or the Saudi’s floated story of an interrogation gone awry), but it clearly frames them as attributed statements rather than adopting them as fact. This distinction between reporting on propaganda and creating propaganda is crucial. Therefore, the text itself is a factual news report with a very low likelihood of being propaganda.
