Name calling – Yes – The text labels Theresa May’s government as a “relentlessly appeasement-minded government.”
Repetition – Yes – The central message that the UK government bans critics of jihad while admitting its proponents is repeated throughout the text with different examples.
Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by highlighting that the UK government admits individuals who preach extreme violence, such as Shaykh Hamza Sodagar who is quoted as saying “chop their head off... burn them to death.”
Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the UK Home Office’s stated reasons for the ban, suggesting the real reason is that “They were bowing to jihadist intimidation.”
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the actions of the banned activists as simply “telling the truth about Islam and jihad,” while describing the UK’s actions as admitting jihad preachers “without a moment of hesitation.”
Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity using symbols or patriotic language.
Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases such as “jihad violence,” “preachers of hatred,” and “bowing to jihadist intimidation” to evoke an emotional response from the reader.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or group to the Nazis or other similarly hated groups.
Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its ideas are popular or that the reader should agree because many others do.
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex reasons for the UK’s immigration and exclusion policies by stating the government’s actions are simply because “They were bowing to jihadist intimidation.”
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and makes clear accusations rather than using intentionally vague or confusing language.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites Breitbart as a source for its claims: “According to Breitbart, ‘Sellner, who described the detention centre as looking akin to a typical American prison...’”
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text creates a false dichotomy where the UK government either bans “foes of jihad terror” or admits its “proponents,” ignoring any other possibilities or nuances in its immigration and security policies.
Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use cliché phrases designed to shut down discussion.
Red herring – No – The examples provided, while inflammatory, are all used to support the central argument of hypocrisy and are not irrelevant distractions.
Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the UK Home Office’s stated reason for the ban (“could cause violence”) by re-framing it as a weaker argument that is easier to attack: that the government specifically fears violence “from Muslims” and is “bowing to jihadist intimidation.”
Whataboutism – Yes – The entire text is structured around this technique, deflecting from the reasons for the activists’ ban by repeatedly asking, in effect, “What about all the preachers of jihad and terrorists the UK has admitted?”

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its entire structure is built upon a foundation of Whataboutism, designed not to engage with the reasons for the activists' ban but to deflect by accusing the UK government of hypocrisy. This framework is supported by a host of other techniques. It employs a stark Black & White Fallacy, dividing the world into "free speech activists" who are "telling the truth" and an "appeasement-minded" government that welcomes "preachers of jihad violence." It uses highly Loaded Language ("bowing to jihadist intimidation," "preachers of hatred") and a strong Appeal to Fear (with graphic quotes about murder and mentions of terrorism) to provoke an emotional response rather than rational analysis. The author's position is minimized as simply "telling the truth," while the complex legal and social issues surrounding immigration and public order are reduced to a Causal Oversimplification: the government is merely appeasing extremists. The goal is not to inform or foster a nuanced debate, but to persuade the reader of a specific, one-sided, and emotionally charged viewpoint by portraying the author and his allies as victims of a corrupt and dangerous system.
