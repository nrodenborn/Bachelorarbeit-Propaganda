---

**Verdict – 40%** – The text exhibits mild propagandistic elements (notably *Doubt*, *Loaded Language*, and *Appeal to Authority*) through Rick’s claims and the article’s framing of his testimony as "intriguing" while subtly undermining official narratives. However, it avoids overt emotional manipulation, repetition, or fearmongering. The inclusion of counterpoints (e.g., noting perpetrators often hide intentions) and neutral prompts (*"What do you think?"*) reduces bias. The primary goal appears to be amplifying alternative theories rather than coercive persuasion, but sourcing from *Infowars* (a known conspiracy outlet) and highlighting unverified claims leans toward speculative propaganda. The percentage reflects low-to-moderate likelihood due to restrained execution but clear ideological framing.
