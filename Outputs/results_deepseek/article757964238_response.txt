Here's the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No specific insulting label is applied to opponents (though implied disapproval of government exists).
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – "Protect The Harvest" (the organization name) functions as a brief, memorable phrase representing their cause.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While injustice is implied, the text focuses more on seeking redress (pardon) than actively instilling fear *against alternatives*.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "when the mainstream wouldn't cover them" casts doubt on the credibility of mainstream media reporting on the Bundy Ranch case.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "gross miscarriage of justice", "blight on the federal regulatory agencies", and "the furthest thing from terrorists" are strong exaggerations/minimizations. Calling Finicum's death "murder" (assuming a typo for murder) is also a loaded minimization of the circumstances (implied unjust killing).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "Rural communities of the West are greatly appreciative of the efforts of the Trump administration to restore the economies of these communities" appeals to regional/national identity and patriotism.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Numerous examples: "targeted", "unmitigated 'terrorism' charges" (scare quotes), "prison for profit system", "murder", "manifest miscarriage of justice", "blight", "hard-working, family ranchers", "humble ranchers". These words carry strong emotional connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "many who have seen... are calling", "The Hammond case is viewed by many...", "Many of you followed these stories", and the call to sign the petition all appeal to popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes the Malheur protest and Finicum's death solely to the Hammond case ("Their story ultimately led to..."), oversimplifying complex events.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – "doing what ranchers do" (vague justification for fires), "unmitigated 'terrorism' charges" (vague why charges are unmitigated), "crimes" (of prosecutor Myhre - unspecified). Details about the fires, legal proceedings, and Finicum's death are omitted.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No specific authority figure (besides Trump being petitioned) is cited to support the claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Implies the only options are viewing the Hammonds as innocent "hard-working, family ranchers" or terrorists, and that pardoning them is the only just solution. Ignores nuances of the case.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Phrases like "hard-working, family ranchers", "simply were doing their job", "gross miscarriage of justice", and "blight on the federal regulatory agencies" shut down deeper analysis of the legal specifics.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The poll about "the most corrupt Democrat Politician" and the lengthy disclaimer about poll signup are completely irrelevant to the Hammond case or the pardon request, distracting from the main issue.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text doesn't explicitly refute an argument not presented. It attacks the government's actions and charges, which *were* presented.
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – "but when we asked for people to step up and sign a petition to bring Bundy Ranch prosecutor Steven Myhre to justice for his crimes, we couldn't get 1,000 signatures" deflects from the current petition by pointing to perceived hypocrisy/inconsistency in audience action on a different issue.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques, particularly Loaded Language, Bandwagon, Obfuscation, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating Clichés, and Whataboutism, alongside Repetition, Flag-Waving, Causal Oversimplification, and Exaggeration. Its primary goal is not balanced reporting but to evoke strong sympathy for the Hammonds, vilify the government/media, and drive petition signatures through emotional manipulation, oversimplification, distraction (Red Herring poll), and appeals to group identity/popularity. While based on real events, the presentation is heavily skewed and employs classic propaganda methods to persuade rather than inform objectively. The lack of critical details, reliance on emotionally charged labels, and diversionary tactics confirm its propagandistic nature.
