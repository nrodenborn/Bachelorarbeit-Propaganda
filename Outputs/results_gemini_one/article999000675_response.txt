Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative viewpoint towards Louis Farrakhan and, by extension, the Democratic party. It achieves this by employing a multitude of propaganda techniques. The piece heavily relies on **Name Calling** and **Loaded Language** (e.g., "racist," "totalitarian," "domestic terrorist," "criminal traitor") to provoke an emotional response rather than a rational one. The central strategy is guilt by association, explicitly stated in the headline ("Democrat’s Friend") and body ("many of them US Democrats"), which is a form of **Exaggeration**. It uses **Flag-Waving** and **Appeal to Fear** by framing the issue as a matter of national security and "treason," pressuring the reader to agree or risk appearing unpatriotic. While it uses **Appeal to Authority** by citing news sources to create a veneer of credibility, the overwhelming use of emotional manipulation, vilification, and partisan attacks confirms its propagandistic nature.
