Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Repeated use of the term "criminal aliens" (used 5 times) as an insulting label for arrestees.  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "criminal aliens" is repeated throughout, and "previously deported" is emphasized 7 times in case summaries.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases designed for rallying support (e.g., "Make America Great Again").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Lists violent crimes (sexual assault, kidnapping) and states sanctuary policies "put our communities at risk."  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Criticizes "reckless sanctuary policies" and local law enforcement for not honoring detainers, undermining their credibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Emphasizes serious crimes (aggravated sexual assault) while minimizing context (only 6 of 22 had felony charges listed).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: References "protect the nation" and "integrity of our immigration laws" as patriotic duties.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Terms like "reckless sanctuary policies," "fugitive immigration violators," and "criminal aliens" evoke negative emotions.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No association of ideas with hated groups (e.g., Nazis, terrorists).  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: No appeal to popularity (e.g., "Most Americans support...").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Implies sanctuary policies directly cause danger by releasing "criminal aliens," ignoring systemic complexities.  
12. **Obfuscation** – **No** – Explanation: Details are specific (locations, crimes, ages); no deliberate vagueness.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses quotes from ICE official Ricardo Wong to validate the operation’s purpose.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents ICE operations as the only solution to "improve public safety," ignoring alternatives.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Phrases like "uphold public safety" and "protect the nation" discourage scrutiny of ICE methods.  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: No irrelevant distractions; all examples relate to arrests.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy toward critics.  

---

**Verdict – 80%** – Explanation: The text employs multiple propaganda techniques to frame ICE operations as heroic and sanctuary policies as dangerous. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded terms ("criminal aliens," "reckless") and fear appeals (listing violent crimes) dominate the narrative.  
- **Repetition and oversimplification**: The repeated emphasis on "criminal aliens" and deportation status oversimplifies immigration issues, while causal oversimplification blames sanctuary policies for systemic risks.  
- **Authority and nationalism**: Quotes from ICE officials and flag-waving language ("protect the nation") lend artificial legitimacy.  
- **Suppressing nuance**: Black-and-white framing and thought-terminating clichés ("improve public safety") dismiss broader policy discussions.  
Though based on factual arrests, selective reporting (highlighting extreme cases) and systemic bias toward ICE’s mission confirm propaganda intent. The 80% likelihood reflects overt techniques outweighing neutral reporting elements.
