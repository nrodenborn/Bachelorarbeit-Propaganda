Based on the definitions provided and analysis of the text, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – Explanation: Uses derogatory labels like "Bergoglians" (imposing a cult-like faction), "wrecking-ball pontificate," and "Big Brother hit-squad" to attack Pope Francis and his supporters.  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Explanation: Repeats "autonomy" 46 times (e.g., "autonomy of life," "juridical autonomy") to emphasize Vatican control as a core grievance.  
3. **Slogans** – No – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL") are used; critiques are elaborated, not condensed into slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Explanation: Warns monasteries face dissolution like "patients under euthanasia laws," invoking fear of extinction (e.g., "quiet reign of terror," "chopping block for dissolution").  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Explanation: Questions Vatican credibility, e.g., "How do you know? Because we’re telling you it has?" mocking claims of post-Vatican II continuity.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Explanation: Minimizes Vatican norms as "not much more than a list of specific norms" (downplaying complexity), while exaggerating NHS policies as a "reign of terror."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – Explanation: No appeals to patriotism/national identity; focuses on Catholic tradition, not secular loyalty.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged terms like "wrecking-ball pontificate," "torpedo," and "Orwell in the dust" to vilify reforms.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – Explanation: Compares federations to "Vichy collaboration" and "Soviet attacks" on monasteries, invoking hated regimes.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Explanation: No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone supports this"); critiques are isolated to ideological dissent.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Explanation: Blames Vatican II solely for religious life’s "total statistical collapse," ignoring socioeconomic factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Explanation: Criticizes Vatican’s vague terms (e.g., "vitality"), but the text itself is explicit in its arguments.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Explanation: Cites documents (e.g., "Cor orans") for critique, not as validation; no authoritative endorsements.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Explanation: Presents "Catholic programme of Christ" vs. "Bergoglian programme" as irreconcilable opposites, ignoring nuance.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – Explanation: No phrases like "trust the plan"; invites critical analysis (e.g., questioning "usefulness").  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Explanation: Diverts to NHS euthanasia policies (e.g., "Mental Capacity Act")—irrelevant to monastic reforms—to evoke outrage.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Explanation: Attributes unproven motives to the Vatican, e.g., claiming federations have "material incentives" to suppress monasteries.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., "What about X?"); focuses on Vatican actions alone.

### Final Verdict  
**Verdict – 85% – Explanation**  
The text is highly likely to be propaganda due to its systematic use of emotional manipulation, distorted framing, and polemical techniques. Key indicators include:  
- **Loaded language and name-calling** (e.g., "Bergoglians," "wrecking-ball") to vilify opponents.  
- **Fear appeals** comparing monastery closures to euthanasia and historical persecution.  
- **Repetition** of "autonomy" to reinforce a narrative of oppressive control.  
- **Fallacious reasoning** (e.g., black-and-white dichotomies, causal oversimplification) to dismiss nuance.  
- **Straw men and reduction ad Hitlerum** to delegitimize reforms via false motives/Nazi/Soviet parallels.  
While grounded in real documents (e.g., "Cor orans"), the text selectively interprets facts to advance an ideological agenda, using emotive language to provoke aversion to Pope Francis’ policies. The 15% uncertainty arises from factual references to Vatican actions, but these are weaponized to serve propaganda goals.
