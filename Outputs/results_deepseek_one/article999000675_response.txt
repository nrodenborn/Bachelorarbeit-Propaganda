Here is the analysis of the propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

### Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "racist," "totalitarian," "domestic terrorist," and "criminal traitor" are insulting labels applied to Farrakhan.  
2. **Repetition** – No – No single phrase or idea is repeated excessively; the core message is consistent but not redundantly restated.  
3. **Slogans** – No – The text quotes Farrakhan's slogans ("Death to America," "Great Satan") but does not create its own brief, memorable phrase.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Portrays Farrakhan as a traitor assimilating with "avowed enemies," implying an existential threat to the U.S. ("Is this not treason of the first order?").  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions the credibility of Democrats (e.g., Keith Ellison) and U.S. policy: "why would Louis Farrakhan ever be allowed back," "despite the lies he tells."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates Farrakhan's influence by labeling him a "domestic terrorist" without evidence of terrorism; minimizes Democratic denials of ties.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to patriotism by framing Farrakhan's actions as betrayal of America and aligning him with enemies.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Uses emotionally charged terms like "avowed enemies," "treason," "plots," "criminal traitor" to evoke outrage.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis or Hitler-era ideologies.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Does not appeal to the popularity of an idea or group.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Reduces complex U.S.-Iran tensions to Farrakhan's actions and Democratic associations (e.g., ties to Ellison imply broader treason).  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Language is direct and unambiguous.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Cites sources (MEMRI, Algemeiner) for factual reporting but does not use them as moral/political authority.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents a false dichotomy: either Democrats denounce Farrakhan or are complicit in treason ("not being arrested for his ties").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to shut down critical analysis (e.g., "treason" is argued, not a cliché).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Shifts focus to Democrats (Ellison) and partisan blame, irrelevant to Farrakhan's actions in Iran.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Does not misrepresent an opposing argument.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Does not accuse critics of hypocrisy regarding their own actions.  

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is highly likely to be propaganda due to its systematic use of manipulative techniques to advance a partisan agenda. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language ("domestic terrorist," "Great Satan") and appeals to fear/patriotism dominate, aiming to provoke anger rather than inform.  
- **Ad Hominem Attacks**: Focuses on discrediting Farrakhan (and Democrats) via name-calling and exaggeration, not substantive policy critique.  
- **Partisan Framing**: Uses red herrings (e.g., Keith Ellison) and black/white fallacies to conflate Farrakhan’s actions with broader Democratic "treason," diverting attention from factual reporting.  
- **Selective Fact Use**: While some details are factual (e.g., Farrakhan’s statements in Iran), they are embedded in sensationalized accusations lacking context (e.g., no evidence for "domestic terrorist" label).  
- **Purpose**: Clearly seeks to vilify political opponents (Democrats) and stoke nationalism, not explore nuances of U.S.-Iran relations or free speech.  
The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the inclusion of verified quotes (e.g., Farrakhan’s "Death to America"), but these are weaponized to serve the propagandistic narrative.
