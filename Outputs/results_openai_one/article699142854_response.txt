Certainly! Below is the analysis of each propaganda technique according to your instructions, followed by the final verdict.

**1. Name calling – No –** There are no direct insulting labels attached to individuals or groups.  
**2. Repetition – No –** The text does not repeat the same phrase or message in a way that constitutes repetition as a propaganda technique.  
**3. Slogans – No –** There are no brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.  
**4. Appeal to fear – Yes –** The text emphasizes the threat of Iran’s nuclear program and aggression: “...remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.”  
**5. Doubt – Yes –** The text questions the credibility of Obama’s policy: “...the mendacious assumptions of Obama’s Iran policy – that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally...”  
**6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes –** The text exaggerates the threat posed by Iran: “...remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.”  
**7. Flag-Waving – Yes –** The text appeals to patriotism and US interests: “...no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass...”  
**8. Loaded Language – Yes –** The text uses emotionally charged language: “murderous regime,” “authoritarian theocrats,” “menace,” “mendacious assumptions.”  
**9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No –** There are no comparisons to Nazis or other universally hated groups.  
**10. Bandwagon – No –** The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea or suggest that everyone is or should be on board.  
**11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes –** The text suggests that changing policy or strategy alone can solve the complex Iran issue: “If the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.”  
**12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No –** The text is relatively clear in its arguments and does not use intentionally vague or obscure language.  
**13. Appeal to authority – Yes –** The text references Trump’s and Nikki Haley’s positions and statements as evidence for its arguments.  
**14. Black & white fallacy – Yes –** The text presents only two options: either confront Iran holistically or face a continued threat, without acknowledging other possibilities: “If they fail, the possibility Trump created will be lost, perhaps irrevocably.”  
**15. Thought-terminating clichés – No –** There are no phrases that serve to shut down debate or critical thought.  
**16. Red herring – Yes –** The discussion of Corker’s personal motives and the Democrats’ internal politics distracts from the main issue of Iran policy.  
**17. Straw men – Yes –** The text misrepresents Obama’s policy as based on “mendacious assumptions” that Iran is a responsible actor, which oversimplifies and misstates the actual policy rationale.  
**18. Whataboutism – No –** The text does not charge opponents with hypocrisy by pointing to their own faults.

### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 80% –**  
The text exhibits a significant number of propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, red herring, and straw man arguments. These techniques are used to shape the reader’s perception of US policy toward Iran, delegitimize previous approaches, and frame the current administration’s actions in a highly favorable light. While the article does provide some factual information and analysis, the frequent use of emotionally charged language, oversimplification of complex issues, and presentation of only two stark choices indicate a strong propagandistic intent. The likelihood that the text is propaganda is therefore high, at approximately 80%.
