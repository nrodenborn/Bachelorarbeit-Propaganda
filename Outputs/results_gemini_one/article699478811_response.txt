Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to describe Iran and its actions, such as “rogue regime,” “outlaw behavior,” and referring to the nuclear deal as “disastrous” and “loophole-ridden.”

Repetition – Yes – The idea that Iran is aggressive and a destabilizing force is repeated throughout the text, using phrases like “aggressive actions,” “aggressive, destabilizing force,” and “aggressive, destabilizing, and unlawful behavior.”

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear by comparing Iran to North Korea, stating, “When a rogue regime starts down the path of ballistic missiles, it tells us that we will soon have another North Korea on our hands.”

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal and the idea that it is not collaborating with North Korea with the rhetorical question: “Does anybody with a modicum of sense really believe that such collaboration between the two rogue nations is not going on today?”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the negative aspects of the Iran nuclear deal, calling it “disastrous” and “loophole-ridden,” and dismisses counterarguments as “absurd on its face.”

Flag-Waving – No – While the text discusses U.S. national interests and forces, it does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity to persuade the audience.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader’s opinion, such as “disastrous nuclear deal,” “Iran’s outlaw behavior,” and “Iran’s destructive conduct.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to the Nazis to discredit them.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is correct because it is popular. In fact, it argues against the position of U.S. allies and former officials.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple cause-and-effect relationship where the JCPOA directly funded all of Iran’s subsequent “exploits,” as stated here: “With the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions making available billions of dollars to Iran’s leaders to further finance the IRGC’s exploits...”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its arguments and accusations; it does not use intentionally vague or obscure language.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on the statements of U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley and a report from The Heritage Foundation to support its claims against Iran.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy in Nikki Haley’s quoted statement: “Iran must be judged in totality of its aggressive, destabilizing, and unlawful behavior. To do otherwise would be foolish.” This frames the issue as having only one correct approach and one foolish one.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase “This argument is absurd on its face” to dismiss the concerns of European allies and former Secretaries of State without further discussion, discouraging critical thought about their position.

Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central argument about Iran and the nuclear deal. The introduction of North Korea is used as a direct comparison, not as an irrelevant distraction.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the argument of the JCPOA’s proponents. It reframes their concern about U.S. credibility as simply wanting to “kick the can down the road,” which is a weaker argument that is easier to attack.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy. The comparison to North Korea is used to argue for consistent application of a standard, not to evade a critique.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It exhibits a significant number of propaganda techniques (12 out of 18) woven together to construct a one-sided and emotionally charged narrative. The piece does not aim for a balanced presentation of a complex geopolitical issue; instead, it has a clear agenda: to demonize the Iranian regime and the JCPOA (the Obama-era nuclear deal) while validating the Trump administration's confrontational stance.

The argument is built on a foundation of loaded language ("rogue regime," "disastrous deal," "outlaw behavior") and name-calling, which immediately frames Iran and the previous administration's policy as negative. It heavily employs appeal to fear, most notably by repeatedly drawing a parallel to North Korea to evoke the specter of nuclear war. The author uses appeals to authority (Nikki Haley, The Heritage Foundation) to lend credibility to their viewpoint, while simultaneously dismissing opposing authorities and arguments as "absurd" (thought-terminating cliché) or misrepresenting them to be easily defeated (straw man).

Furthermore, the text simplifies complex issues, such as attributing Iran's regional activities solely to the cash influx from the JCPOA (causal oversimplification) and presenting the situation as a simple choice between total condemnation and being "foolish" (black & white fallacy). While the article uses factual elements, such as quoting officials and reporting on events, these facts are selected and framed exclusively to support its predetermined conclusion, which is the essence of propaganda.
