1. Name calling – No – The text reports that President Trump used the phrase "total witch hunt," but the article itself does not use name-calling to attack a subject. It is quoting a figure involved in the story.
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat a specific message to persuade the audience. It presents a variety of facts and developments related to the Mueller report.
3. Slogans – No – The text quotes the phrase "total witch hunt," which could be considered a slogan, but it is attributed to President Trump. The article itself does not create or use its own slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear in the reader. It reports on the events and statements factually.
5. Doubt – No – The text reports on existing uncertainties and different perspectives but does not actively try to cast doubt on the credibility of any person or entity.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text uses descriptive language like "transfixed the nation," but this reflects the high public interest in the event and is not a propagandistic exaggeration. It primarily sticks to factual reporting.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism. It reports on the investigation into foreign meddling in a U.S. election, but does so from a factual, not a nationalistic, standpoint.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is written clearly and aims to inform the reader, not confuse them. It explains the situation and the potential next steps.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text cites authorities like the Attorney General and members of Congress to report their statements and actions, which is standard journalistic sourcing. It does not use their authority as the sole evidence to prove a contested point or to persuade the audience.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present a false dichotomy. It discusses multiple possibilities, such as the potential for two different versions of the report being released.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to end discussion; it provides detailed information intended to inform the reader.
16. Red herring – No – All the information presented, including details of specific indictments and other investigations, is directly relevant to the scope and consequences of the Mueller probe.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not engage in whataboutism or accuse any party of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 5% – The text is a news report, not a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the public about the conclusion of the Mueller investigation, not to persuade the audience to adopt a particular viewpoint. The article maintains a neutral tone, attributes statements and opinions to their sources (e.g., Barr, Schiff, Trump), and presents factual details about the investigation's scope, indictments, and related ongoing probes. It actively avoids all the listed propaganda techniques. The only reason the likelihood is not 0% is that any journalistic piece involves editorial choices about which facts to include or emphasize, which can introduce a subtle bias. However, based on the provided definitions, this text is a clear example of informational journalism, which is the antithesis of propaganda. It even reports on the use of a propaganda technique by a political figure ("total witch hunt") rather than using the technique itself.
