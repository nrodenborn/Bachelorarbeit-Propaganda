Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents as “BDS agitators,” “BDS provocateurs,” a “rancid character,” and “bigoted BDS provocateurs.”
Repetition – Yes – The idea that the BDS movement is a “campaign of hate” and anti-Semitic is repeated throughout the text using various phrasings like “pernicious campaign of hate,” “campaign of hate laced with blatant anti-Semitic overtones,” and “manifestly anti-Semitic campaign.”
Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to rally support for its own cause.
Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear by comparing the situation to a dark historical period: “An enlightened, progressive school was suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws.”
Doubt – Yes – The author casts doubt on the effectiveness of the university’s investigation: “Judging by past ‘investigations’ conducted by other schools... I am not optimistic.”
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The title itself, “An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University,” exaggerates the events by using the word “purge,” which is typically associated with mass killings or removals by authoritarian regimes.
Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to identity by framing the events as an attack on a specific group: “Democratize SSMU shamefully highlighted Lew’s ethnicity as a reason for his removal.”
Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as “pernicious campaign of hate,” “latest outrage,” “toxic environment,” “malevolent BDS campaign,” and “rancid character.”
Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text explicitly compares the actions of the BDS activists to Nazis: “An enlightened, progressive school was suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws.”
Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests a growing consensus against the BDS activists to encourage the reader to join in: “The vitriolic BDS campaign immediately sparked outrage among watchdog groups and politicians prompting McGill principal, Suzanne Fortier, to announce that the school would be conducting an investigation into the matter.”
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes a complex issue to a single cause: “The toxic environment is due almost exclusively to an active and vocal presence of BDS agitators on campus.”
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and specific in its accusations, not vague or intentionally confusing.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites the SSMU president to support the central claim: “Even SSMU president, Muna Tojiboeva, voiced support for Lew and expressed the belief that antisemitism played a key role in the ousting the three board members.”
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a conflict between two opposing sides: the pro-Israel/Jewish students who are victims, and the “bigoted BDS provocateurs” who are aggressors, leaving no room for any nuanced positions.
Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases designed to shut down discussion; rather, it aims to provoke a strong reaction.
Red herring – Yes – The lengthy aside about Igor Sadikov, who had already resigned from the SSMU board, serves to further demonize the BDS movement but distracts from the central event being discussed: the vote to remove Lew and the other two directors.
Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the name of the “Democratize SSMU” movement by assigning it a sinister motive that it may not have publicly stated: “But Democratize SSMU was anything but democratic. Its raison d'être was to seek the removal of Jewish and anti-BDS students from SSMU’s Board of Directors...”
Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to discredit its opponents by accusing them of hypocrisy or pointing to other unrelated wrongdoings.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative view of the BDS movement and its activists. This is achieved through the heavy and combined use of numerous propaganda techniques.

The piece relies extensively on Loaded Language (“pernicious,” “malevolent,” “rancid”) and Name Calling (“agitators,” “provocateurs,” “bigots”) to emotionally color the opponents as unequivocally evil. It employs a stark Black & White Fallacy, presenting a world with no nuance: one is either a victimized pro-Israel student or a hateful anti-Semite.

Crucially, it uses two of the most powerful emotional tactics: Appeal to Fear and Reduction ad Hitlerum, by directly comparing the actions of university students to “Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws.” This is a severe exaggeration designed to provoke maximum outrage and shut down rational consideration. The argument is further bolstered by Causal Oversimplification, blaming a “toxic environment” solely on one group, and appealing to both identity (Flag-Waving) and authority (citing the SSMU president) to solidify its case. While based on a real event, the framing, word choice, and argumentative structure are all classic hallmarks of propaganda meant to inflame opinion rather than foster understanding.
