Name calling – Yes – The title of the article itself, “The US Is Blatantly Telling Lies,” attacks the US government with an insulting label.

Repetition – No – The text builds an argument with various points rather than repeating the same phrase or sentence multiple times.

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to promote its own ideas. It critiques a phrase used by Nikki Haley, but does not employ slogans itself.

Appeal to fear – No – The text critiques Nikki Haley’s use of an appeal to fear (“If we do nothing about the missiles fired at Saudi Arabia, we will not be able to stop the violence,”) but does not use this technique itself to persuade the reader.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is structured to cast doubt on the credibility of the U.S. government’s claims. For example: “Did she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remarks, or fail to read the entire UN report? The world may never know.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author uses exaggeration in their own descriptions to create a negative impression, such as calling Nikki Haley’s speech a “grandiose speech” and an “infamous performance.”

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism; in fact, it is highly critical of the actions of the U.S. government.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader’s perception, such as “demonize,” “grandiose speech,” “infamous performance,” “hypocritical,” and “schizophrenic approach.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare the U.S. government or its officials to Nazis or other universally hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. It cites specific experts and reports to support its claims.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The article argues against a causal oversimplification (that Iran is solely responsible) by presenting a more complex picture involving multiple actors and older technology.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text aims for clarity by citing specific reports and expert analysis to debunk the U.S. claims. It accuses Haley of being misleading, but is not vague itself.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text relies heavily on the testimony of experts to support its argument, such as “former inspector Scott Ritter,” “Common Dream’s Reza Marashi,” and a “panel of U.N. experts.”

Black & white fallacy – No – The text argues against a black-and-white view of the conflict by introducing nuance and evidence that complicates the U.S. government’s narrative.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The article is designed to encourage critical thought and discussion about the U.S. claims, not to shut it down with clichés.

Red herring – No – While the text brings up other U.S. foreign policy actions, it does so to build a case for hypocrisy, not to distract from the central argument about the missiles in Yemen.

Straw men – No – The text directly addresses and attempts to refute the specific claims made by Nikki Haley, rather than misrepresenting her argument.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text directly accuses the U.S. of hypocrisy by deflecting to other issues: “Even if Iran were arming the Houthis, Haley’s hypocritical anti-Iran rhetoric doesn’t excuse the U.S. for continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed ISIS...”

***

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally, but to persuade the reader that the U.S. government's position on Iran is based on lies and hypocrisy. It achieves this by selectively presenting evidence that supports its thesis while using multiple propaganda techniques. The piece opens with aggressive Name Calling in its title, frames the entire issue by casting Doubt on U.S. officials, and uses emotionally Loaded Language ("demonize," "infamous," "schizophrenic") throughout to shape the reader's opinion. It heavily relies on Appeal to Authority (citing Ritter and Marashi) to validate its own claims and employs Whataboutism to charge the U.S. with hypocrisy regarding its foreign policy in other areas. The combination of these techniques creates a powerful, one-sided argument designed to manipulate the reader's perception rather than encourage a balanced understanding of the complex geopolitical situation.
