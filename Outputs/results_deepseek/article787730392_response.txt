Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – The headline labels the defendants as "New Mexico Jihadis", an insulting and inflammatory term implying violent extremism based on religion.
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The core phrase "If these were white Christians..." (or variations like "If they were white Christians...") is repeated multiple times: in the headline, the editor's note, and within Thomas Clark's quoted arguments.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – The phrase "No one would bat an eye" serves as a brief, memorable slogan encapsulating the main argument of differential treatment. It's used in the headline and quoted twice in Clark's argument.
4.  **Appeal to fear – No** – The text argues against perceived unfair prosecution; it does not primarily attempt to instill fear about alternatives to support an idea.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – The defense attorney (Clark) and the editor's note cast doubt on the motivations behind the charges, suggesting they stem from racial/religious prejudice ("racial and religious prejudice against his Muslim client", "they look different and they worship differently") rather than evidence of criminal activity.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – The core argument minimizes the alleged crimes (conspiracy for violent attacks, firearms violations, child neglect leading to death) by claiming identical actions by white Christians would be ignored ("no one would care", "no one would bat an eye", "not a big deal", "of no consequence"). This significantly downplays the severity of the allegations.
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – While the Second Amendment and freedom of religion are mentioned, they are used contextually to argue differential treatment, not as a primary appeal to patriotism or national identity itself.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Numerous emotionally charged terms are used: "Jihadis" (headline), "violent attacks", "malnourished children", "squalid conditions", "look different", "worship differently", "bat an eye". These appeal to emotions (fear, disgust, sympathy, outrage) and stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – The text does not attempt to disapprove of an idea by linking it to a universally despised group like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – The text does not primarily argue that an idea should be accepted because it's popular. It argues that certain actions *would be ignored* if done by a popular group (white Christians), which is different.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – The text oversimplifies the complex situation (serious criminal charges involving conspiracy, weapons, and child neglect/death) by attributing the prosecution primarily or solely to racial and religious bias ("they look different and they worship differently from the rest of us").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is relatively direct in its claims and arguments. The core message about differential treatment is stated repeatedly and clearly.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – The arguments rely heavily on the statements of the defense attorney, Thomas Clark, presented as an authoritative figure on the motivations behind the prosecution. The editor's note also functions as an appeal to the editor's authority/perspective.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – The text presents a stark dichotomy: either the charges are solely due to racial/religious prejudice *or* the actions are perfectly legal/normal (implied by "no one would bat an eye," "not a big deal," "freedom of religion," "Second Amendment right"). It ignores the possibility that the actions themselves, regardless of the perpetrators' identity, constitute serious crimes justifying prosecution.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Phrases like "No one would bat an eye," "not a big deal," "of no consequence," and appeals to constitutional rights ("Second Amendment right," "freedom of religion") are used to shut down critical examination of the specific, severe allegations (conspiracy for violent attacks, child neglect leading to death) by framing them as non-issues for a different group.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – The embedded poll ("Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?") and the associated text/prompts ("take our poll", "Completing this poll grants you access...", "Privacy Policy and Terms of Use") are completely irrelevant to the story about the New Mexico compound case. They serve only to distract and capture user data.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – The defense attorney (Clark) refutes arguments that were not the primary basis of the prosecution. He frames the prosecution as being about Muslims owning guns ("If these were white people of a Christian faith who owned guns, that’s not a big deal") and practicing their religion/faith healing ("faith healing is of no consequence"), while ignoring the core charges of *conspiracy to commit violent attacks* and firearms violations *related to that conspiracy*, and severe child neglect. The prosecution's actual focus (violent conspiracy and associated crimes) is replaced with a weaker argument (mere gun ownership/religious practice).
18. **Whataboutism – Yes** – The entire core argument ("If these were white Christians...") is classic whataboutism. It charges the prosecution/justice system/society with hypocrisy by diverting attention from the defendants' alleged crimes to the perceived different treatment of white Christians, implying the charges are invalid due to this alleged double standard.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is not to neutrally inform but to promote a specific narrative: that the defendants are victims of severe religious and racial discrimination, while simultaneously downplaying the gravity of the charges against them (conspiracy for violent attacks, child neglect resulting in death, firearms violations). Techniques like Name Calling ("Jihadis"), Repetition & Slogans ("If these were white Christians... No one would bat an eye"), Loaded Language, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization (of the crimes), Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-Terminating Clichés, Straw Men, and Whataboutism are all employed to frame the story this way. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant Red Herring (the Nikki Haley poll) further demonstrates an intent to manipulate or distract the audience. While based on a real event and containing factual reporting elements (e.g., the judge's ruling, charges), the selection, framing, commentary (headline, editor's note, Clark's quotes presented uncritically), and embedded distractions overwhelmingly serve a propagandistic purpose of shaping perception rather than providing balanced information.
