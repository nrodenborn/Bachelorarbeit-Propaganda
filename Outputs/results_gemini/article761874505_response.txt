1. Name calling – No – The text reports on a lawsuit against specific individuals (Obama, Comey) but does not use insulting labels to attack them.

2. Repetition – Yes – The comparison between Saucier's punishment and Hillary Clinton's lack of prosecution is stated multiple times to reinforce the idea of a double standard. For example: "they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton. Hillary is still walking free." and later, "But Hillary Clinton is running around free, to this day."

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable, and repeated phrases to encapsulate an idea.

4. Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses on alleged past injustice and hypocrisy rather than instilling fear about a future threat or alternative.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire premise of the article is to cast doubt on the fairness and credibility of the Obama administration, the DOJ, and the FBI by suggesting their actions were politically motivated and hypocritical. For example: "his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton’s emails."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes Saucier's actions ("he only wanted service mementos") while exaggerating the consequences and the alleged motive ("The government actively destroyed his life").

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text identifies the central figure as a "former Navy sailor" who served on a submarine, appealing to patriotism and the image of a wronged serviceman.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the reader, such as "lashed out," "scandal," "actively destroyed his life," and describing Saucier as being "burnt about, with good reason."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other groups widely hated by the audience.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that the reader should agree with Saucier's position because it is popular.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for Saucier's prosecution: it was a political move to counter the Clinton email scandal. For example: "They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its claims and accusations, naming specific individuals and events rather than using vague language.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article repeatedly cites "Fox News" as the source of the information, using the perceived authority of a news organization to lend credibility to the narrative. For example: "According to Fox News, Saucier argues that..."

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text creates a false equivalence by relentlessly comparing Saucier's case to Hillary Clinton's, presenting them as two sides of the same coin that should have been treated identically, while ignoring the vast legal and contextual differences between them.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down debate.

16. Red herring – Yes – The constant focus on Hillary Clinton is a red herring. It distracts from the legal merits of Saucier's own admitted crime by shifting the argument to a different, more politically charged issue.

17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent an opponent's argument in order to refute it. It attacks the perceived actions and double standards of the officials directly.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – This is the central technique used. The argument consistently deflects from Saucier's actions by charging hypocrisy and asking, "What about Hillary Clinton?" For example: "They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal... but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton."

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it reports on a real event (a lawsuit being filed), its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific political viewpoint. It does this by employing a significant number of propaganda techniques, including whataboutism, red herrings, loaded language, and causal oversimplification. The narrative is extremely one-sided, framing Saucier as a sympathetic victim of a corrupt political system. The final paragraph abandons any pretense of objective reporting and becomes pure editorializing, explicitly validating Saucier's anger ("with good reason") and using exaggerated, emotional language ("The government actively destroyed his life"). The piece is structured to generate outrage against political opponents (Obama, Comey, Clinton) and sympathy for an individual pardoned by a political ally (Trump), which is a hallmark of propaganda.
