### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Immigrant displacement" is used as an insulting label to frame immigration as inherently harmful to American workers.  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The term "displacement" is repeated 6 times, reinforcing the narrative of immigrants harming native-born workers.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: "America First" and "Americans First" are used as memorable phrases to simplify complex policy goals.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Warns that without legislation (e.g., a border wall), immigrants will dominate the population ("the term 'native born' will refer to a minuscule fraction").  
5. **Doubt** – **No** – Explanation: No explicit questioning of credibility; focuses on data interpretation.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Minimizes Trump’s role in job gains ("Trump has not even begun to repair the damage done by eight years of Obama") while exaggerating immigrant growth ("portends a doubling in 22 years").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to patriotism with phrases like "secure the fruits of the current economic expansion for Americans" and "America First."  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged terms like "shocking surge," "damage done by Obama," "irreversible winter," and "Operation Wetback."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No Nazi/Vichy comparisons or similar references.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: No appeal to popularity; relies on data, not peer pressure.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Blames immigration as the primary cause of native-born job struggles ("immigrant displacement of American workers"), ignoring economic complexities.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: Data is presented concretely (though selectively); no deliberate vagueness.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: Cites BLS data but no authoritative figures endorsing the narrative.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents legislation (border wall, moratorium) as the only solution to "secure fruits" for Americans, ignoring alternatives.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Cannot be jawboned away" shuts down debate, implying only extreme policies work.  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: Stays focused on immigration/jobs; no irrelevant distractions.

### Verdict – 85% – Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Selective Data Use**: While citing BLS statistics, it omits context (e.g., economic benefits of immigration, demographic nuances) to exclusively frame immigrants as job-stealers.  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language ("shocking surge," "Operation Wetback") and fear appeals (demographic "doubling") stoke nativist anxieties.  
3. **Oversimplification**: Reduces labor market dynamics to "immigrant vs. native-born" competition, ignoring factors like automation, education, or economic cycles.  
4. **Political Agenda**: Explicitly advocates for extreme policies (border wall, moratorium, "self-deporting") using "displacement" rhetoric.  
5. **Technique Density**: Employs 8/18 propaganda methods (Name Calling, Repetition, Slogans, Fear, Exaggeration, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Black & White Fallacy).  
The veneer of data analysis masks a deliberate effort to vilify immigrants and promote restrictive policies, aligning with nativist ideology rather than objective reporting.
