Verdict – 80% – While this text reports on a factual event (an arrest), it is constructed in a way that strongly suggests a propagandistic motive. The primary purpose is not simply to inform but to persuade the audience of a particular viewpoint. This is achieved by prioritizing the subject's gang affiliation over the actual offense. The headline immediately frames the individual as a "Gang Member," not as someone arrested for an immigration violation. The use of Loaded Language ("notorious for extreme violence and bloodshed") and the Appeal to Fear are central to the text's effect, linking an individual with no US criminal record to the worst actions of a gang. This exaggerates the immediate threat he poses. The entire narrative is presented under the Appeal to Authority of the Border Patrol, lending it credibility. By focusing on the most frightening aspects of the individual's background, the press release serves to justify the actions and importance of the Border Patrol, promoting a narrative that the border is dangerous and that the agency is essential for protecting the public. The selective framing and emotional manipulation are hallmarks of propaganda.
