1. Name calling – No – The text uses descriptive terms like "paedophile priest," which describes a criminal action, rather than using it as a simple insult to attack a subject.

3. Slogans – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to rally support.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The article reports on past events and does not attempt to instill fear about future possibilities.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article uses the testimony of credible figures to support its claims and challenge the Pope's statements. Example: "Members of the Pope's own Commission for the Protection of Minors... told the Associated Press they hand-delivered the letter to Francis's top adviser on sex abuse, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, in April 2015."

16. Red herring – No – All information presented is relevant to the central topic of the alleged cover-up.

Verdict – 40% – The text is a piece of investigative journalism from a major news outlet, and its primary purpose is to inform the public by presenting evidence that contradicts an official narrative. In this respect, it is not propaganda. However, it uses a specific framing and several techniques (Doubt, Loaded Language, Appeal to authority) that are also characteristic of propaganda to build a persuasive case and guide the reader to a specific conclusion—namely, that the Pope was not being truthful. The selection of emotionally charged words and the focus on authoritative sources who contradict the Pope are deliberate choices designed to influence the audience's perception. While based on factual reporting, this strong persuasive angle gives it propagandistic qualities.
