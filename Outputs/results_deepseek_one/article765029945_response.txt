Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "shameless Zionists" (attacking those who make certain comparisons), "stupid" (describing Hayden's analogy), "thoughtless" (describing Hayden's tweet).
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – "Holocaust" is repeated multiple times, especially in the opening "rules". "Nazi" and variations are also repeated.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "Children are being used as human shields" is a brief, memorable, and emotionally charged phrase.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "Children are being used as human shields in a campaign to end national security forever" instills fear about the consequences of opposing the immigration policies.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "It's particularly stupid of Michael Hayden to make that analogy because during the Bush years, the agencies he ran were compared to Nazi Germany. Repeatedly. You might think that would have cured him of facile Nazi analogies. But instead it seems to have whetted his appetite for making them." Questions Hayden's judgment and credibility based on past events.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – "end national security forever" is a clear exaggeration of the potential consequences of opposing the immigration enforcement policies.
7.  **Flag-Waving – Implied** – The defense of US immigration enforcement ("Every country arrests people. Just about every country splits up families...") and "national security" appeals to patriotism/national identity, though not as overtly as some examples.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "shameless Zionists", "stupid", "thoughtless", "facile Nazi analogies", "whetted his appetite", "human shields", "campaign to end national security forever" all use emotionally charged words and connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes (Core Argument)** – The *entire article* accuses Hayden (and others) of inappropriately using Nazi/Holocaust comparisons ("Reduction ad Hitlerum" against Hayden's position). It also uses this technique itself: "The Muslim Brotherhood's leaders praising Hitler, calling for another Holocaust and killing Jews is nothing like the Holocaust." (disapproving of MB by linking them to Hitler/Holocaust).
10. **Bandwagon – No** – No explicit appeal to the popularity of the author's viewpoint.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – No** – While simplifying arguments, no specific complex event is given a single, simple cause here.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes** – "The media has 2 very simple rules for Holocaust analogies." It's unclear who defines these "rules" or if they are universally applied by "the media," creating vagueness about the claim's basis.
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – No authority is cited to support the author's claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents the debate as only two options: supporting strict immigration enforcement (portrayed as normal and necessary) or wanting "open borders" (portrayed as using children as shields to end national security). "The attacks here are motivated by a desire for open borders."
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "That's the really relevant part." This dismisses Hayden's comparison point (separation) and shuts down further consideration of similarities/differences by declaring the *only* relevant factor is extermination.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – Introducing the Muslim Brotherhood's views on Hitler and the Holocaust ("The Muslim Brotherhood's leaders praising Hitler... is nothing like the Holocaust.") is irrelevant to the critique of Hayden's comparison of US policy to Nazi Germany. It distracts by bringing in a different group's unrelated actions/views.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – "Hayden's thoughtless tweet can just as easily be used to delegitimize any and all law enforcement." Hayden criticized a *specific policy* (family separation under Trump). The author reframes this as an attack on *all* law enforcement, a much broader and easier target to dismiss.
18. **Whataboutism – Yes** – "It's particularly stupid of Michael Hayden to make that analogy because during the Bush years, the agencies he ran were compared to Nazi Germany. Repeatedly." This charges Hayden with hypocrisy (his agencies were *also* compared to Nazis) rather than directly engaging with the substance of his criticism about the *current* policy.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a very high density of propaganda techniques. Its core argument relies heavily on **Reduction ad Hitlerum** to dismiss criticism by labeling it as inappropriate Holocaust comparison. It employs **Name Calling** ("shameless Zionists," "stupid," "thoughtless"), **Loaded Language** throughout, and **Appeal to Fear** ("end national security forever"). It distracts with **Red Herring** (Muslim Brotherhood), misrepresents the opponent's argument with **Straw Men** (delegitimizing *all* law enforcement), presents a **Black & White Fallacy** (enforcement vs. open borders ending security), uses **Thought-Terminating Clichés** ("That's the really relevant part"), engages in **Whataboutism** (Bush-era comparisons), and employs **Repetition** (Holocaust/Nazi), **Exaggeration** ("end national security forever"), **Doubt** (on Hayden's judgment), **Obfuscation** ("media rules"), and **Slogans** ("human shields"). The primary purpose is not balanced analysis but to discredit criticism of US immigration policy by aggressively attacking the critic and framing the debate in emotionally charged, manipulative terms, making it highly likely to be propaganda.
