Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and red herring. These techniques are used to undermine the credibility of Kavanaugh's accuser and her lawyer by focusing on their associations and funding sources rather than addressing the substance of the allegations. The presence of these techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is intended to sway public opinion through propaganda.
