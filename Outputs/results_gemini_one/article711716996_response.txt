1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses insulting labels for Judge Patti Saris, such as "Kritarch Patti Saris," and for ethnic groups, such as "the rather dull Indonesians" and "a dull lot." It also refers to the immigrants as "illegal aliens."

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the claim about the average Indonesian IQ being 87 multiple times to reinforce a point. For example, "87 is the average Indonesian IQ" and later, "Remember, an 87 IQ is just about retarded."

3. Slogans – Yes – The text concludes by referencing a well-known political slogan: "...build the wall, and deport illegals here."

4. Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses more on generating anger, outrage, and contempt towards the judge and the immigrants rather than instilling fear in the reader about a potential negative outcome.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text is a sustained effort to cast doubt on the competence and legitimacy of Judge Saris. For example: "Saris appears to be making up immigration law and procedure on the fly, as her order appears to not understand either the EOIR process or immigration law."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the persecution in Indonesia, calling it "limited in time and duration," while exaggerating the judge's actions, stating she has "gone full rogue."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the judge's actions as an attack on "the immigration laws of the United States" and calling for the Trump Administration to protect "American immigration policy."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words intended to influence the reader, such as "pogrom," "dull lot," "credulous 'judges'," "Obama Regime," and "inglorious end."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Nazis or associated groups.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. It asserts its position as being legally and factually correct, regardless of popularity.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simplistic reason for a complex situation, stating that Indonesia needs a "high IQ elite to run the country," first the Dutch and now the Chinese, as the sole reason for its stability.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – While the author accuses the judge of being vague, the author's own text is direct and clear in its attacks and assertions, not intentionally obscure.

13. Appeal to authority – No – The text cites a judge and a Reuters article only to attack and discredit them, not to use their authority as evidence to support its own claims.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between two extremes: either upholding "the immigration laws of the United States" (by deporting the immigrants) or allowing a "rogue" judge to make up her own laws.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase "elections have consequences" to shut down any debate about the change in immigration policy, implying the matter is settled by the election's outcome.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the topic of IQ scores, which is irrelevant to the legal merits of an asylum case, to distract the reader and create prejudice against the immigrants and their country of origin.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents Judge Saris's temporary order for a case review as a final decision to let immigrants stay forever: "Basically Saris wants these illegals to never leave."

18. Whataboutism – No – The text attacks its targets directly and does not attempt to deflect criticism by pointing out the hypocrisy of another party.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. It employs a very high density of propaganda techniques to promote a specific, highly biased political viewpoint. Instead of presenting a reasoned argument based on legal principles, it relies on emotional manipulation. The piece is characterized by constant **Name-calling** ("Kritarch," "dull lot"), the use of **Loaded Language** ("Obama Regime," "full rogue"), and the creation of a **Straw Man** by misrepresenting a judge's temporary procedural order as a permanent decision to subvert the law. It uses a **Red Herring** (the lengthy and irrelevant discussion of IQ scores) to create prejudice and distract from the actual legal issues. The argument is framed as a **Black & White Fallacy** where one must either support the author's view of immigration law or support a rogue judiciary. The sheer number and blatant application of these techniques demonstrate that the author's primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the audience to adopt a position of anger and hostility towards a federal judge, a group of immigrants, and the established legal process.
