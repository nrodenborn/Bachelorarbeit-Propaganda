1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Louis Farrakhan as a “racist,” “totalitarian,” “domestic terrorist,” and “criminal traitor.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The phrases “Death to America” and “Great Satan” are repeated multiple times to emphasize the point. The connection between Farrakhan and the Democratic party is also mentioned at the beginning and end of the text.
3. Slogans – No – While the text reports on slogans used by others (e.g., “Death to America”), it does not create or use its own brief, memorable phrase to advance its own message.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text labels Farrakhan a “domestic terrorist” who “assimilates with avowed enemies of the US,” which is intended to create fear and alarm about national security.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of a politician by stating, “despite the lies he tells to try and distance himself from Farrakhan for votes.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the situation by asking why Democrats like Keith Ellison are not “being arrested for his ties to this criminal traitor,” which is an extreme interpretation of the events.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by focusing on Farrakhan’s anti-American chants (“Death to America!”) and his association with “avowed enemies of the US,” framing the issue as one of national loyalty versus treason.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like “racist,” “totalitarian,” “criminal traitor,” and “Great Satan” to evoke a strong negative reaction from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler specifically, the technique’s principle of disapproving of something by association with a hated group is used. The text attempts to discredit Democrats by repeatedly associating them with Louis Farrakhan, who is portrayed as an enemy of the state (“assimilates with avowed enemies of the US”).
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular or that the reader should agree because many others do.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex issue of political associations by suggesting that because some Democrats have ties to Farrakhan, they are therefore traitors who should be arrested. This ignores the nuances of political relationships and legal definitions of treason.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites other sources like “Algemeiner reported,” “H/T Gateway Pundit,” and MEMRI to lend credibility to its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy where politicians are either completely distanced from Farrakhan or they are traitors who approve of him, as seen in “And Ellison isn’t the only Democrat who approves of Farrakhan!” This ignores any possibility of nuanced relationships or condemnations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The rhetorical question, “Is this not treason of the first order?” is used to shut down discussion and assert a conclusion without providing a nuanced legal argument, discouraging critical thought on the matter.
16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on its goal of linking Louis Farrakhan to the Democratic party and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract from this main point.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text builds a straw man by implying that Democrats broadly approve of Farrakhan’s actions (“And Ellison isn’t the only Democrat who approves of Farrakhan!”), an argument that is not being made by the Democratic party itself. It then attacks this fabricated position.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by pointing out the hypocrisy of an opponent; instead, it makes direct accusations.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly a piece of propaganda. While it is based on a factual event (Louis Farrakhan’s trip to Iran and his statements), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of the Democratic party. It achieves this by employing a vast number of propaganda techniques. The piece uses highly emotional and loaded language (Name calling, Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear) to create an immediate negative association. It then uses guilt by association (a form of Reduction ad Hitlerum) to transfer these negative feelings from Farrakhan to Democrats. The argument is built on logical fallacies, including a Straw Man (implying Democrats approve of Farrakhan's extremism), Causal Oversimplification (ties = treason), and a Black & White Fallacy (you are either against him or a traitor). The rhetorical questions and exaggerated claims ("being arrested for his ties") are designed to provoke an emotional response rather than critical thought. An objective news report would state the facts of Farrakhan's visit and might note his past associations, but it would not use the event to label an entire political group as treasonous. The text's clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion through these techniques, rather than present a balanced account, confirms its nature as propaganda.
