Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Stealth proselytizing" (used to describe the alleged teaching about Islam), "infidels" (attributed to the video content, used negatively). Also implied in framing multiculturalism as self-hating.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: Multiple, repeated examples of schools allegedly promoting Islam (WV, NJ, MA, GA, TN) are used to reinforce the central claim.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: The title itself, "The Islamization of the Public Schools," acts as a brief, memorable phrase framing the entire argument.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Warns of Islam "whitewashing its violent history and intolerant doctrines," creating a "vacuum" Muslims are "eager to fill," and implies Islamic law could be implemented. Suggests multiculturalism leads to loss of one's own culture.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Questions educators' ability to think critically due to the "imperative to be ‘tolerant’", casting doubt on their judgment and the neutrality of the curriculum.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggeration: "indefatigably committed to multiculturalism," claims presentations "frequently cross the line," "stealth proselytizing is nationwide." Minimization: Downplays counter-arguments (e.g., administrators' defenses like "equitable treatment" are dismissed).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Implicit appeal to protect American/Western culture and values (Christianity, Judaism) against perceived encroachment by Islam facilitated by multiculturalism.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Pervasive use of emotionally charged negative terms: "whitewashes," "violent history," "intolerant doctrines," "proselytizing," "infidels," "gruesome detail," "slaughtering," "indoctrinate," "encroachments," "self-hatred," "vacuum." Positive terms for Western values are implied.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No direct comparisons to Nazis or other universally hated groups are made in the text.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Explanation: "This stealth proselytizing is nationwide," and the quote "We are teaching the same stuff that everyone else is teaching" (Kim Embry) imply this is a widespread, accepted practice the reader should be concerned about.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Attributes the alleged Islamic bias primarily and simply to multiculturalism ("Multiculturalism, after all, amounts to respect for every culture except one’s own") and Saudi funding, ignoring other potential complex factors in curriculum design.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses vague, non-quantifiable terms: "all too many public schools," "increasingly set aside," "frequently cross the line," "much less time," "less extensive," "stealth proselytizing is nationwide." Avoids precise evidence of scale or frequency.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Cites quotes from parents (Penkoski, Hilsenrath, King, Ellis, Porterfield), administrators (Branch, Embry, Marczak), and organizations (Judicial Watch, Citizens for National Security) to validate claims and concerns, even when contradictory.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents multiculturalism as requiring the abandonment of one's own culture ("respect for every culture except one’s own"). Frames the issue as either teaching "facts" or teaching "the religion as fact," ignoring nuanced middle ground. Implies educators are either critically evaluating or blindly tolerant.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: While loaded language is used, no specific phrases like "it is what it is" or "that's just the way it is" are used explicitly to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: The embedded poll ("Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?") is completely irrelevant to the topic of Islam in schools and serves only to distract or inflame partisan sentiment.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: Attributes arguments to proponents that are not presented: "Certainly, those who are furthering the Islamization... would say that they are doing it all for tolerance, pluralism, and multiculturalism. Unfortunately, in the end, it amounts to the same thing." This misrepresents and oversimplifies their stated goals (like global education) to easily refute them.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: While it compares treatment of Islam to Christianity/Judaism, the primary focus is on criticizing the *current* teaching about Islam, not charging proponents with hypocrisy regarding past actions on other religions. The ACLU/Supreme Court mention sets context but isn't the main charge of hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a very high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core argument relies heavily on **Loaded Language** and **Appeal to Fear** to portray Islam's presence in school curricula as a sinister, coordinated effort ("stealth proselytizing," "whitewashing," "encroachment," creating a "vacuum") funded by foreign powers (Saudi Arabia) and enabled by self-hating multiculturalism. It employs **Repetition** of anecdotal examples to imply a widespread problem, **Exaggeration** in describing the scale and intent, and **Obfuscation** by avoiding concrete evidence of systemic bias. It dismisses counter-arguments using **Straw Men** and **Causal Oversimplification** (blaming multiculturalism/Saudi funding). The **Red Herring** poll further signals manipulative intent. While it cites sources (Appeal to Authority), these are selectively used parents and figures who support its narrative, and the overall presentation is overwhelmingly one-sided, emotionally charged, and designed to provoke alarm and confirm a specific worldview rather than provide a balanced analysis of religious education in public schools. The pervasive use of these techniques strongly indicates its function as propaganda.
