Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the term "illegal aliens" instead of a more neutral term. It also creates a new insulting label with the phrase "less glamorous illegal aliens" to diminish the subjects further.

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the term "illegal aliens" multiple times to reinforce the author's framing. The core message that there is no real difference between DREAMERs and other immigrants in the country without authorization is also repeated: "The distinction... has always been a matter of rhetoric, not substance" and "If you legalize them, you move closer to legalizing all illegals."

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable, or chant-like phrases.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses the statement, "If you legalize them, you move closer to legalizing all illegals," which suggests a negative, slippery-slope outcome designed to create fear or anxiety about the consequences of the DACA policy.

Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the legitimacy of the DACA policy by calling it "Obama's illegal amnesty" and stating the distinction between DREAMERs and others is a "matter of rhetoric, not substance."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by stating that illegal aliens are "an industry: an economic industry and a political industry." This is a form of hyperbole that frames a group of people as a monolithic, non-human entity.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make any appeals to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and biased language such as "illegal aliens," "illegal amnesty," and "less glamorous illegal aliens" to evoke negative emotions and stereotypes.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular or that the reader should agree because many others do.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not attempt to explain a complex past event with a single simple cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its messaging and does not use intentionally vague or confusing language.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites "Customs and Border Protection" and "Border Patrol agents" to lend credibility to its factual claims, which are then used to support its broader, biased argument that "DREAMERs continue violating the law."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by arguing, "The distinction between the illegal aliens who benefited from Obama's illegal amnesty and other illegals has always been a matter of rhetoric, not substance." This presents only two categories (DREAMERs and "illegal aliens") and insists they are identical, ignoring any nuance or complexity in immigration law and status.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "a matter of rhetoric, not substance" is used to dismiss the entire concept of the DACA program and shut down any nuanced discussion by framing it as meaningless.

Red herring – No – The text stays focused on its central topic and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the reader.

Straw men – Yes – The text sets up and refutes an unstated argument that DREAMERs are inherently virtuous or different from other immigrants in the country without authorization. By highlighting two DACA recipients who committed a crime, it refutes this simplified, imagined position.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to objectively inform the reader about two arrests, but to persuade the audience to adopt a specific negative viewpoint towards DACA recipients and the DACA policy itself. This is achieved through a heavy and combined use of multiple propaganda techniques. The piece relies heavily on Name-calling and Loaded Language ("illegal aliens," "illegal amnesty") to frame the subjects in a negative light from the start. It employs Exaggeration ("They're an industry") to dehumanize them and an Appeal to Fear ("you move closer to legalizing all illegals") to create anxiety about policy consequences. Furthermore, it uses logical fallacies like the Black & White Fallacy to erase any nuanced distinctions and a Straw Man argument to easily discredit the position of DACA supporters. The factual reporting of the arrests by the CBP is used as a factual anchor to give the surrounding propaganda an appearance of credibility. The sheer density and variety of these techniques indicate a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than engage in a reasoned argument.
