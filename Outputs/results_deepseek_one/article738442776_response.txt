Here's the analysis of the propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to Haspel or Trump. Terms like "torture programs" are descriptive, not pejorative labels targeting a person/subject.  
2. **Repetition** – No – The core message about Haspel's involvement in torture is reiterated but not excessively repeated in a formulaic way; it’s part of a cohesive argument.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL" is absent). The text relies on substantive statements.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – While consequences of torture are mentioned ("darkest chapters," "squandered moral authority"), this frames historical critique, not fear-mongering about future alternatives.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – McCain explicitly questions Haspel’s credibility: *"Ms. Haspel needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement"* and demands assurances about her stance on torture.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Terms like "darkest chapters" are strong but contextually appropriate for describing torture; no clear overstatement/understatement of facts.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to U.S. identity/values: *"regain our position of leadership in the struggle for universal human rights—the struggle upon which this country was founded."*  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotionally charged terms: *"squandered precious moral authority," "desperately misguided decision," "darkest chapters."*  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis/hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees"). Focuses on McCain’s individual stance.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Torture’s consequences are discussed without oversimplifying its causes.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Language is clear and specific (e.g., cites McCain’s statement, Washington Post).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Leans on McCain’s authority: *"Americans who value the Constitution should take this rare moment to agree with McCain."*  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dilemma presented; acknowledges complexity (e.g., "examining Ms. Haspel’s record as well as her beliefs").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" to shut down debate; invites scrutiny.  
16. **Red herring** – No – Stays focused on Haspel’s record/torture; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Accurately represents McCain’s concerns without misrepresentation.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no deflection like "What about Obama’s policies?").  

---

**Verdict – 20% –** The text presents a critical perspective on Gina Haspel’s nomination, citing McCain’s concerns and historical context. While it uses **loaded language** (e.g., "darkest chapters"), **appeals to authority** (McCain), and **doubt** (demanding explanations), these serve an argument rooted in documented events (torture programs, Washington Post reports). It avoids overt manipulation like fear-mongering, oversimplification, or distortion. The tone is persuasive but relies on factual claims and reasoned critique rather than classic propaganda techniques. Its primary aim is advocacy, not systematic deception.
