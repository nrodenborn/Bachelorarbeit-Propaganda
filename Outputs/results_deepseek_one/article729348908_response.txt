Here's the analysis of the propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – No – The text uses factual labels ("man who wanted to join ISIS," "FBI informant," "terrorist organization") based on documented actions and legal definitions, not insulting labels applied for propagandistic effect.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message (Patel's crimes and actions) is presented narratively without significant repetition of specific phrases for emphasis.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to encapsulate a propagandistic message (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL!"). Quotes from Patel ("bigger, better, and more purposeful") are descriptive, not slogans.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the subject matter (terrorism support) is inherently concerning, the text reports facts (Patel's statements, actions, and the legal outcome) without attempting to instill fear to promote a specific agenda or alternative. The focus is on the criminal case.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of individuals, institutions, or events. It relies on court documents and statements of fact.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The reporting appears factual and proportional. Patel's actions and statements are described based on court evidence without obvious inflation or downplaying. (The quote "bigger, better, and more purposeful" is attributed to Patel, not the author).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – While American institutions (FBI, military, courts) and symbols (American flag) are mentioned, the text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to manipulate opinion. Their mention is contextual to the story.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is largely neutral and reportorial. Terms like "terrorist organization" and "holy war" are factual descriptors based on the subject matter and legal context, not emotionally charged words used to manipulate outside of factual reporting. (Phrases like "died a martyr" are attributed to Patel).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There are no comparisons made to Hitler, Nazis, or other universally despised groups to disapprove of an idea.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not suggest that Patel's views or actions are popular or that the reader should adopt them because others do.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text presents a complex narrative of events (travels, motivations, lies, investigation) without attributing the situation to a single, simplistic cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific, detailing events, locations, dates, charges, and evidence ("Jordan", "September 2016", "two counts of making false statements", "passport found near the motel").
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While court documents and prosecutors are cited as sources, this is standard journalistic practice to establish factuality, not an appeal to authority to manipulate belief in a propagandistic claim.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents a complex situation. It doesn't reduce options or solutions to a false dichotomy (e.g., "either support this policy or support terrorism").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking or discussion (e.g., "It is what it is," "That's just common sense").
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the details of Patel's actions, statements, travels, lies, and the resulting criminal charges. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text reports Patel's statements and actions, and the legal case against him. It does not misrepresent an opposing argument to refute it easily.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge anyone (e.g., the government, other groups) with hypocrisy to deflect from Patel's actions.

**Verdict – 0% – The text is a straightforward news report detailing a criminal case.** It presents factual information based on court documents, prosecutors' statements, and documented events. It uses neutral, descriptive language focused on *what happened* (Patel's actions, statements, travels, lies to recruiters, and guilty plea) and the legal consequences. There is no discernible attempt to manipulate the reader's emotions, promote a specific agenda beyond reporting the facts of the case, distort information, or employ any of the listed propaganda techniques. The purpose is informative journalism, not persuasion through propagandistic means. The inclusion of copyright and distribution information further confirms its origin as standard news reporting.
