***

Verdict – 0% – The text is a factual news report, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the public about a specific event in a neutral, objective manner. While it technically uses "Appeal to authority" by citing the police chief and official reports, this is a fundamental practice of journalism used to establish the credibility and source of facts, not to push an opinion or belief. The text is devoid of the manipulative and persuasive elements that characterize propaganda, such as loaded language, name-calling, or emotional appeals designed to sway the audience's opinion. It simply states what happened based on the available evidence.
