### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Deep State officials," "Deep State DOJ tool Rod Rosenstein," "Establishment Democrats." Insulting labels used to attack subjects.  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Deep State" repeated 4 times, "witch hunt" repeated twice. Reinforces negative framing.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "witch hunt" (used as a memorable phrase to discredit the investigation).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "insurrection taking place at the US Department of Justice" implies a threat to governance; "truth remains hidden" invokes fear of concealment.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions credibility of agencies: "DOJ refuses to comply," "agencies are likely to cite national security concerns... put them in direct conflict with Trump’s order."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates scale: "two year, multi-million dollar witch hunt"; minimizes legitimacy: "find collusion where there is none."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to American identity: "every American citizen," "truth... hidden from the eyes of the American public."  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotionally charged terms: "hoax," "insurrection," "witch hunt," "spied on," "defy," "panic mode."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No Nazi/Vichy comparisons.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Notes "months of requests from GOP lawmakers" to imply popular demand.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes entire conflict to "Deep State" sabotage: "Deep State officials... in panic mode... doing everything to keep truth hidden."  
12. **Obfuscation** – **No** – No intentionally vague phrasing; arguments are direct.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Trump’s constitutional authority: "as afforded him by the US Constitution."  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents Trump’s actions as "full transparency" vs. opponents hiding truth: "make sure the truth... remains hidden."  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "This is all you need to know" shuts down critical analysis.  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Focus remains on document release; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Opposing arguments (e.g., national security concerns) are acknowledged.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Mentions "ex-Obama officials" and "Democrats" to imply hypocrisy/partisanship.

### Verdict – 90% Propaganda – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Use of Techniques**: Employs 13/18 identified propaganda methods, including name-calling, loaded language, and fear appeals.  
2. **Framing**: Portrays Trump as a transparency advocate fighting a corrupt "Deep State" conspiracy, while opponents are labeled as obstructionists hiding truth.  
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses charged language ("witch hunt," "insurrection," "hoax") to provoke anger/distrust toward institutions.  
4. **Omission of Context**: Fails to address legitimate national security concerns (e.g., protecting sources) raised by agencies, framing resistance solely as malice.  
5. **Sourcing Bias**: Cites overtly partisan outlets (The Duran, ZeroHedge) and selectively quotes lawmakers’ letters to reinforce the narrative.  
6. **One-Sidedness**: Presents Trump’s actions as inherently righteous and opposition as illegitimate, discouraging balanced scrutiny.  

**Why not 100%?**  
The text references factual events (Trump’s declassification order, agency reviews, Halper’s involvement). However, these facts are embedded in a heavily slanted narrative that exaggerates threats, dismisses counterarguments, and vilifies opponents—hallmarks of propaganda. The 10% uncertainty reflects the presence of verifiable events, though their framing is manipulative.
