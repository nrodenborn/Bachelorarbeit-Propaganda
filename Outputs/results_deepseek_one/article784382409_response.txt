Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Pit Bull Journalist" (positive label for Loomer), "frightened puppy" (negative label for Ellison), "Communist-backed, Muslim, accused woman abuser" (multiple negative labels).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The allegations against Ellison (from both women, the police report, the 911 call, his refusal to answer) are repeated multiple times throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – While phrases like "demand justice" are used, no distinct, brief, memorable campaign-style slogan is present in the quoted text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The final paragraph suggests fear of Ellison winning the AG office: "Will the people not demand justice and vote a Communist-backed, Muslim, accused woman abuser into the office of prosecuting criminals?" This implies dangerous consequences.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Even one woman in the Loomer video says, why are they waiting till now to bring this forward? Well, for Ms. Monahan, perhaps that could be asked..." This casts doubt on the timing and potentially the credibility of Monahan's accusation.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: Describing Loomer as "hounded" Ellison and Ellison fleeing "like a frightened puppy" uses hyperbolic, emotionally charged language. Minimization: Ellison's denials are mentioned but framed dismissively ("has denied the allegations", "fails... to relay his side").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While appealing to "justice", there is no explicit appeal to patriotism, national identity, or a group identity like "true Americans" in this specific text.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Pit Bull Journalist", "hounded", "frightened puppy", "flee", "cover up", "demonize teachings", "Communist-backed, Muslim, accused woman abuser". These words carry strong negative or positive connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Associating Ellison's Muslim faith with "demonic teachings of Muhammad in the Koran" links him to a group (radical Islamists) often hated/disliked by the intended audience to discredit him.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text doesn't argue for supporting or opposing Ellison based on the popularity of that position or what others are doing. It focuses on the allegations and his response.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The text doesn't present a complex event and attribute it to a single, simple cause. It presents allegations and Ellison's response.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and specific about the allegations, sources (police report, 911 call, tweets), and Ellison's actions (fleeing, not answering). It doesn't use deliberately unclear language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – While citing documents (police report, 911 call) and tweets, it doesn't invoke an authority figure (expert, leader, institution) as support for its *opinion*. The documents are presented as evidence of the *allegations*.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – The final question frames the election choice starkly: "demand justice" (vote against Ellison) or vote for a "Communist-backed, Muslim, accused woman abuser" (vote for Ellison). It presents only these two extreme options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – The text doesn't use phrases like "it is what it is" or "that's just common sense" to shut down discussion. It actively argues its case with evidence and opinion.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The core focus is the domestic violence allegations and Ellison's response. While introducing his religion ("Muslim", "Koran") and political leaning ("Communist-backed") is inflammatory, it's used directly *against him* in the conclusion rather than to distract from the core allegations. The poll about the UN ambassador is irrelevant but presented separately as an ad/plugin, not integrated into the article's argument.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks Ellison based on the specific allegations presented (domestic violence, fleeing questions). It doesn't misrepresent his position or refute an argument he didn't make.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text mentions Democratic hypocrisy ("Democrats cover for their own, ignoring the obvious hypocrisy") but this is used to criticize their *current* defense of Ellison, not to deflect from Ellison's alleged actions by pointing to similar actions by opponents. The focus remains squarely on Ellison.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on **Name Calling** ("frightened puppy," "Communist-backed, Muslim, accused woman abuser"), **Loaded Language** throughout, and **Exaggeration** in describing the encounter. It uses **Repetition** of the allegations and **Doubt** regarding the timing of one accusation. Crucially, it employs **Reduction ad Hitlerum** by linking Ellison's faith to "demonic teachings" and a **Black & White Fallacy** in framing the election choice. While it reports factual elements (existence of allegations, police report, tweets), the language is overwhelmingly inflammatory, emotionally manipulative, and designed to vilify Ellison and instill fear about his potential election, rather than provide a neutral report. The presence of multiple techniques strongly indicates propagandistic intent.
