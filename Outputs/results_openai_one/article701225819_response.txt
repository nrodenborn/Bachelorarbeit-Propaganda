**Verdict – 90% – The text exhibits a high likelihood of being propaganda. It employs numerous propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, loaded language, exaggeration, reduction ad Hitlerum, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and doubt. The text is highly emotive, uses strong negative language, and frames the subject in an overwhelmingly negative light, often without nuance or acknowledgment of complexity. While it provides specific examples, the overall tone and structure are designed to persuade the reader to adopt a particular viewpoint and to provoke strong emotional reactions, rather than to inform in a balanced or objective manner.**
