Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – Explanation: The text labels the French justice system as “crazy” and repeatedly refers to the perpetrator as a “Muslim killer,” which is an insulting label intended to frame the subject negatively. Example: "But the system that keeps on protecting him is [crazy]."
2.  Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The core message that the killer is being deliberately protected by a failing system is repeated throughout the text using different phrases. Example: "This just continues the pattern," "the killer gets a pass," and "Now they're letting him get away with it."
3.  Slogans – No – Explanation: The text does not use any brief, memorable, or chant-like phrases to encapsulate its message.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation: The text provides a graphic and disturbing account of a murder, coupled with the assertion that the justice system is failing to act, which instills fear that similar events could occur without consequence. Example: "Sarah Lucy Halimi was thrown out of the window of the third floor Paris apartment while she begged her Muslim killer to spare her life."
5.  Doubt – Yes – Explanation: The entire article is constructed to cast doubt on the credibility and motives of the French authorities and the justice system. Example: "Sure he was crazy. So crazy he tried to contrive an alibi for his crime."
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: The text uses hyperbole to establish a pattern and strengthen its argument. Example: "Every other Muslim terrorist or killer in Europe has his actions blamed on mental illness or drug use." This is a sweeping generalization that exaggerates for effect.
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation: The text appeals to group identity by consistently highlighting the victim's Jewish identity and the killer's Muslim identity, framing the crime as an anti-Semitic act that should concern a specific community. Example: "...he vilified his victim as a Jewish person..."
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the reader's opinion. Example: "In the tragic comedy of denial that every Islamic terrorism investigation inevitably becomes..."
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation: The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis to discredit an opponent.
10. Bandwagon – No – Explanation: The text does not suggest its viewpoint is correct because it is popular; instead, it presents itself as a dissenting voice against the official narrative.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: The text reduces the complex legal and psychiatric proceedings of the case to a simple, single cause: a systemic and deliberate pattern to protect a Muslim killer. Example: "This just continues the pattern."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanation: The author's writing is direct and clear in its accusations and point of view, not deliberately vague.
13. Appeal to authority – No – Explanation: The text does not rely on the testimony of experts or authoritative figures to support its main argument, instead relying on its own interpretation of events.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation: The text presents only two possibilities regarding the killer: he is either a sane, culpable criminal or he is "crazy" and gets a pass, ignoring the complex nuances of legal insanity. Example: "Kobili isn't crazy. But the system that keeps on protecting him is."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation: The text uses cynical phrases to shut down critical thought about the official findings. Example: "Allahu Akbar usually means motive unknown." This dismisses any genuine investigation into motive as futile.
16. Red herring – No – Explanation: The article stays focused on the central argument regarding the Sarah Halimi case and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – Yes – Explanation: The text misrepresents the official position as simply labeling the killer "crazy" to let him go free. It then attacks this simplified argument rather than engaging with the actual, complex psychiatric and legal determinations. Example: "Sure he was crazy. So crazy he tried to contrive an alibi for his crime."
18. Whataboutism – No – Explanation: The text accuses the system of failure but does not use the specific tactic of deflecting an argument by pointing to an unrelated hypocrisy of the opponent.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to objectively inform but to persuade the reader of a specific viewpoint by employing a multitude of propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on loaded language and appeals to fear to create a strong emotional response. It builds its argument on a foundation of exaggeration ("Every other Muslim killer..."), causal oversimplification (reducing a complex legal case to a "pattern"), and a black & white fallacy (the killer is either evil or the system is "crazy"). Furthermore, it actively works to discredit the official narrative by casting doubt, using straw man arguments to misrepresent the opposing view, and employing thought-terminating clichés to discourage nuanced discussion. The sheer number and combination of these techniques indicate a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's perception rather than present a balanced account.
