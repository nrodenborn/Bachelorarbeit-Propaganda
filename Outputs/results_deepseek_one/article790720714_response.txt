Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Ford has been outed as a **radical political activist who promotes baby murder**" (Insulting labels attacking Ford).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrase is repeated or used as a rallying cry within the argument itself.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – While critical and dismissive of Ford, the text doesn't primarily attempt to instill fear about the consequences of alternatives (like believing Ford or confirming Kavanaugh).
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Repeatedly questions Ford's credibility and motives: "did she go to local law enforcement? Nope."; "She knew it would be made public."; "Ford didn't even think to act... until Kavanaugh was on the short list"; "Ford is not seeking justice nor is she seeking to do her 'civic duty.'"
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Minimizes Ford's testimony/claims: "provided testimony under oath without any evidence at all"; "accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault with absolutely no evidence". Exaggerates the political nature: "radical political activist who promotes baby murder and other unlawful actions"; "part of a political hit".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No direct appeal to patriotism, national identity, or loyalty to "our side" beyond the inherent political context.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Uses emotionally charged and prejudicial terms: "political hit", "ruining his good name", "radical political activist", "promotes baby murder", "unlawful actions", "destroy Brett Kavanaugh", "slander a man's character", "orchestrated".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Doesn't appeal to the popularity of the idea that Ford is part of a conspiracy; argues based on perceived evidence and motives.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – While claiming a conspiracy ("political hit", "orchestrated"), the text provides multiple points it uses as evidence (the letter leak, Seidman's comments, going to Feinstein/WaPo, timing) rather than attributing it to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are presented directly and specifically, not in a deliberately unclear or confusing way.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – No authoritative figures or institutions are cited to support the claims about Ford or the conspiracy. (Kavanaugh's denial and character witnesses are mentioned but not used as the primary evidence for the "hit" claim).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Doesn't explicitly present only two stark choices (e.g., "Either Ford is lying as part of a hit, or Kavanaugh is guilty"). It strongly argues one side but doesn't frame it as the *only* alternative.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "It is what it is," "That's just common sense," or "Case closed" used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – "her father works for the Central Intelligence Agency" and "her prior criminal political activism" are introduced, which are irrelevant to the specific allegation of sexual assault 36 years prior. Also, "one of which [Democrat members] has openly professed to sexual assault" distracts from the topic of Ford/Kavanaugh.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks Ford's credibility and motives directly, but doesn't significantly misrepresent or refute an argument she actually made (beyond denying the core allegation). It focuses on her actions and associations.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Doesn't charge Ford or Democrats with hypocrisy by pointing to inconsistent behavior *on their part* unrelated to the core allegation. (The mention of a Democrat senator's past is a red herring, not a charge of hypocrisy against Ford or the accusers specifically).

**Verdict – 95% – The text exhibits a high concentration of recognized propaganda techniques, including Name Calling, Repetition, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, and Red Herring. Its primary purpose is not balanced reporting or objective analysis, but rather to aggressively promote a specific, highly negative narrative about Christine Blasey Ford – portraying her as a dishonest, politically motivated radical participating in a conspiracy ("political hit") to destroy Brett Kavanaugh – while dismissing her testimony and evidence. The language is emotionally charged, relies on character attacks and insinuation over substantive refutation of her claims, introduces irrelevant details to smear her, and minimizes her account. The structure, including the repeated poll question, reinforces a singular, hostile perspective. While it contains factual elements (e.g., the existence of the Seidman audio, Ford going to Feinstein/WaPo), these are presented selectively and framed overwhelmingly to support the predetermined conclusion that Ford's accusation is illegitimate and politically orchestrated. This overwhelming use of persuasive techniques aimed at discrediting one side aligns strongly with the characteristics of propaganda.**
