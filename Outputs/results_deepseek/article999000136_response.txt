Here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique, followed by the verdict:

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – Examples: "George Soros-backed" (insinuating outside control), "racist, anti-semite" (direct insults against Gillum), "useful idiot" (insulting label for Smith), "cracker state" (racial slur by Smith, highlighted by the text).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan..." is repeated verbatim three times.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans (e.g., no equivalents to "Make America Great").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text implies Gillum will restrict gun rights ("Americans as criminals who need to prove their innocence") and warns of unfulfilled promises ("None of the programs... would happen"), invoking fear of dishonesty and loss of rights.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Gillum’s credibility: "Gillum has been promoting knows he isn't planning on delivering," and "what sort of useful idiot is Smith?"  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "crazy, crazy, crazies" to describe Gillum; minimization: Dismissing policy promises as "never happen."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national/group identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms: "corruption," "undercut," "racist," "anti-semite," "f***ed up state," "cracker state," "crazy, crazy, crazies."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis or hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on popularity or peer pressure.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified causes for complex issues.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is direct and inflammatory, not vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authoritative figures cited as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents Gillum as deceitful ("trying to appear as a moderate") vs. implied honesty of critics; frames gun policy as "criminals" vs. innocents.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Phrases like "Good luck with that!" and "we know that" shut down discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Mentions Claire McCaskill’s "corruption" (unrelated to Gillum) to distract.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Criticizes actual quotes (e.g., Smith’s statements) rather than misrepresenting arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy against opponents.  

### Final Verdict:
**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It employs at least 10 distinct techniques (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, exaggeration, appeal to fear, repetition) to vilify Andrew Gillum and his staff while promoting a biased narrative. The language is emotionally charged and inflammatory, selectively using undercover videos to paint Gillum as dishonest, racist, and extreme ("crazy, crazy, crazies"). It distracts with irrelevant content (Claire McCaskill reference) and uses thought-terminating clichés to discourage critical analysis. The framing ("Soros-backed," gun rights) appeals to conservative fears, and the sensationalist tone lacks balanced reporting. While it cites specific quotes, their presentation is manipulative and one-sided, leaving minimal room for neutral discourse. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the use of actual quotes, though their context is weaponized for persuasion.
