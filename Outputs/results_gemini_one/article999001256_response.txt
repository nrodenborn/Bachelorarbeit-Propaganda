Name calling – Yes – The text’s title refers to Stacey Abrams as a “Sore Loser,” and the body of the text repeats this label, calling her a "sore loser just like Hillary Clinton" and an "arrogant wanna-be first female governor of Georgia."

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief, memorable phrase to rally support for a cause.

Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses on criticizing past actions and character rather than instilling fear of a future outcome.

Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on Abrams' claims and integrity with a series of leading questions, such as, "Maybe a little electronic voter manipulation, Ms. Abrams?" and the direct statement, "Where is her evidence? She has none."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes Abrams' reasons for not conceding by calling her actions a "little temper tantrum." It also exaggerates her defeat by stating she was "easily defeated in terms of votes."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism to support its argument.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the audience, such as "sore loser," "poor sport," "arrogant wanna-be," and "little temper tantrum."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is the popular one.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes Abrams' complex legal and political challenge to a simple cause: that she is a "sore loser" having a "little temper tantrum," ignoring the substance of her claims about voter suppression.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its attacks and does not use intentionally vague language.

Appeal to authority – No – While the text quotes the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, it does so to set up its own criticism, not to use the newspaper's authority to support its own claims.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not frame the issue as a choice between only two options.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The statement "but Democrats are often like that in these races" is a dismissive generalization intended to end nuanced discussion and dismiss Abrams' actions as typical for her party.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll about Jim Acosta's press pass, which is entirely irrelevant to the topic of Stacey Abrams and the Georgia election, serving as a distraction.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents Abrams' argument about the meaning of "concession." She uses it in a moral sense ("to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper"), but the text refutes a different, literal definition ("a thing that is granted") to make her argument seem illogical.

Whataboutism – Yes – In response to Abrams' claims of voter suppression, the text deflects by raising other, unsubstantiated issues, asking, "How about non-citizens and illegal aliens voting, Ms. Abrams?" This is an attempt to charge her party with hypocrisy and change the subject.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of Stacey Abrams by using a wide array of propaganda techniques. The article is built on a foundation of name-calling ("Sore Loser," "arrogant wanna-be") and loaded language ("temper tantrum") to create a strong emotional bias from the start. It employs logical fallacies like whataboutism and straw man arguments to attack Abrams' position without engaging with its substance. Furthermore, it uses causal oversimplification to dismiss her entire legal challenge as a personality flaw. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Jim Acosta poll) and thought-terminating clichés further demonstrates that the author's goal is manipulation rather than objective reporting. The heavy and combined use of these techniques makes the text a clear example of political propaganda.
