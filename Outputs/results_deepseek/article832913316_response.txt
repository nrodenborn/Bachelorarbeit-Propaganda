Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used to attack Barr, Trump, or the report itself. "Cover up" (used by MoveOn) is a strong accusation but describes a potential action, not a direct insulting label *of a person or object*. Terms like "hand-picked" are descriptive, not inherently insulting.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The core demand to release the report publicly is repeated multiple times by different candidates ("This report should be made public immediately.", "The Special Counsel report must be publicly released in its entirety.", "Attorney General Barr—release the Mueller report...Now.", "Special counsel Mueller’s report should be made public without any delay.").
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – "Trump Is Not Above the Law" (used by MoveOn) is a brief, memorable phrase encapsulating their position. The tweets also use concise, slogan-like demands (e.g., "release the Mueller report...Now.").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes (by MoveOn) – MoveOn warns of protests if Barr intends to "cover up" the report and states, "we will not allow Trump or his hand-picked attorney general to get away with obstructing this criminal investigation," implying dire consequences (obstruction, getting away with crimes) if their demand isn't met.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes (by MoveOn) – MoveOn explicitly questions Barr's credibility and motives: "Should Barr announce his intention to cover up Mueller’s report...", "we will not allow Trump or his hand-picked attorney general to get away with obstructing...", implying they expect him to act improperly.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – While strong language is used ("cover up," "obstructing"), these are presented as potential actions rather than clear exaggerations of known facts. The reporting of the candidates' demands and Barr's statement is presented straightforwardly.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – The candidates frame the release as a matter of democratic principle and public right: "The American people deserve to know the full truth about Russia’s interference in our democracy.", "The American people have a right to know its findings." This appeals to patriotism and national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words and phrases like "cover up," "get away with," "obstructing," "abdicate its responsibility," "hand-picked," and even "deserve to know the full truth" carry strong emotional connotations (negativity for opponents, righteousness for their position).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt is made to link the opposing view (withholding the report) or its proponents to universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – While multiple candidates are shown making the demand, the text does not explicitly state or imply that releasing the report is the popular choice or that people should support it *because* it's popular. The focus is on the "right to know" and necessity, not popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text doesn't propose a simple cause for a complex event. It reports demands for transparency and concerns about potential obstruction.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The demands ("release the report") and concerns ("cover up") are stated clearly, not obscured. Barr's statement about "transparency...consistent with the law" acknowledges complexity but isn't presented as intentionally confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Barr's own testimony is cited to support the demand for transparency: "Barr testified that he would 'provide as much transparency'...", "I also believe it is very important that the public and Congress be informed...", "my goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can". This uses his authority/promises against potential inaction.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents the demand to release the report and Barr's statement about providing a summary/transparency within the law. It doesn't frame the situation as only having two absolute choices (e.g., "release everything immediately or it's a total cover-up").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – The phrases used ("deserve to know," "right to know," "cover up," "not above the law") are strong advocacy positions, but they don't inherently shut down critical thought or discussion about *how* transparency should be achieved within legal constraints (which Barr's statement acknowledges). The demands are open-ended starting points for discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the core issue: the submission of the Mueller report and the demands/arguments for its public release. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The arguments refuted or opposed (withholding the report, potential cover-up/obstruction) are directly presented as concerns based on the situation and Barr's role. No misrepresented or weaker argument is attacked.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No one in the text charges an opponent with hypocrisy by referencing unrelated wrongdoings. The criticism is focused directly on the handling of the Mueller report.

**Verdict – 15% –** The text primarily reports factual events (Mueller report submission, Democratic candidates' demands, MoveOn statement, Barr's past testimony) and presents direct advocacy positions. While the MoveOn statement uses several propaganda techniques (Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Loaded Language, Slogans) quite strongly, and the candidates' tweets use Repetition, Slogans, Flag-Waving, and Loaded Language, these elements are characteristic of strong political advocacy rather than pure propaganda. The inclusion of Barr's commitment to transparency provides balance. The core function of the text is informative reporting on the reactions to the report's submission. The propagandistic elements are present but confined mainly to the quoted advocacy statements (especially MoveOn's) and do not dominate the overall informative nature of the article.
