1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the official story of the Gulf of Tonkin incident as “‘Fake News’”, a “lie”, and a “fictitious creation”. It also calls the American mainstream media a “de facto government employee”.
2. Repetition – Yes – The central message that the government and media lied about the Gulf of Tonkin incident is repeated multiple times using phrases like “was a lie”, “one of most flagrant lies”, “it wasn’t true. At all”, and “this was a lie”.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase “‘Fake News’” is used in the title and the body of the text as a short, memorable way to frame the entire argument.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text highlights the massive death toll from the Vietnam War (“58,177 Americans would lose their lives. Additionally, over one million North and South Vietnamese... would be slaughtered”) and warns of future wars based on similar lies, quoting a colonel who says, “we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is structured to cast doubt on the credibility of the U.S. government and mainstream media, stating that “most everything the government and the media told Americans about the Gulf of Tonkin was a lie.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses phrases like “one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up” and claims “nearly all wars in US history have been started over false information,” which are significant exaggerations.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism; instead, it criticizes the government's actions and suggests they tarnished the nation's reputation.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like “slaughtered” to describe the deaths, “flagrant lies” to describe the official story, and “fictitious creation” to evoke a sense of deliberate deception.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not associate the opposing viewpoint with Hitler or any other group hated by the target audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text argues against the widely accepted story of the time and does not suggest its own viewpoint is popular with the masses. Instead, it presents its view as a truth uncovered by a select few.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The headline, “Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War,” presents a single, simple cause (a deliberate lie) for the incredibly complex series of events that led to the full-scale war.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its claims and accusations, not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites several authorities to support its claim, including former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, Vietnamese General Võ Nguyên Giáp, author Tom Wells, and Col. Macgregor.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice: either you believe the “official story” which is a “fictitious creation,” or you believe the “truth” that the government deliberately lied to start a war, ignoring more nuanced possibilities like intelligence failures or misinterpretations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The term “‘Fake News’” is used as a thought-terminating cliché. By applying this label, the text encourages the reader to dismiss the official narrative outright without further critical examination.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text includes a poll about the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, which is entirely irrelevant to the topic of the Vietnam War and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – No – The text attacks the actual “official story” promoted by the U.S. government at the time, not a distorted or fabricated version of it.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse the government of lying and deception in order to deflect from a different accusation.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a strong example of propaganda. While its central claim—that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was misrepresented to the public to justify war—is supported by significant historical evidence, the article's method of presentation relies heavily on propaganda techniques rather than objective reporting. It employs a multitude of these techniques, including loaded language ("slaughtered," "flagrant lies"), name-calling ("Fake News"), causal oversimplification (blaming the entire war on this single event), and appeal to fear (warning of future staged events). The use of a black & white fallacy presents the issue as a simple conspiracy versus a hidden truth, discouraging nuanced understanding. The article's primary goal is not merely to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific worldview of deep-seated distrust towards government and mainstream media, using a past event to fuel a present-day narrative. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Kavanaugh poll) further underscores that the article's purpose extends beyond journalism into audience manipulation and data collection.
