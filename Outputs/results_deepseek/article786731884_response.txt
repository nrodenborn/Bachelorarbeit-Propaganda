Here's the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

**Propaganda Technique Analysis:**
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Jihadist Psychopath", "Shariah barbarities", "totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces", "Stalinist", "Unholy Alliance masters" (Insulting labels for opponents)

14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents only two options: support counter-jihad measures or enable terrorism ("clearly on the side of Shariah enforcers")
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "totalitarian leftist forces", "Islamic forces" (Shuts down nuanced discussion)
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Shifts to FGM/honor killings when discussing Facebook's ban justification
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Implies Facebook supports oppressing Muslim women when enforcing content policies
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No direct hypocrisy accusations

**Verdict – 95% –** The text overwhelmingly employs propaganda techniques to advance its narrative. Key indicators include: systematic name-calling and demonization of opponents ("Jihadist Psychopath", "Stalinist"), emotional fear appeals (9/11 references), loaded language ("barbarities", "devouring"), false dichotomies (either support counter-jihad or side with oppressors), exaggeration of threats, and multiple logical fallacies (straw man, causal oversimplification). It frames complex geopolitical issues in reductive, us-vs-them terms while obscuring Facebook's actual content policies. The commercial book promotion embedded in the editorial note further signals persuasive intent. While containing factual elements (the Facebook ban occurred), the presentation is designed to provoke outrage rather than inform.
