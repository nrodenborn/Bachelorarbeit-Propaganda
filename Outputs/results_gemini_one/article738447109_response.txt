***

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it is structured around factual events (the firing of Tillerson and the appointments of Pompeo and Haspel), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint. This is achieved through the pervasive use of numerous propaganda techniques.

The piece is framed from the outset with a title (“From Bad To Worse?”) that presents a black & white fallacy and appeals to fear. It selectively uses sources, relying exclusively on the authority of figures like Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald, who are known critics of the subjects, to build its case (Appeal to Authority). The author employs loaded language (“criminal activity of the Deep State,” “horrific torture”) and name-calling (“un-American,” “actual torturer”) to create a strong emotional bias against the new appointees.

Furthermore, the article uses techniques like bandwagon (“many of us are concerned”) to create a sense of shared outrage and exaggeration via Snowden’s “skulls and lightning bolts” comment, which also functions as a Reduction ad Hitlerum. The combination of these techniques, the one-sided presentation, and the explicitly opinionated conclusion (“it looks like it’s about to get a lot worse”) demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's perception rather than provide a balanced and objective report.
