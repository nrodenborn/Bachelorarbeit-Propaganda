1. Name calling – No – The text uses factual descriptors like "gunman" rather than insulting labels intended to attack a subject.
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that the ammo dealer, Douglas Haig, was unaware of the gunman's intentions is repeated throughout the text in various forms, such as "saw nothing suspicious," "had no reason to believe," "wishes there was some clue," and "I couldn't detect anything wrong with this guy."
3. Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases that are used as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – No – While the text describes a frightening event, it does not use fear to support an idea or argue against an alternative.
5. Doubt – Yes – The lawyer's entire defense is built on creating doubt about his client's culpability. The text also casts doubt on the court documents by stating Haig was named a "person of interest" by mistake.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The lawyer minimizes the significance of his client's actions with the statement, "He is as connected (to Paddock) as the guy who sold him a hamburger for lunch."
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make any appeals to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The lawyer uses emotionally charged language to generate sympathy for his client, describing him as "disturbed" and stating he "wishes there was some clue."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or any other hated group.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is correct simply because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The lawyer's comparison of selling hundreds of rounds of ammunition to selling a hamburger is a causal oversimplification, reducing a complex and significant event to a mundane, everyday transaction.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is a news report that aims for clarity, and while it reports on the vagueness of officials, it does not use this technique itself.
13. Appeal to authority – No – An expert is quoted to provide factual context, which is a standard journalistic practice, not a fallacious appeal to authority to win an argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The lawyer's argument presents a false choice: either his client saw a clear, undeniable clue, or there was "just nothing" suspicious at all, ignoring any middle ground or nuanced possibilities.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "There was just nothing" is used as an absolute statement to discourage further critical thought about whether the dealer should have been suspicious.
16. Red herring – No – The text does not introduce irrelevant material for the purpose of distraction.
17. Straw men – No – The lawyer is defending against potential or implied accusations, not refuting a specific, misrepresented argument from an opponent.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain any instances of accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 35% – The text is a news article from a reputable source, the Associated Press, and its primary purpose is to inform, not persuade. It adheres to journalistic standards by including multiple perspectives, such as a firearms expert and the fact that officials declined to comment. However, the article's content is dominated by statements from the ammo dealer's lawyer. This lawyer's defense is a form of public relations that heavily employs numerous propaganda techniques (Repetition, Minimization, Loaded Language, etc.) to shape a narrative of his client's innocence. Because the article gives such a prominent platform to this one-sided, persuasive messaging, with the headline and lead paragraph dedicated to it, it acts as a powerful conduit for that propaganda. Therefore, while the text is not propaganda in its intent or creation, its content and framing are significantly propagandistic, blurring the line between reporting on a narrative and promoting it.
