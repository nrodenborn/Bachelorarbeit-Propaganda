Based on the definitions provided and the text of the Reuters article, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "targeted Hungarian-born U.S. financier George Soros", "...compared Soros... to a puppet master", "the image of Soros". Orban consistently uses negative labels for Soros.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – While the theme of migration is constant, the article reports different statements made in one speech/campaign launch. There isn't a single specific message repeated verbatim multiple times within the reported text.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Stop Soros" law. This is a brief, memorable phrase used to label legislation.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "our worst nightmares can come true", "The West falls as it fails to see Europe being overrun", "the danger we face comes from the West", linking migration to the downfall of Europe/Christianity/nation states.
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – While Orban attacks others (EU, Soros), he doesn't primarily frame his arguments by questioning their *credibility* in a general sense; he makes direct accusations and assertions.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: Portraying migration as an existential threat leading to the "fall" of the West and the realization of "worst nightmares". Minimization: Downplaying criticisms of his methods as simply "called authoritarian" by critics.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "Christianity is Europe's last hope", "saviour of Europe's Christian nations", "patriotic direction", "ethnic homogeneity", appeal to national identity and Christian identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "overrun", "worst nightmares", "danger", "puppet master", "antagonised", "undermine", "vicious struggle", "dark tones", "oppressive". These words carry strong negative emotional connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – While Soros compares Orban to Nazis/Communists, this is reported as Soros's view, not Orban's argument. Orban himself does not try to discredit an idea by linking it to Nazis/Communists within the quotes provided.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "we are not alone and we will fight together", listing allies (US, UK, Israel, Visegrad, Croatia, Austria, Bavaria), "we are winning", appeal based on claimed popularity and alliance strength.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributing the complex phenomenon of migration primarily to George Soros ("Attributing to Soros a recent United Nations plan...", "Soros has antagonised... Everywhere he wants to get migration accepted"), implying he is the main cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Orban's statements, while inflammatory, are relatively direct about his targets (migration, Soros, the West) and intentions ("fight", "use ever stronger legal tools", "prevent").
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – "Soros has antagonised not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too". Citing these powerful figures/entities as sharing his opposition to lend weight to his cause.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presenting a stark division: East (nation states, good) vs. West ("immigrant zone", "mixed population world", bad). Only two options presented for Europe's future.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – While slogans like "Stop Soros" exist, the quotes provided don't show phrases specifically used to *discourage critical thought or discussion* within the text. His phrases are more rallying cries.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The article focuses on Orban's speech about migration, Soros, and alliances. There isn't an obvious introduction of *irrelevant* material to distract from his core message within the quotes.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Orban attacks positions actually held by his opponents (EU support for migration, Soros's open-border philanthropy). He doesn't refute a significantly misrepresented argument within the quoted text.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Orban doesn't deflect criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy in the quoted statements. He directly attacks their positions.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text reports on a speech by Viktor Orban that heavily employs propaganda techniques. The vast majority of the quoted statements from Orban contain multiple techniques: **Name Calling** (targeting Soros), **Slogans** ("Stop Soros"), **Appeal to Fear** (migration as an existential threat), **Exaggeration** (scale of the threat), **Flag-Waving** (Christianity, patriotism), **Loaded Language** (emotionally charged terms), **Bandwagon** (claiming powerful allies), **Causal Oversimplification** (blaming Soros for migration), **Appeal to Authority** (citing Trump, UK, Israel), and **Black & White Fallacy** (East vs. West). While the article itself is a news report (Reuters) that includes context and Soros's counter-criticism, the core content being reported – Orban's own words – is demonstrably propagandistic in nature. The high concentration of these techniques within his statements forms the basis of his political appeal and campaign messaging, as described in the article. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the journalistic framing of the report.
