Name calling – Yes – The text reports that the man in the video used insults like "s--- n----!" and "b---- a-- motherf------". It also reports that a Facebook post referred to the attacker as a "scum bag of the year.”

Repetition – No – The text is a news report that presents a sequence of events from different sources, not a repeated message.

Slogans – Yes – The text is centered around the "Make America Great Again” hat, which is a prominent political slogan.

Appeal to fear – No – The text reports on a frightening event but does not use fear to support a particular idea or warn against alternatives.

Doubt – No – The text does not attempt to question the credibility of a person or source to advance a specific agenda.

Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text reports on quotes that use exaggeration (e.g., "scum bag of the year"), but the article's own narrative does not appear to exaggerate or minimize the events.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The conflict is centered on a "Make America Great Again" hat, a symbol of political identity and patriotism for its supporters. The teen's quote, "I support my President," reinforces this.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text quotes emotionally charged and stereotypical language, such as the racial slur and profanity used by the attacker ("s--- n----!", "b---- a-- motherf------").

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is bad by associating it with a group hated by the target audience.

Bandwagon – No – While the text mentions the video went "viral" with "more than two million views," this is reported as a factual element of the story's development, not as a means to persuade the reader that an idea is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text reports a direct cause for a specific event (the assault happened because of the hat), which is the central point of the news story, not an oversimplification of a larger, more complex issue.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is specific, providing names, locations, and direct quotes. It is not deliberately unclear or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses statements from authorities like the San Antonio police, Whataburger corporate, and the Rumble bar to lend credibility and provide evidence for the reported facts.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The central conflict is framed as a binary opposition between two political sides (pro-Trump vs. anti-Trump). The teen's quote also presents a false dichotomy: "let’s have a conversation about it instead of ripping my hat off,” simplifying the possible reactions to political disagreement.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase from the Rumble bar, "THIS BAR IS A SAFE SPACE FOR EVERYONE!", can be seen as a thought-terminating cliché used to end discussion and signal a broad, non-controversial stance without engaging with the complexities of the political conflict.

Red herring – No – The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main issue. All details relate directly to the incident and its aftermath.

Straw men – No – The text reports on a direct conflict and does not create or refute a mischaracterized or non-existent argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not use the technique of deflecting criticism by accusing the opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 70% – While this text is structured as a news report and is based on a factual event, it functions as propaganda through story selection and framing. The article was published by Fox News, an outlet with a known conservative-leaning audience. The choice to highlight this specific story—where a young supporter of President Trump is the sympathetic victim of a profane and violent aggressor—serves to reinforce a specific narrative for its target audience: that political opponents are unhinged, hateful, and dangerous.

The article carefully includes journalistic elements like quotes from the police and the companies involved (Appeal to Authority), which gives it a veneer of objectivity. However, the emotional core of the story relies on the techniques of Flag-Waving (the MAGA hat), Loaded Language (the reported slurs), and the Black & White Fallacy (the conflict between the two sides). By presenting the facts of this specific, emotionally charged incident, the article promotes a partisan worldview and stokes outrage and solidarity among its readers, which is a primary goal of propaganda. It is not fabricating information, but it is using the selective reporting of facts to achieve a propagandistic effect.
