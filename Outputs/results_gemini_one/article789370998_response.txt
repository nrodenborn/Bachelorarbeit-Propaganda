Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack opponents, such as calling the confirmation process "The Left’s Show Trial" and referring to Michael Avenatti as a "media-savvy sleazeball lawyer."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly pushes the message that the allegations are a last-minute, politically motivated smear, using phrases like "materialized out of thin air," "Suspiciously," "questionable claims," "delaying tactics," and "last-minute allegations."

Slogans – Yes – The title itself, "The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh," functions as a brief, memorable phrase that encapsulates the entire argument of the piece.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear that if the confirmation is delayed, "the Supreme Court will be shorthanded" and that "Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they stand a good chance of taking control from Republicans," creating urgency and fear of losing political power.

Doubt – Yes – The text actively works to create doubt about the accusers' credibility, stating, "Suspiciously, Ford can’t –or won’t— say when or where the alleged incident happened" and mentioning "two new women with questionable claims."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by claiming the accusers "materialized out of thin air" and minimizes the seriousness of the allegations by framing the entire situation as a political "Show Trial" and a "smear, plain and simple."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to political identity by framing the conflict as a battle between "Republicans" and "The Left" or "Democrats," urging the reader to side with their political tribe against the other. For example: "As usual, Republicans’ seeming reasonableness is rewarded with more abuse by the Left."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to influence the reader, such as "dubious improprieties," "gaming the system," "more abuse by the Left," and "sleazeball lawyer."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or Hitler.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that knowledgeable people are on the side of confirmation, stating, "Washington insiders still believe Kavanaugh will be confirmed" and quoting an expert who says there is "exactly a zero percent chance" that Republican leaders will let the nomination fail.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies a complex situation by attributing the allegations solely to one cause: a political strategy by Democrats. For example: "Democrats, it turns out, used the extra time created through their delaying tactics to produce two new women with questionable claims against Kavanaugh."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its viewpoint and accusations; it does not use vague or obscure language to confuse the audience.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the expert opinion of "Thomas C. Goldstein of the law firm of Goldstein & Russell," who is described as a "co-founder of SCOTUSblog who has appeared before the Supreme Court many times," to lend credibility to the prediction that Kavanaugh will be confirmed.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between two extremes: either the allegations are a complete "smear, plain and simple" orchestrated by the Left, or Kavanaugh is entirely innocent. It leaves no room for nuance or alternative possibilities.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a cliché to shut down discussion and dismiss the opposition's actions: "Give left-wingers an inch and they’ll take a mile."

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces irrelevant information to discredit an opponent by mentioning that Michael Avenatti "represents porn star Stormy Daniels," which has no bearing on his current client's claims but serves to associate him with a past controversy.

Straw men – No – The text primarily attacks the character and motives of the opponents rather than misrepresenting and then refuting a specific argument they have made.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge the opposition with hypocrisy by pointing to a similar past failing on their part.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a very high number of propaganda techniques (14 out of 18) to promote a specific, one-sided political viewpoint. Rather than presenting a balanced and factual account of events, the piece uses name-calling, loaded language, and appeals to fear and identity to persuade the reader to dismiss the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh as a purely political "smear" and a "show trial." It consistently questions the credibility and motives of one side while presenting the other's as straightforward and truthful, simplifying a complex issue into a binary conflict between good (Republicans/Kavanaugh) and evil (The Left/Democrats). The primary goal is not to inform, but to manipulate the reader's opinion.
