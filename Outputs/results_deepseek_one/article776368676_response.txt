Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "rigged witch hunt", "17 angry Democrats", "doing his dirty work", "disgrace to USA", "deep state coup attempt". These are insulting labels applied to the investigation, Mueller, and his team.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "rigged witch hunt" is repeated multiple times ("stop the rigged witch hunt", "this Rigged Witch Hunt", "cancel this witch hunt").
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Stop the Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!" and "Lock them all up" are brief, memorable phrases used for impact.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Trump claims the investigation will "stain our country any further," implying severe national harm if it continues.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Mueller is totally conflicted", "Mueller is going to protect these guys", "Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity". These statements explicitly question Mueller's credibility and impartiality.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – Explanation: While strong language is used ("terrible situation", "disgrace"), the text doesn't clearly present an example of significantly overstating or understating a fact *relative to the source's perspective* within the quoted sections. The claims themselves are hyperbolic, but fit more clearly under "Name Calling" and "Appeal to Fear".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: "stain our country", "disgrace to USA", "stop the will of We the People!!!". These phrases appeal directly to patriotism and national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: "rigged witch hunt", "angry Democrats", "dirty work", "disgrace", "deep state coup attempt", "jail Mueller", "Lock them all up". These words/phrases are heavily emotionally charged and use negative stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not associate the investigation or its supporters with groups specifically hated by the audience (like Nazis, fascists, communists) in the quoted statements. "Deep state" implies corruption but not a specific historically reviled group.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Explanation: "And Trump is far from the only American who sees the investigation as a witch hunt. Many Twitter users have taken his side..." This suggests the view is popular and implies others should join.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text doesn't attribute a complex event (like the investigation's origins or findings) to a single, simple cause. It presents grievances but not a simplistic causal chain for a major event.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The language used by Trump and the quoted tweet is actually quite direct and inflammatory, not deliberately obscure or vague. Terms like "deep state" are vague but commonly used in this context; the intent seems more inflammatory than purely obfuscating here.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Trump cites "ALAN DERSHOWITZ" to support his claim about Mueller's lack of objectivity ("Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity...").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: The framing presents the investigation as inherently bad ("rigged witch hunt", "disgrace") that must be stopped *immediately* ("NOW!") to prevent national harm, implying there are no legitimate reasons for it to continue or nuances to consider. The "Lock them all up" demand also presents a simplistic solution.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Enough is enough!!!" and "Lock them all up" are phrases used to shut down discussion and critical analysis, presenting a simple, emotionally charged conclusion.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: While the text attacks Mueller's team (Strzok, the "17 Angry Democrats"), these attacks are directly related to the *credibility* of the investigation Trump wants stopped. They aren't clearly *irrelevant* distractions from the core issue of whether Trump should order it stopped. The core argument (investigation is corrupt) uses these points.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text attacks the investigation based on the *stated* reasons Trump and his supporters oppose it (conflict, bias, being a "witch hunt"). It doesn't misrepresent the opposing argument (that the investigation is legitimate and necessary) and then refute that misrepresentation.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not attempt to deflect criticism of Trump's actions by accusing critics of hypocrisy regarding a different issue.

**Verdict – 75% – Detailed Explanation:** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its core consists of direct quotes from Donald Trump and a supporter (Comfortably Smug) which heavily employ numerous propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Bandwagon, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-Terminating Clichés). The purpose is clearly to discredit the Mueller investigation, pressure the Attorney General to end it, and rally support by framing it as an illegitimate attack on Trump and the nation itself. While the article includes some neutral reporting context (e.g., Sessions' recusal, Giuliani/Sekulow's comments, Leahy's response) and attributes sources, these elements primarily serve to frame and present the propagandistic core quotes and their central message. The overwhelming use of multiple, potent propaganda techniques within the quoted statements, which form the heart of the article's narrative, makes it highly likely to be propaganda. The 25% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of contextual reporting and opposing viewpoints (Leahy), though they are clearly secondary to the propagandistic message conveyed by the quoted tweets.
