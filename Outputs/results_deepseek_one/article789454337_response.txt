Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: The term "blue privilege" is used as an insulting label targeting police officers and the perceived systemic bias favoring them.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "blue privilege" acts as a brief, memorable phrase encapsulating the article's core accusation.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text instills fear by stating police "have a license to kill" and "cannot be trusted to monitor themselves," implying a dangerous lack of accountability for law enforcement.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text repeatedly casts doubt on police actions and motives: "It would be reasonable to assume that these steps were taken intentionally because they want to see her get away with it," "Police claim to have found...," "Merrit cast suspicion on the police for intentionally keeping these protestors in jail," "They have no interest in serving justice..."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggeration is used in "ruined the investigation" (implies total destruction) and "not even the richest people... would receive this type of treatment" (an extreme claim). Minimization is implied in describing the marijuana found as a "very small amount" used to "smear his name," downplaying its potential relevance while maximizing the negative intent.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not appeal to patriotism, national identity, or a specific group identity like "We the People" in a unifying or rallying manner. It focuses on division and injustice.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Numerous emotionally charged words and phrases are used: "glaring example," "for no reason," "rot in jail," "smear his name," "special treatment," "injustice," "completely unjustifiable," "license to kill," "cannot be trusted."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not compare its targets (police, the system) to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally condemned groups/movements.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not argue that its viewpoint is correct because it's popular or gaining support. It focuses on the specific case and injustice.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text blames the entire difficulty of prosecution ("ruined the investigation, making it harder to prosecute her") solely on the failure to search Guyger's apartment immediately, ignoring other potential complexities in evidence collection and legal procedure.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is generally direct and accusatory, not deliberately unclear or obscure. It states its points explicitly.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text quotes Attorney Lee Merritt ("Merritt said in a statement") to support its claims about injustice and police motives, using his status as the Jean family's representative as validation.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text presents the police as completely untrustworthy and solely self-interested ("They have no interest in serving justice when it comes to enforcing crimes against their own," "cannot be trusted to monitor themselves"), leaving no room for nuance or good actors within the system.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not employ simplistic phrases designed to shut down discussion (e.g., "it is what it is," "that's just common sense"). It attempts to argue its case.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: Introducing the detail about marijuana found in Jean's apartment ("Police claim to have found a very small amount of marijuana, which they attempted to use to smear his name") is arguably irrelevant to the central question of Guyger's actions and the investigation into them, potentially distracting by implying victim-blaming.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not explicitly misrepresent an opposing argument and then refute that misrepresentation. It attacks the actions and motives it perceives.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not deflect criticism of Guyger or the police by accusing critics of hypocrisy related to a different issue. It focuses on the specific case and contrasting treatment (Guyger vs. protestors).

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits a significant number of propaganda techniques (10 out of 18 analyzed). It heavily relies on **Loaded Language**, **Name Calling** ("blue privilege"), **Doubt**, **Appeal to Fear**, and **Appeal to Authority** to frame the narrative. It also employs **Exaggeration**, **Causal Oversimplification**, **Black & White Fallacy**, **Repetition** (poll), and potentially a **Red Herring** (marijuana). While presenting factual events (the shooting, the protests, the arrests, the charges), the text selects and frames these facts to maximize outrage, minimize counter-narratives, and promote a specific interpretation of systemic police bias and injustice. The strong emotional language, selective emphasis, and use of multiple persuasive techniques designed to evoke anger and distrust indicate a high likelihood that this text functions as propaganda for a particular viewpoint on police accountability and racial/social justice, rather than a strictly neutral report. The presence of the repetitive poll also signals an intent beyond simple information sharing.
