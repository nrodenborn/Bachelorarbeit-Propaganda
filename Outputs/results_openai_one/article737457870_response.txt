**Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, red herring, and whataboutism. These elements suggest a significant likelihood that the text is intended to influence the audience's perception of certain political figures and issues by using emotionally charged language and questioning credibility. However, it does not employ all the techniques listed, and some parts of the text provide factual information, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood of it being pure propaganda.**
