Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including repetition, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, bandwagon, and appeal to authority. These elements suggest a moderate likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it aims to influence the reader's perception of the Hammonds' situation and the actions of the previous administration. However, the lack of more aggressive techniques like name-calling or appeal to fear indicates that it is not an extreme example of propaganda.
