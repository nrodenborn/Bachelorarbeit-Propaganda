Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – Trump asks "What kind of man is this?" regarding Sessions' recusal, implying deficiency.
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated consistently throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – While Sessions makes declarative statements, none are brief, catchy phrases designed as slogans (e.g., "Make America Great Again").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – Neither Trump nor Sessions uses fear of alternatives to support their points.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – Trump questions Sessions' credibility by stating he "never took control of the Justice Department" and implying he's not the right "kind of man."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Possible – Sessions claims "unprecedented success" at effectuating Trump's agenda. This could be seen as exaggeration, though it's a subjective claim. Trump's characterization of Sessions might be seen as minimization. *Borderline, but leaning towards subjective opinion rather than clear-cut propaganda exaggeration.* **Answer: No** – While strong claims are made, they fall within typical political rhetoric and aren't blatantly false or minimized to the level of propaganda.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Sessions appeals to patriotism/identity: "no nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States" and mentions protecting "the safety and security and rights of the American people."
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Sessions uses emotionally positive language like "unprecedented success," "protects... rights," "highest standards," "take action," "talented, more dedicated." Trump uses emotionally negative language like "never took control," "What kind of man is this?" and "blasted."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt to link the opposition to universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to the popularity of an idea or action.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No complex events are attributed to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The statements made by both Trump and Sessions, while politically charged, are relatively clear and direct about their criticisms and defenses. Sessions' list of successes is broad but not intentionally vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Neither side explicitly cites an external authority figure or institution as evidence for their claims. Sessions references his own position and actions.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dilemma presenting only two extreme choices is presented.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used explicitly to shut down critical thinking (e.g., "America: love it or leave it," "it is what it is" used dismissively). Sessions' statements are substantive defenses.
16. **Red herring** – No – The discussion stays focused on Sessions' performance, recusal, and control of the DOJ. Hunter's indictment is mentioned as context for Trump's criticism but isn't used by either Trump or Sessions to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – Sessions directly refutes Trump's specific accusation ("never took control") by stating he took control "the day I was sworn in" and listing achievements. He doesn't misrepresent Trump's argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Neither Trump nor Sessions charges the other with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

**Verdict – 15% –** The text is primarily a straightforward news report detailing a public dispute between President Trump and Attorney General Sessions. While it contains elements common in political discourse that *can* be used in propaganda (like loaded language, name-calling, and flag-waving), these elements are reported objectively as part of the factual exchange between the two figures. The reporter does not appear to be employing these techniques *to propagandize* for one side or an agenda; rather, they are relaying the statements made by the subjects. The context provided (like Hunter's indictment) is relevant background. The overwhelming purpose is informational reporting on a political conflict, not persuasion through deceptive means. The presence of some rhetorical techniques inherent in political arguments does not make the *article itself* propaganda.
