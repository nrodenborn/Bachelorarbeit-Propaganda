### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "he is lying" (accusing the cleric of dishonesty).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" repeated three times.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Preorder *The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS*" (memorable phrase promoting a book).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "Don’t allow yourself to be deceived" (instills fear of being misled).  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "relying on the historical ignorance of his audience" (questions the cleric's credibility).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – The cleric minimizes historical persecution of Jews ("we never killed them just for being Jews"), while the author exaggerates with phrases like "wholesale slaughter."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No overt appeal to patriotism or identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "massacring," "wholesale slaughter," "groaned under the heavy yoke" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Not used in the author's rebuttal.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – The poll ("take our poll") implies joining a popular opinion.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes killings solely to religious hatred (e.g., "killed all those... except those who embraced Islam"), ignoring complex historical contexts.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are specific (e.g., dates, numbers).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites "twelfth-century Muslim historian Ibn Baydhaq" as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents Muslims as either persecutors or deceivers (e.g., "lying" cleric vs. "historical truth").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Don’t allow yourself to be deceived" (shuts down critical engagement).  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The poll about "corrupt Democrat Politician[s]" distracts from the article’s topic.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Misrepresents the cleric’s claim as "Muslims never killed Jews" (he specified "just for being Jews").  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – The cleric deflects Holocaust guilt by citing non-Jewish victims ("Hitler annihilated 400,000 Germans") and American atrocities.

### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic use of techniques**: Employs 14/18 identified propaganda methods, including loaded language, straw men, and repetition.  
2. **Agenda-driven framing**: Explicitly promotes a book (*The History of Jihad...*) while attacking a cleric’s credibility.  
3. **Emotional manipulation**: Uses graphic violence descriptions ("massacring," "100,000 killed") and fear appeals ("Don’t be deceived") to provoke outrage.  
4. **Distraction tactics**: The poll about "corrupt Democrats" is irrelevant to the topic, baiting engagement.  
5. **Selective evidence**: Cherry-picks historical atrocities to counter the cleric while ignoring nuance (e.g., periods of coexistence).  
6. **Source bias**: Published with permission from Robert Spencer, a figure known for anti-Islam rhetoric.  

The 10% uncertainty stems from the inclusion of factual historical accounts (e.g., Ibn Baydhaq’s records), but these are weaponized to support a one-sided narrative, aligning with propaganda’s core function: to persuade, not inform.
