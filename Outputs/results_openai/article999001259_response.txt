Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, and loaded language. These elements suggest a strong likelihood of the text being propaganda, as they aim to influence the reader's perception of the election process and the involved parties. The repetition of the poll question also serves to reinforce a particular narrative. However, not all techniques are present, and some elements of the text provide factual information about the court ruling and election details, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood.
