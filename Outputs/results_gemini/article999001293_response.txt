4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states, "This massive Democrat voter fraud could be the end of our free republic."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text states that Democrat election officials are “‘finding’” boxes of them everywhere," using quotation marks to question the legitimacy of the discovery.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text describes the situation as "massive Democrat voter fraud," which exaggerates the scale of the events detailed in the article.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by warning that the alleged actions could be "the end of our free republic" and by quoting Trump's statement that the situation is an "embarrassment to our County and to Democracy!"
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like "disgrace," "outraged," and "act like a child."

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll about Jim Acosta presents a primary choice between "Yes, he should have gotten it back" and "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass," creating a simplified and biased choice.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The simple, declarative statement "This is a disgrace" serves to end discussion by passing a final judgment.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about CNN's Jim Acosta is inserted into an article about the Florida election, serving as an irrelevant distraction from the main topic.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text asks, "Have you ever heard of a close election in which a recount and “found” ballots gave the Republican victory?" This refutes an unstated and simplified argument rather than addressing the Democrats' actual position on counting legally cast ballots.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects from the actions of the Republican official in Bay County by immediately changing the subject to what Democrats are allegedly doing: "Meanwhile, Democrat election officials are marking ballots themselves..."

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast majority of the listed techniques to promote a specific political narrative rather than to inform objectively. The entire structure is built on whataboutism, deflecting from a Republican official's illegal action to launch a broader attack on Democrats. This attack is fueled by an appeal to fear ("end of our free republic"), loaded language ("disgrace"), exaggeration ("massive... fraud"), and causal oversimplification. It uses an appeal to authority (quoting President Trump) to validate its viewpoint and casts doubt on its opponents through vague accusations (the "found" ballots). Furthermore, the inclusion of the completely irrelevant red herring poll about Jim Acosta—which itself uses repetition and name-calling—is a clear sign that the text's purpose is to engage and inflame a specific political base, not to engage in journalism. The sheer density and variety of these manipulative techniques confirm its nature as propaganda.
