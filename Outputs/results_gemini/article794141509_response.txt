Here are the propaganda techniques and whether they are used in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text labels the group allegedly behind the purge as “Those Who Hate Freedom,” which is an insulting label designed to attack them.

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the phrase “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” three times in a row as part of a poll. It also repeatedly uses the terms “purge” and “coordinated effort” to reinforce the central message.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate its ideas, such as “This is where free thought goes to die” and the quoted slogan, “in an empire of lies the truth is treason.”

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text is built around this technique, starting with the headline “Why the Coordinated Alternative Media Purge Should TERRIFY Everyone” and ending with “People who hate freedom will get unfettered access to the minds of 2 billion people. That should scare the crap out of you.”

Doubt – Yes – The text explicitly questions the credibility of Facebook’s stated reason for the page removals by stating, “The reason given doesn’t really add up,” and then attempting to debunk it by comparing it to the company's spam policy.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the situation by calling it “the biggest campaign against freedom of speech and thought that has ever occurred in our part of the world” and claiming that social media companies will have “unquestioned access to the minds of more than 2 billion people.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the identity of people who value freedom and patriotism by framing the issue as a battle for the ability “to be free to question the status quo.” It heavily uses the word “freedom” and invokes Ron Paul, a figure associated with American libertarian ideals.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words throughout, such as “TERRIFY,” “purge,” “silence,” “monopoly,” “assault,” “doomed,” and “brainwashing” to evoke strong emotional reactions rather than rational judgment.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by suggesting it is popular with Nazis or a similar, specific group hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text lists the popular pages that were removed and highlights their large fan counts, such as “The AntiMedia (2.1 million fans)” and “The Free Thought Project (3.1 million fans),” to suggest that because the idea is popular with millions, it must be correct.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text assumes a single, simple cause for a complex event. It claims the pages were removed as part of a “coordinated effort to silence large swaths of the population,” dismissing the companies’ stated, more nuanced reasons related to spam and inauthentic behavior policies.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text is vague about who is behind the “coordinated effort,” referring to them only as “they” or “Those Who Hate Freedom.” This creates an ominous but ill-defined enemy.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from Ron Paul, described as “the libertarian voice of reason,” and presents him as an authority whose opinion should be accepted as evidence for the article's claims.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: the “alternative media,” which provides truth and freedom, and the “corporate media” and tech companies, which provide only “one side of the story” and engage in “brainwashing.” It allows for no middle ground or nuance.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the quote, “in an empire of lies the truth is treason,” as a thought-terminating cliché. This phrase is used to shut down critical thought by framing any disagreement or alternative explanation as part of the “empire of lies.”

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll, “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?,” which is completely irrelevant to the topic of the social media purge. It serves to distract the reader and collect user data.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that was not presented by the Washington Post. It claims the Post changed its headline because it was hypocritical for “pushing political messages for profit,” misrepresenting the likely reason for the change (which was to more accurately reflect the "spam" angle) in order to more easily attack the publication's credibility.

Whataboutism – Yes – When criticizing the Washington Post’s initial headline, the author deflects by charging the Post with hypocrisy: “but of course, since they too push political messages for profit (waaah, Trump!) as do all the other corporate media outlets out there…” This is a direct attempt to discredit the source rather than address the substance of its reporting.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs 17 of the 18 listed propaganda techniques, often using multiple techniques within the same sentence. The article is not structured to inform or present a balanced view; its primary goal is to persuade the reader through emotional manipulation and logical fallacies. The entire piece is framed by an **Appeal to Fear**, uses **Loaded Language** and **Name Calling** to create a villain (“Those Who Hate Freedom”), and presents a **Black & White Fallacy** of a world divided between a truthful “alternative media” and a deceitful “establishment.” It relies on **Causal Oversimplification** to create a simple, conspiratorial narrative of a “coordinated purge” while using techniques like **Whataboutism** and **Doubt** to dismiss any official explanations. The combination of these methods is designed to bypass critical thinking and incite an emotional response, which is the fundamental purpose of propaganda.
