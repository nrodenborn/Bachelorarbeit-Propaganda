Here is the analysis of the text based on the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  Name calling – Yes – Explanation: The text uses insulting labels for groups it opposes, such as calling officials "neocon warhawks" and the foreign policy establishment a "swamp."
2.  Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times in a row.
3.  Slogans – Yes – Explanation: The text employs the well-known slogan "fake news" to dismiss official information. Example: "...this is an example of President Trump’s comments on fake news, he should not be sabotage by fake news.”
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation: The text builds fear by suggesting a "false flag" incident could lead to a devastating war with Iran, resulting in "horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias."
5.  Doubt – Yes – Explanation: The entire premise of the article is to cast doubt on the credibility of the U.S. government and mainstream media. Example: "In fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government..."
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: The text uses hyperbole to describe events and ideas. Example: It calls the idea of a beneficial US intervention "outright insane" and the Gulf of Tonkin incident "perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up."
7.  Flag-Waving – No – Explanation: The text does not appeal to patriotism to support its argument. Instead, it criticizes the nation's actions, claiming they have "tarnish[ed] the reputation of a nation."
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: The article is filled with emotionally charged words intended to influence the reader, such as "flagrant lies," "fictitious creation," "hellbent," and "war-ravaged dystopias."
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation: The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – Explanation: The text does not argue that its position is popular. It frames its view as a contrarian one held by those "paying attention" against the mainstream narrative.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: The text simplifies decades of complex foreign policy by claiming it follows a simple plan from a 2001 memo to "take out seven countries," with presidents just "cross[ing] countries off this list."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanation: The article is very direct in its claims and accusations and does not use intentionally vague or obscure language.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation: The text heavily relies on quotes from figures presented as credible authorities to support its claims, including "Army Colonel Douglas Macgregor," "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh," and "General Wesley Clark."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation: The poll inserted in the text presents only two absolute choices: "* Yes, he will be confirmed. No, he will not be confirmed," eliminating any possibility of nuance or uncertainty.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation: The term "fake news" is used as a cliché to dismiss official statements without requiring critical engagement with their content.
16. Red herring – Yes – Explanation: The text introduces a poll about the Supreme Court confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, which is entirely unrelated to the article's topic of a potential war with Iran, serving only as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – Explanation: The text sets up a simplified version of its opponents' argument—that the "neocons’ claims that Iran is the 'greatest threat' to America"—which it then easily refutes by pointing to other threats, rather than engaging with more complex geopolitical arguments.
18. Whataboutism – No – Explanation: The text criticizes US policy but does not use the technique of deflecting a specific charge by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It is not a piece of objective journalism but a persuasive article constructed to promote a specific, anti-establishment, and anti-interventionist narrative. Its primary goal is to indoctrinate the reader into a particular worldview rather than to inform them neutrally.

The text systematically employs a vast number of propaganda techniques to achieve its goal. It builds its entire argument on an **Appeal to Fear**, using the historical analogy of the Gulf of Tonkin incident to suggest a similar deception will be used to start a war with Iran, leading to "war-ravaged dystopias." It relentlessly uses **Doubt** and **Loaded Language** ("flagrant lies," "fictitious creation") to discredit official sources like the government and "mainstream media." Opponents are dismissed with **Name Calling** ("neocon warhawks," "swamp").

To bolster its own credibility, the article makes a strong **Appeal to Authority**, citing a colonel, a general, and a Pulitzer-winning journalist to make its conspiratorial claims seem like insider knowledge. The narrative is built on **Causal Oversimplification**, reducing decades of complex Middle Eastern policy to a simple checklist from a single memo. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant **Red Herring** (the Kavanaugh poll) is a clear sign that the article's purpose extends beyond informing to include other manipulative goals, such as data collection. The sheer density and combination of these techniques confirm that the text is a deliberate piece of propaganda.
