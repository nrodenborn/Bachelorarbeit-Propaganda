Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "a pathetic attempt at a cover-up" (Insulting label applied to the official story).
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – The helicopter theory is mentioned repeatedly but not a *specific, identical* phrase.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrase is used as a rallying cry.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text implies a massive government cover-up of a horrific event involving mysterious soldiers and attack helicopters, instilling fear/distrust of authorities ("pathetic attempt at a cover-up", "still unidentified team", "unknown soldiers").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explicitly questions the FBI's investigation ("the owner of the camera was never approached by the FBI, who have so far never seen the footage, much less investigated it") and the official story ("proven... to be absolutely false").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates the significance/evidence of helicopters ("ignited the theory", "that possibility seems all the more plausible", "literally show", "seems to literally show", "proven... absolutely false"). Minimizes the official story ("nothing more than a pathetic attempt").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Uses emotionally charged or suggestive words: "horrific attack", "Amazingly", "Astonishingly", "massacre", "fateful night", "WTF video", "pathetic attempt", "cover-up".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Appeals to the popularity of the theory ("multiple videos have been released that **many believe** show helicopters", "research by **a group of investigators** who believe").
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Does not oversimplify the *cause* of the massacre itself.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Uses vague terms like "multiple other videos", "a group of investigators", "a still unidentified team", "unknown soldiers", "gear", without providing concrete details or verifiable sources.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Tucker Carlson, Shepard Ambellas (Intellihub), and The Daily Sheeple as sources validating the claims and footage.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as either the official story (a "pathetic" "cover-up" that is "absolutely false") OR the helicopter attack theory (implied as the only plausible truth given the "evidence").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases used to shut down critical discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Focuses heavily on the presence of helicopters and the FBI not seeing *this specific footage*, potentially distracting from other aspects of the event or the lack of conclusive evidence linking helicopters to the attack itself.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Does not explicitly refute a misrepresented argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Does not charge opponents with hypocrisy regarding this event.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is to promote a specific conspiracy theory (helicopters attacking/participating in the massacre and a government cover-up) by selectively presenting information, using highly loaded language, appealing to dubious authorities and popular belief in the theory, exaggerating the significance of ambiguous footage, creating doubt about official investigations, framing the narrative in black-and-white terms, and employing obfuscation. While it presents itself as investigative reporting, the consistent use of these techniques strongly indicates an intent to persuade readers towards a specific, unverified narrative rather than objectively report facts. The lack of verifiable evidence for its central claims and reliance on emotionally manipulative language further support this assessment.
