Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied. Terms like "suspect" and "convicted felon" are factual descriptors based on the events and legal record reported.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message (the incident and prior history) is stated factually without unnecessary repetition for emphasis.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to summarize a position or evoke emotion.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The tragic events are reported factually. While the events themselves are frightening, the text does not use them to instill fear against alternatives or promote a specific idea.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of anyone involved. It reports statements and facts.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Events are reported matter-of-factly. The severity of the shootings and prior incidents (like the threat to kill) are presented without apparent inflation or downplaying.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal is made to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty to support an idea.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – Language is largely neutral and descriptive. Terms like "fatally shot," "critical condition," "pleading for help," and "forced himself on her" are factual descriptions of events reported. While evocative, they are not used manipulatively to trigger stereotypes or strong emotions beyond conveying the seriousness of the events.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt is made to link any idea or person to universally despised groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea to encourage acceptance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text reports complex events (the shootings, the prior domestic disputes) without suggesting a single, simple cause. It presents multiple factors and reports.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text provides specific details (times, dates, quotes, locations, prior incidents) and clarifies uncertainties ("It's unclear at what point Smith was shot").
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While police reports and statements are cited as sources of information, they are not used as evidence to support a specific argument or claim beyond reporting what happened and what was documented. The text relies on factual reporting of events and records.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text reports a complex situation with multiple prior incidents and perspectives without presenting only two simplistic choices or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No simplistic phrases are used to shut down critical thought or discussion. The text invites understanding through detailed reporting.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the incident, the 911 calls, and the relevant prior history of police involvement. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text reports events and statements. It does not present or refute any arguments not actually made.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy are made against any party involved.

**Verdict – 0% –** The text is a straightforward, factual news report detailing a tragic incident and the relevant background information. It relies on documented evidence (incident reports, 911 call transcripts, official statements) and presents information chronologically and neutrally. There is no discernible attempt to persuade the reader towards a specific viewpoint, ideology, or course of action beyond informing them of the events. The language is descriptive and avoids emotional manipulation, loaded terms, logical fallacies, or any of the other listed propaganda techniques. Its purpose appears to be purely informational journalism.
