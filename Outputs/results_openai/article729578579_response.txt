**Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as name-calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, and bandwagon. These techniques are used to paint a negative picture of Pope Francis and suggest a widespread loss of trust in the Catholic Church. The presence of these techniques indicates a high likelihood that the text is propaganda, as it seeks to influence the reader's perception and emotions regarding the Pope and the Church. However, the text also provides detailed accounts and references, which may lend some credibility to its claims, preventing a higher certainty of it being purely propaganda.**
