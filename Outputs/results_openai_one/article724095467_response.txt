Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, obfuscation, and red herring. These elements suggest an intent to influence the reader's perception of the FBI and LVMPD's handling of the Las Vegas massacre investigation, making it likely that the text is propaganda. However, it does not employ all possible techniques, and some parts of the text present factual information, which slightly reduces the likelihood.
