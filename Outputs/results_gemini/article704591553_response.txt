1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the opposing group and its members with insulting terms such as “BDS agitators,” “BDS provocateurs,” “naysayers,” a “rancid character,” and “bigoted BDS provocateurs.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that the BDS movement is a hateful, anti-Semitic campaign is repeated throughout the text using various phrases like “pernicious campaign of hate,” “hate laced with blatant anti-Semitic overtones,” and “vitriolic BDS campaign.”

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use its own brief, memorable phrases to promote its message. It describes a slogan used by the opposition (“Democratize SSMU”) but does not employ this technique itself.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by describing a “toxic environment” that Jewish students must “endure on a daily basis” and by noting that a student was warned to “keep his Jewish identity secret lest he sabotage his chances.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively questions the credibility and stated intentions of the opposing group by stating, “But Democratize SSMU was anything but democratic.” It also casts doubt on the university's future actions: “Judging by past ‘investigations’... I am not optimistic.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses significant exaggeration by comparing the events at a Canadian university to one of history's greatest atrocities, stating the school was “suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the identity of a specific group to create solidarity, repeatedly mentioning the students were targeted because of their “Jewish identity,” their “links to Jewish groups,” and their ethnicity.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words intended to influence the reader, such as “pernicious,” “outrage,” “toxic,” “malevolent,” “ignominious,” “repulsive display,” and “vitriolic.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text explicitly disapproves of the opposition's actions by comparing them to a hated group, stating the events were “harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws.”

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. It frames the pro-Israel students as a targeted minority, not as part of a popular majority.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex event, claiming that “The toxic environment is due almost exclusively to an active and vocal presence of BDS agitators on campus,” ignoring other potential political, personal, or procedural factors in the student society conflict.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague or intentionally confusing. It is very direct in its accusations, naming specific individuals, groups, and events.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the support of authorities as evidence for its claims, citing the SSMU’s Judicial Board ruling, quoting the SSMU president Muna Tojiboeva, and mentioning that the events “sparked outrage among watchdog groups and politicians.”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: one is either on the side of the victimized Jewish and pro-Israel students or on the side of the “bigoted,” “malevolent” BDS movement. It leaves no room for nuance or alternative perspectives.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use stock phrases or clichés to shut down debate. It makes a very strong, albeit one-sided, argument.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the story of Igor Sadikov and his “punch a Zionist” tweet. While related to BDS at McGill, this specific incident is used to distract from the main narrative of the directors' ousting and serves to paint the entire opposition with the brush of violence.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that the opposition did not necessarily make. It sets up the "Democratize SSMU" movement's name and purpose as a straw man, claiming its real, sinister purpose was not democracy but to “seek the removal of Jewish and anti-BDS students.”

18. Whataboutism – No – The text is on the offensive, making accusations rather than deflecting them. It does not use the technique of responding to a charge with a counter-charge of hypocrisy.

***

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary goal is not to provide a balanced, objective report of events, but to persuade the reader to adopt an extremely negative view of the BDS movement by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques.

The piece constructs a one-sided narrative that presents the events in a stark black-and-white framework of good versus evil. It relies heavily on loaded and emotional language (“pernicious,” “malevolent,” “rancid character,” “leftist-fascist bigotry”) to provoke an emotional response rather than rational analysis.

Crucially, it uses some of the most powerful propaganda techniques available, including a direct comparison of the opposition’s actions to those of the Nazis (Reduction ad Hitlerum) and a causal oversimplification that attributes a complex campus political dispute solely to anti-Semitism. The author presents the motives of the "BDS activists" as unequivocally hateful without including any perspective, quotes, or alternative explanations from that side. The combination of name-calling, appeal to fear, and casting doubt on the opposition's credibility solidifies its nature as a persuasive piece designed to vilify an opponent rather than inform an audience.
