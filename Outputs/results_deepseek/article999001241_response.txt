### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is highly likely propaganda due to its systematic use of manipulative techniques to advance a specific narrative. Key indicators include:  
- **Fear-mongering**: Portrays migrants as an "undeterred" threat despite military barriers, invoking national security fears.  
- **Bias and loaded language**: Terms like "illegally" and "voter fraud" frame issues emotively without neutral context.  
- **Distraction/Repetition**: The irrelevant, triply repeated Jim Acosta poll diverts attention and artificially inflates engagement.  
- **Oversimplification & vagueness**: Reduces complex immigration/election issues to sinister, unsupported claims (e.g., "election meddling").  
- **Source bias**: The article is sourced from "Sons of Liberty Media" (a partisan outlet) and RT (state-funded Russian media), both known for ideological slanting.  
While it reports factual elements (e.g., caravan movement, Trump’s decree), these are embedded in a structure designed to provoke anxiety, distrust in institutions, and nationalist sentiment. The absence of counter-perspectives or verifiable data further signals propaganda intent. The 85% likelihood acknowledges minor factual content but emphasizes overwhelming manipulative framing.
