1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack the subjects, such as in the headline "Congress’ Top Cop: House Democratic Caucus Server VANISHED In Muslim Spy Ring Investigation" and the first line "Why was the ringleader of the widespread Muslim spy scandal just offered a plea deal?".

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" three times in a row.

3. Slogans – Yes – The headline itself acts as a brief, memorable, and alarming phrase: "Congress’ Top Cop: House Democratic Caucus Server VANISHED In Muslim Spy Ring Investigation".

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by asking leading questions about national security, such as, "Who has been exposed to blackmail and God knows what else? And how deeply has America been compromised?".

5. Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the credibility of the official investigation and the Democratic party's narrative. For example: "Why was the ringleader of the widespread Muslim spy scandal just offered a plea deal?".

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the potential crimes by labeling them "treason" while minimizing the actual charges the subject pleaded guilty to: "These crimes are treason and should be prosecuted as such. Break: Ex-Dem IT aide Imran Awan pleads guilty to loan application fraud in federal court".

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a threat to the country's integrity and security. For example: "And how deeply has America been compromised? These crimes are treason and should be prosecuted as such."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language to influence the reader's perception, such as "widespread Muslim spy scandal," "secret memo," and "egregious violations".

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler, the Nazis, or other similarly hated groups.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea; instead, it presents itself as an exposé of information that is being hidden from the public.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple, sinister cause (a cover-up of treason) for a complex legal case, dismissing the official charges as a distraction: "Bank fraud does not explain why the Awans were kicked off the House network concurrent with the urgent memo, which did not cite bank fraud."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague and unclear sourcing to imply a conspiracy without providing concrete evidence. For example: "Multiple sources connected to the investigation told TheDCNF" and "one official close to the CHA alleged."

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the support of officials as evidence, citing a "secret memo" from "Congress’s top law enforcement official, Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, along with Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko".

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: the official story that the case is about bank fraud, or the article's narrative that it is a massive treasonous cover-up. The poll about Brett Kavanaugh is also a literal example: "* Yes, he will be confirmed. No, he will not be confirmed."

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; rather, it uses rhetorical questions and allegations to provoke a specific line of thought.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces an entirely irrelevant poll about Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation in the middle of the article, distracting from the main topic.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the simplified argument that the case is *only* about bank fraud, an argument it sets up itself in order to knock it down and imply a deeper conspiracy: "Democrats have since claimed that the case is about nothing but bank fraud. Bank fraud does not explain why the Awans were kicked off the House network...".

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge an opponent with hypocrisy by deflecting criticism; it maintains a direct attack on the subjects of the article.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and comprehensive example of propaganda. It employs a vast majority of the listed techniques to construct a narrative that is not meant to inform, but to persuade the reader of a specific, highly conspiratorial viewpoint. The article uses name-calling ("Muslim spy ring") and loaded language to create an immediate negative emotional association. It stokes fear and doubt about national security and the integrity of government institutions. It builds its case on an appeal to authority (a "secret memo") while simultaneously using vagueness ("multiple sources") to hint at a deeper conspiracy. The piece presents a black-and-white fallacy, forcing a choice between a mundane explanation (bank fraud) and a treasonous cover-up, thereby oversimplifying a complex legal situation. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Kavanaugh poll) further demonstrates that the article's purpose is not journalistic integrity but audience manipulation and data capture. The combination of these techniques creates a powerful piece of persuasive, and therefore propagandistic, writing.
