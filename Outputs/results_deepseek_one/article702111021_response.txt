Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1. **Name calling – Yes** – Explanation: The text repeatedly uses the derogatory term "Kritarch" (a portmanteau implying "judge-tyrant") to label Judge Saris (e.g., "Kritarch Saris," "treasonous kritarch").  
2. **Repetition – Yes** – Explanation: The term "Kritarch" is repeated 5 times to reinforce the negative label.  
3. **Slogans – No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Build the Wall") are used. The text relies on narrative arguments.  
4. **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Explanation: Warns that Saris’s actions will allow illegal aliens to "disappear into the United States," implying a threat to national security/safety.  
5. **Doubt – Yes** – Explanation: Repeatedly questions Saris’s authority and legitimacy (e.g., "she has neither authority... nor any authority").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Explanation: Exaggerates Saris’s actions as "treasonous" and "sabotage," while minimizing judicial oversight as a "minor issue."  
7. **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to patriotism via the Constitution/U.S. law (e.g., "unwilling to submit... to the Constitution and the law").  
8. **Loaded Language – Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged terms like "treasonous," "hunger for power," "sabotage," and "Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty" (implying illegitimacy).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis or historically despised groups.  
10. **Bandwagon – No** – Explanation: Does not appeal to the popularity of the stance.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification – No** – Explanation: No oversimplified cause-effect claims (complex legal arguments are cited).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – Explanation: Arguments are direct; legal references (e.g., U.S. Code §1226) add specificity.  
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Explanation: Cites U.S. Code §1226 as absolute legal authority (e.g., "the law is quite clear... gives such authority to the Executive Branch").  
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Explanation: Presents a binary: Saris either follows the law exactly or is "treasonous" (e.g., "she has neither authority... nor any authority").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – Explanation: No phrases like "case closed" to halt debate; uses detailed accusations.  
16. **Red herring – Yes** – Explanation: Irrelevant mention of the 9th Circuit’s reversal rate ("as frequently as 9th Circuit Judges do") distracts from Saris’s specific case.  
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Explanation: Misrepresents Saris’s judicial review as an attempt to "continue the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty," which she never claimed.  
18. **Whataboutism – No** – Explanation: Does not accuse Saris of hypocrisy by contrasting her actions with another’s.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It systematically employs **name-calling** ("Kritarch," "treasonous"), **loaded language** ("sabotage," "hunger for power"), and **fear appeals** (illegal aliens "disappear" into the U.S.) to vilify Judge Saris. It uses **doubt** and **black/white fallacies** to delegitimize her authority while **appealing to patriotic symbols** (Constitution, U.S. Code) to frame dissent as un-American. Though it cites legal sources, these are weaponized selectively (**appeal to authority**) to support a one-sided narrative, ignoring nuances of judicial review. The **straw man** distortion and **red herring** (9th Circuit reference) further reveal an agenda to provoke outrage rather than inform. The tone is polemical, aiming to rally support for impeachment through emotional manipulation rather than balanced analysis.
