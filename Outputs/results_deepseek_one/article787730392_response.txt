Below is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the given text, followed by a final verdict:

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling – Yes** – "New Mexico Jihadis" (headline) uses the inflammatory label "Jihadis" to attack the subjects.  
2. **Repetition – Yes** – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley..." repeats three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans – No** – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Build the Wall") are used.  
4. **Appeal to fear – No** – The text reports facts (e.g., "violent attacks") but does not exploit fear to push an agenda.  
5. **Doubt – Yes** – The defense attorney claims charges are motivated by "racial and religious prejudice," questioning prosecutors' credibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – The Editor’s Note minimizes potential Christian extremism: "If they were white, devout Christians... it would have never taken place."  
7. **Flag-Waving – No** – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language – Yes** – "Jihadis," "malnourished children," and "squalid conditions" evoke strong emotions/stereotypes.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon – No** – No appeal to an idea’s popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – The defense attorney oversimplifies the case’s scrutiny to race/religion: "If these were white Christians... No one would bat an eye."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is direct; no unclear expressions.  
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – Quotes from officials (e.g., FBI) are factual citations, not manipulative appeals.  
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – The defense attorney frames the issue as solely about race/religion: "They look different and worship differently" implies no other factors matter.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "That’s not a big deal" (regarding Christian gun ownership) shuts down critical discussion.  
16. **Red herring – Yes** – The Nikki Haley poll is irrelevant to the main story and distracts readers.  
17. **Straw men – Yes** – The defense attorney refutes an unstated argument: "If these were white Christians... that’s not a big deal," implying critics oppose gun rights/religion.  
18. **Whataboutism – Yes** – The core argument charges hypocrisy: "If these were white Christians... no one would care," deflecting from the crimes.  

### Verdict – 85% – 
**Explanation:** The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements, primarily through its framing, selective emphasis, and use of multiple techniques (e.g., Name Calling, Whataboutism, Red Herring). The headline’s use of "Jihadis" immediately sets a biased tone, while the defense attorney’s arguments oversimplify systemic issues and divert attention via Whataboutism. The Editor’s Note minimizes white Christian extremism, and the repetitive, irrelevant poll serves as a distraction. However, the inclusion of factual reporting (e.g., court details, quotes from officials) prevents it from being 100% propaganda. The text’s goal is clearly to sway readers by emphasizing perceived double standards and racial/religious bias, aligning with propaganda’s function to promote a specific worldview.
