Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against the subject (the asteroid) or anyone else. "Potentially hazardous" is a scientific classification, not an insult.
2.  **Repetition** – No – While "potentially hazardous" appears twice, this does not constitute a deliberate, repetitive hammering of the *same core message* throughout the text. It's mentioned as part of the asteroid's official status.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed for easy recall and emotional impact are used (e.g., no "Better dead than red", "Make America Great Again" equivalents).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the asteroid is called "potentially hazardous", the text immediately provides context minimizing fear: it will miss Earth, the distance is large (27x lunar distance), and closer flybys have happened recently. There's no attempt to instill fear to support a specific idea or action.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The credibility of scientists, NASA, or the Minor Planet Center is not questioned.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The description of the asteroid's size ("three-mile-wide"), distance ("6.5 million miles", "27 times the distance of the moon"), and visibility ("potentially detectable for three weeks") appears factual and measured. The "potentially hazardous" classification is explained contextually.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is largely neutral and descriptive. "Potentially hazardous" is a technical term. "Spectacular show" is positive but descriptive of a meteor shower, not emotionally manipulative in a propagandistic sense within this context.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No idea is disapproved of by linking it to a hated group.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea to encourage acceptance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text reports facts (the asteroid's approach, its classification, its relation to the meteor shower) without attributing complex events to simple causes.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific: it provides the asteroid's name, size, distance, classification reason, discovery date, relation to a meteor shower, visibility window, and observation plans. Terms like "relatively close" are immediately qualified with concrete figures.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While NASA and the Minor Planet Center are cited as sources of information and classification, their statements are presented as factual reports ("classified as", "According to NASA") rather than using their authority as the *primary evidence* to compel belief in a debatable claim. The text doesn't say "Believe X *because* NASA says so" about a controversial point.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents factual information about the asteroid and meteor shower. No false dilemmas (only two choices) are presented.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking or discussion (e.g., "it is what it is", "trust the science" used dismissively). The text invites observation ("be sure to look out").
16. **Red herring** – No – All information presented is relevant to the topic of asteroid 3200 Phaethon, its approach, classification, scientific interest, and related meteor shower. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – No opposing arguments are presented, let alone misrepresented ones to refute.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy are made against any opponent.

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is overwhelmingly factual and informational. It reports on the asteroid's approach using specific data (size, distance, classification criteria), explains its scientific significance (relation to the Geminids, observation plans), and provides practical information for observers. The headline's use of "skim by" and "days before Christmas" adds mild sensationalism common in news headlines to attract readers, and the inclusion of the technical term "potentially hazardous" might cause initial alarm, but the text itself immediately and thoroughly provides context that minimizes fear and focuses on scientific interest and observation opportunities. There is no discernible agenda beyond informing the public about an astronomical event. The slight sensationalism in the headline bumps the likelihood slightly above 0%, but the body of the text is not propagandistic.
