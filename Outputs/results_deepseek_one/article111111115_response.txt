### Verdict – 10% – Explanation  
The text is **not propaganda** but a factual report listing sexual misconduct allegations against Sen. Franken. It balances accusations with his denials, cites specific sources (e.g., HuffPost, Politico), and avoids overt persuasion tactics. The 10% likelihood acknowledges:  
- **Loaded language** (e.g., "forcibly kissed") and **bandwagon** (mentioning Senate pressure) subtly frame the narrative.  
- However, these do not dominate the text, which prioritizes neutrality: it details events chronologically, includes Franken’s rebuttals, and lacks inflammatory rhetoric or ideological appeals. Its primary function is **informational**, not manipulative.
