Based on a detailed analysis of the provided text against the definitions of the 18 propaganda techniques, here is the assessment for each technique, followed by the final verdict:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "well-documented liars" (referring to Democrats/politicians), "Trump-hating woman" (referring to Christine Ford).
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "Drain the Swamp" is used as a memorable phrase associated with Trump's agenda.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "next time a man is nominated... people will be that much less likely to believe his accuser... you have successfully made it much easier for a real sex offender" (fear that false accusations will harm real victims).
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "why come forward now?", "She can produce exactly zero witnesses", "it’s far too suspicious to lend it any credibility", "Way to go!" (sarcasm), "convince her to say" (all casting doubt on Ford's allegation and motives).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration: "every time there's a man... some woman crawls out... and makes an ambiguous-at-best claim". Minimization: Describing the allegation as an "ambiguous-at-best claim" and a "pathetic attempt at a smear campaign".
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – "As an outsider, a regular Joe American" (appeals to American identity and common man sentiment).
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "devastating", "kicked and scream and lie and pout", "well-documented liars", "pathetic attempt", "smear campaign", "furious", "dig up", "noise" (emotionally charged words and phrases).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No explicit comparison of opponents or their ideas to Nazis or universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon – Yes** – "Currently, there's more Republicans in Congress than Democrats, which means the guy will be confirmed" (implying siding with the winning/majority view).
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Reducing the complex allegation and political situation to a simple cause: a deliberate Democratic strategy solely to delay the vote until after the election ("All they have to do is delay... So, they dig up... convince her...").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The arguments, while biased, are presented relatively directly. Terms like "dozens of other circumstances" are vague, but the core accusations (timing, politics, lack of witnesses) are stated clearly.
13. **Appeal to authority – Weak/No** – Mentions FBI investigations ("investigated by the FBI six times") and character witnesses ("75 women publicly vouching") as bolstering Kavanaugh's credibility, but the primary argument isn't *based* on citing an authority figure's support. The text relies more on attacking the accuser's credibility and motives.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – "These are the facts. This is not my opinion. Everything else is just noise" (dismisses all other perspectives or complexities as irrelevant).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "These are the facts. This is not my opinion. Everything else is just noise" (used to shut down critical examination of the claims).
16. **Red herring – Yes** – The entire section about the Nikki Haley poll and its associated text ("take our poll...", "Completing this poll grants you access...") is completely irrelevant to the main topic of Kavanaugh's nomination and the allegations.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – "Ladies, you demand to be believed, no matter what" (misrepresents the #MeToo or "believe women" stance as demanding belief without evidence or process, which is not its core principle).
18. **Whataboutism – No** – While attacking the motives of Democrats and Ford, the text doesn't primarily deflect criticism by charging opponents with hypocrisy related to past actions.

**Verdict – 90% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda.** The analysis reveals the consistent use of numerous classic propaganda techniques designed to persuade and manipulate rather than inform objectively. Key indicators include:
*   **Heavy Reliance on Emotional Appeals:** Extensive use of Name Calling, Loaded Language, and Appeal to Fear to generate anger and distrust towards the accuser and Democrats.
*   **Undermining Opposition:** Systematic use of Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Straw Man, and Causal Oversimplification to dismiss the allegation as illegitimate and purely politically motivated.
*   **Discouraging Critical Thought:** Use of Black & White Fallacy and Thought-Terminating Clichés to frame the author's interpretation as the only valid "facts" and dismiss alternative perspectives as "noise".
*   **Simplification & Polarization:** Bandwagon and Flag-Waving are used to simplify the complex situation into an "us vs. them" narrative (Republicans/regular Americans vs. Democrats/lying establishment), while the core argument relies on a Causal Oversimplification.
*   **Distraction:** Inclusion of a clear Red Herring (the Nikki Haley poll).
*   **Purpose:** The overall structure and techniques serve the clear purpose of defending Kavanaugh, discrediting his accuser and the Democratic opposition, and rallying support for the nomination by appealing to pre-existing biases and emotions rather than presenting a balanced examination of the facts. While it presents arguments, the pervasive use of manipulative techniques marks it as propaganda.
