Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "perverts" (referring to clergy), "predators" (e.g., "predators like Theodore McCarrick"), "fifth columnists" (referring to internal critics of Vatican II), and "aggiornamentistas" (used pejoratively for supporters of modernization).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No single phrase or idea is repeated verbatim throughout the text. Themes recur but not as defined repetition.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable rallying phrases (e.g., no equivalents to "Build the Wall").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings like "the gates of Hell will not prevail against the Church... But they won’t stop trying" and descriptions of "demonic" influence, "tear down the walls from within," and the Church becoming "lecherous and pathetic" instill fear about the Church’s destruction.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "How was he allowed to go on molesting...?" and "How was such a depraved individual ordained...?" cast doubt on Church leadership’s integrity.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimization: Downplays McCarrick’s abuse by noting victims were "overwhelmingly above the age of consent" (contrasting with pedophilia). Exaggeration: Vatican II is portrayed as the singular root of all modern Church crises ("Something went critically wrong during Vatican II").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to Catholic identity: "As Catholics, we ask St. Michael...", references to "Holy Mother" (the Church), and framing issues as battles for tradition against modern corruption.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms: "demonic," "perverse appetites," "depraved," "lecherous and pathetic," "evil spirits," "burn her wheat as she gathers the chaff."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or Vichy collaborators.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames Vatican II for all modern problems: "Where did those fifth columnists enter? Why, there’s only one possible explanation: the Second Vatican Council."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct, not obscured (e.g., "spirit of Vatican II" is criticized but defined as modernization).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites St. Pope John XXIII, Pope Paul IV, and scripture ("as Our Lord promised") to legitimize claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents Vatican II as purely destructive vs. idealized pre-Vatican II tradition: "All the Church’s problems would be solved if we’d just go back to the Latin Mass" (dismissed as insufficient, but reinforces a binary).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" used to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – Focus remains on Vatican II; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Criticizes real positions (e.g., pro-modernization views are directly quoted/described).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Does not accuse critics of hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 90% –**  
The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs multiple techniques—including **name-calling**, **appeal to fear**, **loaded language**, **causal oversimplification**, and **black-and-white fallacy**—to advance a polemical agenda against Vatican II. It attributes complex issues (clergy abuse, Church modernization) to a single cause (Vatican II), uses emotionally charged demonization (e.g., "demonic," "perverts"), and frames dissent as a battle between absolute good (tradition) and evil (modernity). While it contains factual elements (e.g., McCarrick’s abuse), its selective evidence, lack of nuance, and relentless vilification of opposing viewpoints align with propaganda’s goal of provoking an emotional response (outrage toward Vatican II) rather than balanced analysis. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges the text’s grounding in real events, but its rhetorical execution overwhelmingly serves a persuasive, ideological purpose.
