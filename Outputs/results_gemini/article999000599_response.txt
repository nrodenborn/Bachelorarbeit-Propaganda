Name calling – Yes – The author labels Hillary Clinton a “paragon of political-correctness” and “queen of virtue-signaling opportunism,” which are insulting labels intended to attack her character.
Repetition – No – The text does not repeat the same message or phrase multiple times to drill it into the audience.
Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief, memorable phrase as a slogan to encapsulate an idea.
Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear in the audience about alternatives to its viewpoint.
Doubt – Yes – The article is structured to cast doubt on Hillary Clinton’s sincerity by contrasting her statements on politeness and diversity with her joke, thereby questioning her credibility.
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author describes Clinton as the “queen of virtue-signaling opportunism” and the audience as “apparently mind-numbed,” which are exaggerations used to strengthen the negative portrayal.
Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a political identity by framing the issue as a case of “progressive privilege,” rallying those who identify as being opposed to this perceived double standard.
Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “queen of virtue-signaling opportunism,” “hypocritically,” “mind-numbed audience,” and “progressive privilege” to evoke strong negative feelings towards the subject.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or the Nazi party.
Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is correct because it is popular; in fact, it implies the opposite by criticizing the “mind-numbed audience.”
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text concludes that the sole reason Clinton is not condemned is her “progressive privilege,” which is a simple cause offered for the complex issue of public and media reactions to politicians' gaffes.
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its criticism; it does not use vague or obscure language to confuse the audience.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The article cites and praises Kyle Olsen of The American Mirror, presenting his conclusion “so eloquently” as an authoritative final word to bolster its own argument.
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text creates a false dichotomy with the question “what would have happened if Trump said it?”, implying the only two possibilities are a hypocritical double standard or equal treatment. It also presents the outcome as either getting the ‘Roseanne treatment’ or being protected by privilege.
Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The rhetorical question “what would have happened if Trump said it?” functions as a thought-terminating device, designed to shut down nuanced discussion and direct the reader to a simple conclusion about media hypocrisy.
Red herring – Yes – The question “what would have happened if Trump said it?” distracts from the primary subject (Clinton’s comment) by introducing an irrelevant comparison to shift the focus to media bias and away from the act itself.
Straw men – No – The text attacks Hillary Clinton’s character directly rather than misrepresenting and then refuting a specific argument she or her defenders might have made.
Whataboutism – Yes – The question “what would have happened if Trump said it?” is a clear example of whataboutism, deflecting from Clinton’s actions by charging the media and her critics with the hypocrisy of a double standard.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to objectively report on an event, but to persuade the audience to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint of Hillary Clinton and the political ideology she represents. The article employs a high density of propaganda techniques to achieve this. It begins with name-calling and loaded language to establish a negative emotional frame. It then constructs a narrative of hypocrisy by selectively quoting Clinton, first on diversity and then her joke, to cast doubt on her character. The core of its persuasive effort relies on whataboutism, red herring, and the black & white fallacy, encapsulated in the question "what would have happened if Trump said it?". This question is not meant to be analyzed but to provoke outrage and reinforce a belief in a political double standard, a conclusion it supports with causal oversimplification ("progressive privilege") and an appeal to authority (quoting Kyle Olsen). The sheer number of manipulative techniques used demonstrates that the author's intent is to inflame and persuade rather than to inform.
