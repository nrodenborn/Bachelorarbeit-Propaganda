Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "disgraced FBI figures Peter Strzok and Lisa Page." The label "disgraced" is an insulting term attacking their character.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: No specific phrase or message is repeated insistently throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable rallying cry or slogan is used in the text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – Explanation: The text reports actions and statements but does not explicitly try to instill fear about alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Carter Page states the investigation was "so incredibly stupid to begin with" and made a "mockery... of the Constitution," directly questioning the credibility and legitimacy of the FBI investigation and the DOJ/DNC.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Carter Page calling the investigation "so incredibly stupid" minimizes its seriousness and legitimacy. The phrase "probably panicking" minimizes/speculates about the Democrats' reaction.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: While the Constitution is mentioned, it's not used as a direct patriotic appeal to support a specific action or idea within the text's own argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Words like "disgraced," "stupid," "mockery," "wrongdoing," and "panicking" carry strong negative connotations and appeal to emotion.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No association with Nazis, Hitler, or universally despised groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not appeal to the popularity of the idea of declassification or the claims about the investigation.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text reports events and statements but does not attribute a complex situation (like the investigation or Russian interference) to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is relatively straightforward in reporting the order and the documents involved, though details about content are sparse (as expected in reporting on classified material). It doesn't appear deliberately confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Quotes from Carter Page and Sarah Sanders are used to support the narrative surrounding the investigation and the declassification order. Page's statement carries weight as someone investigated, and Sanders speaks officially for the White House.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not present the situation as having only two possible sides or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: No phrases are used that inherently shut down critical thinking or discussion (e.g., "it is what it is," "that's just common sense" applied uncritically).
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the declassification order, the documents involved, and reactions to the investigation. It does not introduce a significant irrelevant topic to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that wasn't actually made by opponents.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not accuse critics (like Democrats) of hypocrisy by pointing to their own alleged misdeeds.

**Verdict – 60% –** The text exhibits clear elements of propaganda, primarily through **Name Calling** ("disgraced FBI figures"), **Doubt** (casting strong aspersions on the investigation's validity via Carter Page), **Exaggeration/Minimization** (calling the investigation "incredibly stupid" and speculating Democrats are "panicking"), **Loaded Language** ("disgraced," "stupid," "mockery," "wrongdoing," "panicking"), and **Appeal to Authority** (using Carter Page's quotes to validate the criticism). These techniques frame the investigation negatively and those involved in it (Strzok, Page, DOJ, FBI, DNC) as disreputable or incompetent, while portraying Trump's declassification order positively as promoting transparency. However, the text also reports factual developments (the order, the documents specified, Sanders' statement, DOJ compliance) and attributes opinions clearly to sources (Carter Page, Fox source). This factual reporting component prevents it from being purely (100%) propaganda, but the selective use of charged language and sources clearly pushes a specific narrative, resulting in a significant likelihood (60%) of the text functioning as propaganda.
