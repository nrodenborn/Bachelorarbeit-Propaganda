Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Senator Graham calling the Democrats' actions the "most unethical sham".

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – Yes – The phrase "most unethical sham" is used as a brief and memorable phrase to characterize the Democrats' actions.

Appeal to fear – Yes – Senator Graham is quoted as saying, "Boy, y'all want power. Boy, I hope you never get it," which suggests a negative future if the Democrats were to gain power.

Doubt – No – The text does not primarily question credibility in a subtle way; it makes direct and firm accusations. For instance, it states Dr. Ford has "no evidence" rather than questioning if her evidence is credible.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline uses "Unleashes Firestorm," which is an exaggeration of a senator giving a speech. The text also describes the Democrats' actions as a "relentless assault."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text quotes Senator Graham appealing to "the American people" to "see through this sham," which is an appeal to a national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like "Unleashes Firestorm," "relentless assault," and "blasted Democrats."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or group to the Nazis or other groups hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – Yes – The author states that Graham "said what many of us thought should have been said" and "what everyone had been waiting on," suggesting that this viewpoint is the popular one.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text quotes Graham simplifying the Democrats' motives to a single cause: "What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and point of view; it does not use intentionally vague or obscure language.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The entire premise of the article is that Senator Lindsey Graham, an authority figure, was "right on point," and his words are presented as evidence of the Democrats' wrongdoing.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a binary choice: either you believe the Democrats and Dr. Ford (who have "no evidence") or you believe Kavanaugh and the witnesses who "refute her claims," leaving no room for nuance.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down debate; it makes direct arguments, however biased they may be.

Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of a poll asking "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is completely irrelevant to the topic of the Kavanaugh hearing and serves as a distraction and data-gathering tool.

Straw men – Yes – The text presents the Democrats' position as a simple desire to "destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020," which is a simplified and easily attackable caricature (a straw man) of their actual, more complex motivations and arguments.

Whataboutism – No – The text attacks the Democrats but does not charge them with hypocrisy by pointing to a similar past transgression.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast number of propaganda techniques to promote a specific political viewpoint rather than provide a neutral account of events. The piece is framed with highly emotional and biased language from the headline onward (Loaded Language, Exaggeration, Name Calling). It constructs a simple, two-sided narrative (Black & White Fallacy) that paints Senator Graham and Judge Kavanaugh as victims and heroes, while portraying the Democrats as a monolithic group driven by a single, cynical motive (Causal Oversimplification, Straw Man). The author attempts to create a sense of consensus and correctness by appealing to a silent majority (Bandwagon) and a national identity (Flag-Waving). The inclusion of a completely irrelevant poll (Red Herring) further demonstrates that the article's purpose extends beyond information into engagement and data collection, which are hallmarks of modern political propaganda outlets. The sheer density and variety of these techniques indicate a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions.
