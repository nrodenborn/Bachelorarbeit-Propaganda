1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents with insulting terms, such as calling Rod Rosenstein a "Deep State DOJ tool" and the entire investigation a "witch hunt" and a "hoax".

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly pushes the central message that a "Deep State" is conspiring to hide the truth from the public and that President Trump is fighting for transparency. This idea is the core theme and is reiterated throughout the article in different phrasings.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the brief, memorable, and dismissive phrase "witch hunt" to characterize the entire investigation. Example: "in what has become a two year, multi-million dollar witch hunt".

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text attempts to instill fear of a powerful, unelected group secretly running the government. Example: "The Duran’s Alex Christoforou and Editor-in-Chief Alexander Mercouris discuss the insurrection taking place at the US Department of Justice". The word "insurrection" suggests a dangerous and unlawful uprising against the constitutional order.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is designed to make the reader question the credibility and motives of the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the entire Russia investigation. Example: "This is all you need to know about the hoax that was and is Trump-Russia collusion and the Robert Mueller special counsel investigation."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the actions of government officials by calling their procedural review an "insurrection". Example: "Deep State Insurrection Defying POTUS Trump’s Order".

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as the President, acting under the "US Constitution", fighting for the rights of "every American citizen" against a secretive internal enemy. Example: "The US President wants every American citizen to see the full, unredacted version of the FISA documents".

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words designed to influence the reader. Example: "Deep State officials like ex-CIA chief John Brennan are in panic mode." The phrases "panic mode," "insurrection," and "hoax" are all examples of loaded language.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or group to the Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular or that the reader should join a majority.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a highly complex situation involving intelligence gathering, legal oversight, and inter-branch politics as a simple struggle caused by a "Deep State" conspiracy to hide a "hoax". Example: "This is all you need to know about the hoax that was and is Trump-Russia collusion and the Robert Mueller special counsel investigation."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The term "Deep State" is used repeatedly without a clear definition, creating a vague, shadowy enemy that can encompass any person or agency the author wishes to target. Example: "Deep State officials like ex-CIA chief John Brennan are in panic mode."

13. Appeal to authority – No – The text mentions authorities (like the DOJ spokesman and top Democrats) but only to frame them as part of the opposition or conspiracy, not to use their authority as evidence to support its own claims.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either you support President Trump's demand for "full transparency," or you are part of the "Deep State" conspiracy to hide the "truth" from the American public. It ignores any potential middle ground, such as legitimate national security concerns about releasing classified information.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a phrase to discourage further thought and cement its conclusion. Example: "This is all you need to know about the hoax that was and is Trump-Russia collusion and the Robert Mueller special counsel investigation." This phrase tells the reader that the issue is simple and has been fully explained, so no further critical thought is necessary.

16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on its central argument about the declassification of documents and the alleged "Deep State" conspiracy; it does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the audience.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the Democrats' position by stating they are calling "the act of releasing documents criminal." The quoted letter shows their argument is more nuanced, expressing "profound alarm" at the President intervening in an investigation that may implicate him and asking for a briefing, not blanket opposition to declassification itself.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text attacks opponents directly but does not try to deflect criticism of Trump by accusing his opponents of hypocrisy for a similar past offense.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. The article uses a narrative framework of good versus evil, pitting a transparent President fighting for the "American citizen" against a sinister, vague "Deep State" engaged in an "insurrection." This is achieved through constant use of name-calling ("tool," "witch hunt"), loaded language ("panic mode," "hoax"), and appeals to fear. It presents a black-and-white fallacy where no middle ground or legitimate counter-argument (like national security concerns) is considered, and it oversimplifies a complex legal and political issue into a simple conspiracy. While it includes factual elements, such as quoting a Bloomberg article and a letter from Democrats, these facts are framed and interpreted entirely through the lens of propaganda to manipulate the reader's perception of events.
