1. Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack the subject; it uses factual information from a police report (e.g., "suspect," "charged with two counts of aggravated murder") to frame its narrative.
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message about the racial dynamic of the crime and the media's alleged failure to report it is repeated. The author first notes the lack of a picture, then confirms the suspect is black, then explicitly states the case belongs in the "Black Murders Of White Cops" and "Not Reporting Race" categories, and finally reiterates the point by contrasting it with a hypothetical scenario.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to rally support. The category titles are descriptive of the author's agenda but are not used as slogans within the text.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text appeals to fear by creating a special category, "Black Murders Of White Cops," which frames the event not as an isolated crime but as part of a frightening racial pattern, intended to stoke fear and anxiety in its target audience.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built around casting doubt on the credibility of the news media by suggesting they are deliberately hiding the racial component of the crime. The line "also in our 'Not Reporting Race' category, since except for the photograph, there's no mention of the race issue" is a direct attempt to make the reader question the media's motives.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the significance of the media not explicitly stating the suspect's race in the text of the article, framing it as a deliberate and conspiratorial omission ("Not Reporting Race") rather than a standard journalistic practice, especially when a photograph is provided.
7. Flag-Waving – No – While the text quotes a police chief calling the officers "true American heroes," the author's own argument does not use patriotism to make its point; its focus is on race.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The phrase "Black Murders Of White Cops" is extremely loaded. It is not neutral; it is designed to evoke a strong emotional response based on racial identity and stereotypes. The parenthetical "(Most people named Quentin Lamar Smith are black, by the way.)" also uses a stereotype to make its point.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparison to Hitler or Nazism.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its idea is correct because it is popular. In fact, it positions itself as revealing a truth that the mainstream is ignoring.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author implies a simple cause (media bias against whites) for a complex issue (how and when news outlets report on race in crime stories). It ignores other potential factors like journalistic standards, legal considerations, or the idea that a photo makes a racial descriptor redundant.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's goal is to be very clear and direct about their specific point regarding the racial angle of the crime.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The author cites news reports and police statements as sources of fact, but their own argument (about media bias) is not based on an appeal to an authority figure's opinion.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false binary: either the media is deliberately hiding the race of the black suspect, or, in a hypothetical reversed scenario, they would be loudly proclaiming it. This ignores a range of other possibilities and nuances in journalistic decisions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; it actively tries to provoke a specific line of thought.
16. Red herring – No – The author remains focused on their central point about the racial aspect of the crime and the media's coverage of it. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. Straw men – Yes – The final sentence refutes an argument that was not presented: "If these two men had survived, and Quentin Lamar Smith had died, you'd be hearing a lot about the race issue." The author creates a hypothetical media reaction (a straw man) and attacks it to make their point about media hypocrisy seem stronger.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The final sentence is a form of whataboutism. It deflects from the specifics of the current case by saying, "But what about this other hypothetical case?" to charge the media with hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. While it is structured around a factual news report, its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, racially charged worldview. The author selectively curates information and frames it to fit a pre-existing narrative, which is evident from the blog's own categories: "Black Murders Of White Cops" and "Not Reporting Race." The piece heavily employs propaganda techniques such as loaded language, appeal to fear, and casting doubt on the media to create a narrative of a conspiracy of silence around crimes committed by Black individuals against white victims. It uses logical fallacies like the straw man, whataboutism, and the black & white fallacy to reinforce its point about media hypocrisy without evidence. The goal is to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions to promote a divisive racial agenda, which is the essence of propaganda.
