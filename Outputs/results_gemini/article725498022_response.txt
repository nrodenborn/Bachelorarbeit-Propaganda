1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels for subjects, for example, referring to Monsignor Battista Ricca as a “notorious homosexual,” describing protesters as “foolish” (in a quote from the pope), and quoting a description of the St. Gallen Group as a “mafia” to associate the Pope with a negatively-perceived group.

2. Repetition – Yes – The central idea that Pope Francis is failing on the sex abuse issue, protecting abusers, and dismantling his predecessor's work is repeated throughout the text. For instance, the pope’s “calumny” comment and his claim of “no evidence” are mentioned multiple times to reinforce the central argument.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text highlights slogans used by protesters, such as “Ni zurdos, ni tontos,” (Neither lefties nor stupid), to demonstrate public opposition.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear by suggesting Pope Francis is dismantling the systems put in place to protect children from abuse, implying that the Church is becoming less safe under his leadership. It details the actions of abusers and alleges the pope is lenient, instilling fear that these crimes will go unpunished.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is structured to cast doubt on Pope Francis's credibility. For example, it questions his apology by describing it as “touted – though somewhat skeptically – as a ‘contrite’ papal apology” and immediately points out how he “doubled down” on his original position.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the negative aspects of the pontificate, describing it as “an apparently unending stream of outrages and embarrassments.” It also minimizes the pope’s apology by framing it as insincere and immediately followed by a doubling-down of his original stance.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific Catholic identity by framing the issue as a crisis for the Church and its faithful. It contrasts Pope Francis’s actions with those of his predecessor, Pope Benedict, appealing to a sense of what is “correct” for the Church, as when it quotes a priest saying, “We need a bishop who’s credible.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as “unending stream of outrages and embarrassments,” “sinister appearance,” “pederast predator,” and “shameful.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses a similar technique by associating the pope and his actions with groups the intended audience may dislike, such as “leftists,” a “secularist agenda,” and a “mafia” of liberal cardinals, to discredit him.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text uses a reverse bandwagon appeal by highlighting that the pope is losing support even among his supposed allies: “It seems the shine is coming off the papal penny among leftist secular journalists, his natural constituency.” This suggests that since everyone is turning against him, the reader should too.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex reasons for the pope’s actions by attributing them to a single, sinister motive: a deliberate effort to protect allies and dismantle his predecessor’s work. For example, it quotes a book suggesting the pope surrounds himself with “morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb” as a simple explanation for his appointments.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is not vague; its accusations are direct and specific. It accuses the pope of being vague, but the author’s own style is clear and pointed.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly cites authorities to support its claims, including journalists from the Boston Globe and National Catholic Reporter, a cardinal (“an astonishing public rebuke of the pope by Sean Cardinal O’Malley”), and a former member of the pope’s sex abuse commission, Marie Collins.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark contrast between Pope Francis (portrayed as weak on abuse and dismantling reforms) and his predecessor Pope Benedict (portrayed as strong and effective). This creates a false dichotomy that ignores the complexities and potential nuances of both pontificates.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use these clichés to make its own points. It does, however, quote Pope Francis using phrases that could be interpreted as such (e.g., “It is all calumny. Is that clear?”) to criticize him for attempting to shut down discussion.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces information that is irrelevant to the core argument about the abuse cover-up to prejudice the reader. For example, it repeatedly mentions the alleged or confirmed homosexuality of various figures (e.g., Monsignor Ricca, Juan Carlos Cruz), which is not relevant to the facts of the abuse but serves to appeal to potential biases in the audience.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the idea that Pope Francis is a reformer by implicitly setting up an oversimplified or extreme version of what a true reformer would do (e.g., acting without any process, never making a misstep) and then attacking him for failing to meet this unstated, unrealistic standard.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text repeatedly charges Pope Francis with hypocrisy. For example, it contrasts his stated commitment to “zero tolerance” for abuse with a long list of alleged actions to the contrary, such as his defense of Bishop Barros and his reversal of a sentence against another priest.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and powerful example of propaganda. While it is constructed around factual events and real quotes, its purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt an extremely negative view of Pope Francis. It achieves this by employing a vast majority of the propaganda techniques listed. The use of loaded language, constant casting of doubt, and appeals to authority are relentless. The entire piece is framed as a black & white fallacy, where Pope Francis’s actions are consistently portrayed as sinister and destructive, while those of his predecessor, Pope Benedict, are presented as effective and righteous. The article selectively presents facts and quotes that support its singular narrative while ignoring any potential counter-arguments or alternative interpretations. The cumulative effect of these techniques is a highly biased polemic designed to erode trust in its subject, which is the primary function of propaganda.
