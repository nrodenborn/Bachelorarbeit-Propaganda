Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to the primary subject (patients, plague, officials).
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message about patients escaping is stated, but not repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans within the text itself.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the danger and potential consequences: patients escaping could spread the plague further ("fears that the plague could spread even further"), the plague becoming antibiotic-resistant is "inevitable" leading to the healthcare system being "overwhelmed" and the disease having "control of the nation", and the potential for a "global pandemic" if it reaches the mainland.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not primarily question the credibility of institutions or individuals; it reports concerns and warnings.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – While the situation is serious, the reporting (based on cited sources like The Sun, Unicef, and SHTFplan) doesn't clearly exaggerate facts beyond the warnings given by those sources. Words like "shocking" and "terrifying" are emotive but reflect the cited perspectives.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national/group identity to support its points.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like "Shock", "ESCAPING" (in caps), "forcefully", "plague", "black death", "outbreak", "inevitable", "overwhelmed", "control of the nation", "much more terrifying", and "global pandemic" are used to evoke strong negative emotions (fear, alarm) beyond neutral description.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not argue for something based on its popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The spread is attributed to multiple factors (fear of hospitals/needles, burial practices, antibiotic resistance), not one simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text reports specific details (reasons for escape, burial tradition, antibiotic resistance warning) and attributes information to sources (The Sun, Unicef rep, SHTFplan).
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites The Sun newspaper, Jean Benoit Manhes (Unicef deputy representative), and Mac Slavo/SHTFplan to support its claims about patients escaping and the danger of antibiotic resistance.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents a complex situation with multiple aspects (medical, cultural, logistical) and doesn't reduce solutions or causes to only two stark choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used to shut down critical thought. The text invites consideration of the dangers presented.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the plague outbreak, patient behavior, cultural practices, and medical risks. No irrelevant topics are introduced.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument not actually made by an opponent.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse anyone of hypocrisy by referencing their past actions.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits strong characteristics of propaganda, primarily through its significant use of **Appeal to Fear** and **Loaded Language**. The headline ("SHOCK: Black Death Patients Are ESCAPING...") immediately sets a sensational and alarming tone. Words like "plague," "black death," "inevitable," "overwhelmed," "control of the nation," "much more terrifying," and "global pandemic" are deliberately chosen to maximize fear and anxiety in the reader. While it cites sources (Appeal to Authority) and reports on a real situation, the framing, emphasis, and highly emotive language go beyond objective reporting. The primary purpose appears to be to shock the audience and amplify the perceived threat level, manipulating emotional response rather than solely informing. The focus on the most extreme potential outcomes (nation controlled, global pandemic), presented as near-inevitable, further supports this propagandistic intent.
