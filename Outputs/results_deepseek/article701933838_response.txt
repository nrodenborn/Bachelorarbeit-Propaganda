Here's the analysis of the text based on the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against the subject or others.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message (removal of a fugitive) is stated clearly but not repeated excessively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used for persuasion (e.g., "Make America Safe").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While crimes (murder, rape, kidnapping) are mentioned in statistics, the text does not explicitly use these to instill fear against alternatives or support a broader policy idea.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of anyone or anything; it presents information as fact.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The information presented (specific case details, statistics) appears factual and proportional. No obvious overstatement or understatement is present.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Words like "unlawfully" (instead of "without authorization"), "fugitives," and "wanted for homicide/murder" carry strong negative connotations that appeal to emotion and reinforce a specific perspective on the subject and ICE's actions.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt is made to link ideas or groups to universally hated entities like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea or action.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text reports actions (arrest, removal) and circumstances (wanted in home country) without making simplistic causal claims about complex issues like crime or immigration.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is straightforward and factual, detailing the sequence of events and providing specific statistics. Language is clear.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text cites the authority of the "ICE Assistant Attaché for Removals in Guatemala" providing the lead and the "immigration judge" ordering removal as evidence supporting the legitimacy of the actions taken.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text does not present a complex issue with only two simplistic options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thought or discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the specific case and ICE's broader fugitive removal statistics; no irrelevant material is introduced.
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented arguments are presented or refuted.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are made against opponents or critics.

**Verdict – 15% –** The text is primarily a straightforward news release reporting a specific law enforcement action (the removal of a fugitive) and providing relevant context through statistics. Its primary purpose appears to be informational (announcing the removal) and institutional (highlighting ICE's enforcement role and results). However, it employs **Loaded Language** ("unlawfully," "fugitives," "wanted for homicide/murder") which frames the subject negatively and reinforces ICE's mission, and **Appeal to Authority** (citing the Attaché and the immigration judge) to bolster legitimacy. These elements introduce a subtle persuasive dimension typical of institutional PR, aiming to cast the agency's actions in a favorable, necessary, and legally sound light. The inclusion of statistics about criminal convictions among those removed also serves this institutional messaging goal. While these techniques push the text towards propaganda by selectively emphasizing certain facts and using emotionally charged terms to shape perception, the core remains factual reporting of an event within the agency's mandate. It lacks the strong emotional manipulation, deception, or overt ideological framing characteristic of high-propaganda content.
