Here are the propaganda techniques and whether they are used in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses insulting labels for its subjects, such as calling David Duke a "hatemonger" and Sofian Zakkout a "fan and propagator" of "toxic hate" and a "hatemonger" who engages in "hatemongering."
2.  Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly states its central message that Zakkout promotes bigotry. For example, it says he "has been promoting Duke’s bigoted work for many years," and later reiterates, "This was not the first time Zakkout has promoted David Duke. Indeed, he has done so for years."
3.  Slogans – No – The text reports on slogans used by others (e.g., "We are Hamas") but does not use a brief, memorable phrase of its own to advance its argument.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text connects Zakkout's promotion of David Duke to the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville: "At this same rally, a white nationalist plowed his car into a group of people who were protesting the rally, killing one." This instills fear by linking the ideology Zakkout promotes to lethal violence.
5.  Doubt – Yes – The text is designed to cast doubt on Zakkout's public image, stating that his positions on community boards provide a "facade of respectability" and that "In reality, he has done nothing to serve the community."
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by stating Zakkout has done "nothing to serve the community," an absolute claim that minimizes any potential positive actions to zero in order to strengthen the negative portrayal.
7.  Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its case.
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words intended to influence the reader, such as "bigoted," "venomous," "grotesque," "perfidious," and "toxic hate."
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of Zakkout by linking him to a group that promoted Hitler: "It was produced by The Realist Report, an anti-Jew, anti-black, anti-gay independent media outlet, which describes Hitler as ‘the greatest leader in modern Western history.’”
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does the opposite of a bandwagon appeal, stating that the issue "has been virtually ignored by everyone, save this author and his colleague," encouraging the reader to join a minority viewpoint, not a popular one.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not attempt to explain a complex event with a simple cause; rather, it focuses on documenting the specific actions of one individual.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is the opposite of vague; it is highly specific, providing names, dates, direct quotes, and sources to support its claims.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the "Anti-Defamation League (ADL)," a recognized authority on anti-Semitism, to support its claims: "the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a binary choice in its conclusion: "If people like David Duke and Louis Farrakhan can be condemned and repudiated for spreading their toxic hate, their fan and propagator Zakkout can and must be as well." This suggests that condemning Zakkout is the only logical and moral option.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; it actively provides detailed evidence to encourage the reader to think critically about the subject.
16. Red herring – No – All the information presented, however inflammatory, is directly relevant to the central argument that Sofian Zakkout promotes hate.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not invent and refute a weak argument. It directly addresses the potential counter-argument of Zakkout's "respectability" by presenting evidence against it.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism of itself by charging an opponent with hypocrisy. It makes direct accusations against its target.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the reader to adopt a strong negative opinion of Sofian Zakkout and to incite action against him ("It is time for Zakkout to be exposed and stripped of his public functions").

The piece systematically employs a wide array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. It relies heavily on **Name-calling** ("hatemonger") and **Loaded Language** ("venomous," "perfidious") to create an immediate emotional aversion to the subject. It uses **Appeal to Fear** by linking the subject's promoted ideology to a real-world murder. The argument is reinforced through **Repetition** of the central claim and strengthened by **Appeal to Authority** (citing the ADL). The author uses **Reduction ad Hitlerum** by connecting Zakkout to Nazi-sympathizing sources, one of the most powerful forms of association. Finally, it frames the issue as a **Black & White Fallacy**, leaving the reader with the impression that the only moral choice is to condemn Zakkout. While the text presents factual evidence (quotes, dates, links), this evidence is selected and framed within a powerful propagandistic structure designed to provoke outrage and eliminate any nuanced interpretation of the subject's character or actions.
