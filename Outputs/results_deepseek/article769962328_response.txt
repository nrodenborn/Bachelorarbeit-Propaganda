Below is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique, followed by a final verdict:

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – Examples: "counterfeits," "reprobates," "hypocrites," "paper tigers," and "enemies of the cross" are used to insult opponents.  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – Phrases like "Soldiers of the Cross" and "taking ground for the kingdom" serve as brief, memorable rallying cries.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings about "58 million babies murdered" and lawlessness imply dire consequences if opponents prevail.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions the credibility of "counterfeit" Christians and the media (e.g., "the media really attacked me... they are being exposed for who they are").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates abortion statistics ("58 million babies murdered") and minimizes opponents as "people pleasers" with "no absolutes."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to patriotism via "America’s values" and the US Constitution, framing dissent as un-American.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Uses emotionally charged terms like "abomination," "murdered," "lawlessness," and "reprobates."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Implies true Christians face persecution (e.g., "the world hates them"), suggesting alignment with the righteous "in-group."  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames societal decay solely on church compromise (e.g., "It is the church that has compromised, not the world").  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct, not deliberately obscure.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites biblical verses (e.g., John 14:6, Leviticus 18:22) and figures (Catherine Booth, John Calvin) as validation.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents a false dichotomy: "genuine Christians" (persecuted warriors) vs. "counterfeits" (compromised hypocrites).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Phrases like "enemies of the cross" and "paper tigers" shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The Kavanaugh poll distracts from the core religious argument with unrelated political speculation.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents opponents as avoiding confrontation (e.g., "they hide behind a microphone... fail to confront issues").  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy via "what about X" deflection.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic, employing 15 of the 18 techniques analyzed. It uses **emotional manipulation** (fear, loaded language), **us-vs-them framing** (genuine vs. counterfeit Christians), and **religious authority** to delegitimize dissent. Key indicators include:  
- **Dichotomous rhetoric**: Divides the world into righteous warriors ("Soldiers of the Cross") and villainous "counterfeits," leaving no middle ground.  
- **Fear-based persuasion**: Graphic abortion statistics and warnings of societal collapse pressure readers to adopt the author’s views.  
- **Identity reinforcement**: Appeals to Christian patriotism (e.g., Constitution, biblical values) and persecution narratives to solidify in-group loyalty.  
- **Distraction**: The Kavanaugh poll and personal anecdotes divert from substantive debate.  
- **Source bias**: Permission from "Sons of Liberty Media" (a known partisan outlet) underscores its agenda-driven messaging.  

The 5% uncertainty arises from the text’s overtly religious context, where terms like "abomination" may reflect doctrinal language rather than pure propaganda. However, the systematic use of demonization, oversimplification, and emotional triggers aligns dominantly with propaganda objectives: to persuade, not inform. The goal is to mobilize adherents against perceived enemies (secularism, compromise) by exploiting faith and fear.
