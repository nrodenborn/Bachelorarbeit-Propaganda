Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and whataboutism. These elements suggest a strong likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it employs emotional and rhetorical strategies to influence the reader's perception of the Trump-Kim summit. However, it does not utilize all the listed techniques, and some parts of the text provide factual information, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood.
