1. Name calling – Yes – The article labels the people creating theories as "crackpots" and "bonkers," and describes Laura Loomer as a "noxious far-right personality."
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly brings up Douglas Haig's engineering background and his LinkedIn profile as the central piece of evidence used by the conspiracy theorists ("Many of their theories lean heavily on Haig's LinkedIn profile," "pointed to Haig's background in the aerospace industry," "making hay with Haig's background in Arizona aerospace").
3. Slogans – Yes – Laura Loomer is quoted using the brief, memorable, and speculative phrase, "This is starting to look more and more like a gun running operation gone wrong every day."
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The conspiracy theories described in the text appeal to fear by suggesting a cover-up by the FBI and police and the existence of a "shadow government in the United States," which implies a hidden, powerful threat to the public.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text quotes Intellihub directly attempting to instill doubt: "However, don’t be fooled. Haig is likely a CIA cut-out..." It also quotes Jake Morphonios expressing doubt to create suspicion: "I've got some questions of my own about Doug Haig that I'm going to continue seeking answers for."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The conspiracy theories exaggerate Haig's importance, elevating him from a man who sold ammunition to a key figure in a government plot. Conversely, the article minimizes the significance of the sale by stating, "it should be noted that Haig's rounds were probably not even used in the massacre."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The conspiracy theories leverage patriotism and national identity by referencing "U.S. government involvement," the "FBI," and Haig's alleged "DOD Top secret clearance" to build their narrative of a state-level conspiracy.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The author uses emotionally charged words like "crackpots," "bonkers," "ludicrous," and "noxious" to frame the conspiracy theorists negatively. The term "mass murderer" is also used to describe Paddock, evoking a strong emotional response.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons or associations with Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not claim that the conspiracy theories are popular or that readers should believe them because many others do. It portrays the theorists as a fringe group.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The conspiracy theories reported in the text take the complex event of a mass shooting and reduce it to a simple, single cause: a "gun running operation gone wrong" or a plot involving "U.S. government involvement."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – Jake Morphonios is quoted using vague language to imply guilt without making a direct accusation: "Did he know something that Stephen Paddock was going to do? That I don't know — it's possible, but who knows."
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The conspiracy theorists are reported to use Haig's work history with authoritative organizations like "Boeing" and "Northrop Grumman," as well as his supposed "DOD Top secret clearance," as evidence for their claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The conspiracy theorists present a false dichotomy: either you believe the official story (which they frame as a lie) or you must accept their alternative theory as the truth. Intellihub's statement, "However, don’t be fooled. Haig is likely a CIA cut-out," encourages this binary thinking.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "However, don’t be fooled," as used by Intellihub, is a cliché designed to stop the audience from critically thinking about Haig's denial and to simply accept the conspiratorial alternative.
16. Red herring – Yes – The conspiracy theorists' focus on "helicopters lurking behind the Mandalay Bay" is an irrelevant detail introduced to distract from the established facts of the shooting and support a different, unsubstantiated narrative of an "air assault."
17. Straw men – Yes – The conspiracy theorists attack a straw man of the official narrative, portraying it as a deliberate cover-up for a massive "gun running operation." They refute this fabricated, complex plot rather than addressing the actual findings and unresolved questions of the real investigation.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not feature any examples of an individual deflecting a criticism by accusing their opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 30% – The text is primarily a news report *about* propaganda, rather than being a piece of propaganda itself. Its main purpose is to document and expose the propaganda techniques being used by conspiracy theorists against Douglas Haig. The vast majority of the propaganda techniques identified are from the conspiracy theorists being quoted and described. However, the article is not entirely neutral. The author uses propaganda techniques like Name Calling ("crackpots," "bonkers") and Loaded Language ("noxious," "ludicrous") to frame the conspiracy theorists in a negative light and persuade the reader to dismiss their claims. This use of persuasive, biased language pushes the article away from objective journalism and gives it propagandistic qualities, but its core function remains reportorial.
