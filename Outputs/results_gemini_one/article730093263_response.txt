Name calling – No – The text does not use an insulting label to attack the subject. It refers to the suspect by his name, Quentin Lamar Smith, and the officers by their names.

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the racial component of the crime. Examples include: "murder of two white Westerville, OH cops", "( Most people named Quentin Lamar Smith are black, by the way.)", "and he is black", and "Black Murders Of White Cops".

Slogans – Yes – The author uses brief, memorable phrases to categorize the event and encapsulate their viewpoint. Example: "This goes in our "Black Murders Of White Cops" category, and also in our "Not Reporting Race" category".

Appeal to fear – No – The text aims to generate anger and resentment towards the media, but it does not primarily support its idea by instilling fear in the audience about an alternative.

Doubt – Yes – The text explicitly questions the credibility and objectivity of the media. Example: "...and also in our "Not Reporting Race" category, since except for the photograph, there's no mention of the race issue."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the importance of the racial aspect of the crime while minimizing other contributing factors detailed in the report, such as the history of domestic violence. Example: The creation of the "Black Murders Of White Cops" category frames the entire event solely through a racial lens.

Flag-Waving – No – While the quoted police chief calls the officers "true American heroes," this is part of the embedded news report, and the author does not use patriotic appeals in their own commentary to persuade the audience.

Loaded Language – Yes – The author uses language to appeal to emotions and stereotypes. Example: "( Most people named Quentin Lamar Smith are black, by the way.)" This parenthetical comment relies on a stereotype associated with names to pre-emptively racialize the suspect.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular or that the reader should adopt it because many others do. It presents itself as a counter-narrative.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author simplifies the media's lack of racial commentary into a single cause: a deliberate cover-up. Example: The creation of the "Not Reporting Race" category implies a simple, malicious motive for what could be complex editorial standards.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's own commentary is direct and clear about its viewpoint and accusations, not intentionally vague.

Appeal to authority – No – The author's argument is not based on an appeal to authority; in fact, it is structured to undermine the authority of the mainstream media.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy regarding media coverage. Example: "If these two men had survived, and Quentin Lamar Smith had died, you'd be hearing a lot about the race issue." This presents only two extreme outcomes of media behaviour, ignoring any nuanced possibilities.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author uses categorical phrases that discourage critical thought about the specifics of the case. Example: Placing the event in the ""Black Murders Of White Cops" category" serves to end discussion and apply a pre-formed judgment.

Red herring – Yes – The author introduces the "race issue" and media bias as the main topic, distracting from the facts of the crime (such as the domestic violence history) presented in the embedded news report. Example: The entire focus on the "Not Reporting Race" category shifts the debate from the crime itself to a critique of media coverage.

Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an argument that the media has not made. By creating a "Not Reporting Race" category, the author characterizes the media's silence on race as a deliberate, biased position, which they then attack. Example: "If these two men had survived, and Quentin Lamar Smith had died, you'd be hearing a lot about the race issue."

Whataboutism – Yes – The author accuses the media of hypocrisy by posing a hypothetical, reversed scenario. Example: "If these two men had survived, and Quentin Lamar Smith had died, you'd be hearing a lot about the race issue." This deflects from the current event to speculate about what would happen in a different one.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, racially-charged worldview and a distrust of mainstream media. The author achieves this by wrapping their own biased commentary around a factual news report, a technique used to lend credibility to their interpretation. The piece heavily employs numerous propaganda techniques, including loaded language to introduce racial stereotypes, the creation of thought-terminating slogans/categories ("Black Murders Of White Cops") to oversimplify a complex event, and the use of straw man, black & white fallacy, and whataboutism to attack a perceived media bias. The entire narrative is framed to provoke an emotional response (anger, resentment) and reinforce a pre-existing agenda rather than to encourage a nuanced understanding of the event.
