Based on the definitions provided and the text "Et Tu, Benedict?", here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling – Yes** – Examples: "lunatic" (referring to Pope Francis), "celebrity heretic" (Walter Kasper), "wolves in shepherds’ clothing", "Sankt Gallen Mafia", "frauds" (bishops), "maudlin drivel" (Benedict's letter). These are insulting labels attacking subjects.  
2. **Repetition – Yes** – The text repeatedly questions Benedict's resignation ("why would a pope... suddenly just decide to quit?"), his inaction ("why hear nothing from him?"), and associations with figures like Kasper ("Why is this man still a cardinal?").  
3. **Slogans – No** – No brief, memorable phrases are used to encapsulate the message; the text relies on extended arguments.  
4. **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Warns of dire consequences (e.g., Francis "drives the sheep off a cliff", "purge of faithful Catholics", "worst papacy of all time"), framing Benedict's resignation as enabling disaster.  
5. **Doubt – Yes** – Repeatedly questions Benedict's credibility: "Could we have been wrong about him?", "Why is this man still a cardinal?", speculation he was "under external compulsion", and "Who is the real Joseph Ratzinger?"  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggerates: "turned the Vatican into a den of thieves", "monstrous frauds in human history". Minimizes: Reduces Benedict's resignation reasons to trivialities like "I was a bit tired" or no black cassock fitting.  
7. **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Appeals to Catholic identity/orthodoxy (e.g., lamenting "heresy and blasphemy", praising "ancient Faith", condemning "New Paradigm" as non-Catholic).  
8. **Loaded Language – Yes** – Emotionally charged terms: "commedia diabolica", "poisons", "wolves", "lunatic", "drivel", "scandalous", "schizophrenic mindset".  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparisons to universally hated groups (e.g., Nazis) to discredit ideas.  
10. **Bandwagon – No** – Does not appeal to popularity; instead, positions Benedict/Francis as outliers betraying true Catholicism.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Blames Benedict’s resignation and tenure for complex Church issues: "he made way for the worst papacy", "destroyed by Joseph Ratzinger" (oversimplifying Vatican II outcomes to one speech).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – Arguments are direct, not obscured; terms like "New Paradigm" are defined contextually.  
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Cites Cardinal de Lubac ("destroyed by Ratzinger"), Maike Hickson, Steve Skojec, and Ross Douthat to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents Catholicism as binary: e.g., "New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same", dismissing "big umbrella" coexistence; frames Ratzinger as either "champion of orthodoxy" or secret progressive.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – Uses rhetorical questions and historical analysis to provoke critical thought, not end it.  
16. **Red herring – No** – Focuses tightly on Benedict’s actions/associations; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men – No** – Criticizes actual statements/actions (e.g., resignation reasons, Kasper's role); no refutation of unvoiced arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism – No** – Does not deflect criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy; focuses on Benedict’s choices.  

---

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic, employing at least 11 of the 18 techniques. It is a polemical critique of Benedict XVI, using loaded language, name-calling, and fear appeals to portray his resignation as a catastrophic betrayal that enabled Pope Francis's "disastrous" papacy. It oversimplifies complex theological and historical issues (e.g., Vatican II, Church governance) to blame Benedict and "liberal" figures like Kasper, while dismissing contrary evidence (e.g., Benedict’s own statements). The tone is emotionally manipulative, questioning Benedict’s motives and orthodoxy to sway traditionalist Catholics. However, it is not 100% propaganda due to its use of cited sources (e.g., de Lubac) and specific historical references, which provide a factual veneer. Yet, these are selectively deployed to support a biased narrative, aligning with propaganda’s goal of persuasion over balanced discourse.
