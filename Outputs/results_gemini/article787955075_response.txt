1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Peter Strzok and Lisa Page as “disgraced FBI figures.”
2. Repetition – No – While the topic of declassification is mentioned several times, it is the subject of the article and not a repeated message in a propagandistic sense.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear in the audience to support an idea.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text includes a quote from Carter Page questioning the legitimacy of the investigation, calling it a “mockery” and referring to “wrongdoing that was done by various officials within the Department of Justice, the FBI and the DNC.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The statement “it is safe to say that Democrats are probably panicking right about now” is an unsubstantiated exaggeration of the Democratic party’s reaction.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Carter Page’s quote appeals to patriotism by expressing concern for the “damage that this did to the U.S. government [and] the mockery it made out of the Constitution.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words such as “disgraced,” “mockery,” “wrongdoing,” and “panicking” to influence the reader’s perception.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to groups hated by the audience, such as Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text states the declassification was ordered “[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress,” suggesting that the idea is popular or has significant support.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text reports on an event (the order to declassify) rather than explaining the cause of a complex event with a simple reason.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is generally specific about the documents to be declassified and the people involved. The use of an unnamed source is a common journalistic practice, not necessarily an attempt to confuse.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly cites Fox News as a source of information, appealing to an authority trusted by a specific audience. It also uses quotes from figures like Carter Page and Sarah Sanders to lend credibility to its narrative.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The narrative implicitly frames the issue as a choice between supporting Trump’s “transparency” and siding with the “disgraced” FBI figures and “panicking” Democrats, ignoring other possibilities or nuances.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “it is safe to say” is used to present a speculative opinion as a foregone conclusion, discouraging the reader from questioning the assertion.
16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on the topic of the declassification of documents and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract.
17. Straw men – No – The article does not misrepresent or refute an opponent's argument; it primarily presents a one-sided narrative.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – By focusing on the alleged “wrongdoing” of the investigators (DOJ, FBI, DNC) through Carter Page's quote, the text deflects from the original subject of the investigation (potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia).

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it is centered on a factual event (President Trump ordering the declassification of documents), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint. This is achieved through the heavy use of multiple propaganda techniques. The article employs loaded language ("disgraced," "panicking") and name-calling to create a negative emotional response towards the subjects of the investigation. It frames the situation as a black and white conflict between Trump's "transparency" and corrupt officials. The author inserts a clear, unsubstantiated opinion with the exaggeration that "Democrats are probably panicking," presented as fact using a thought-terminating cliché ("it is safe to say"). The selective use of sources, leaning heavily on Fox News and a quote from Carter Page that casts doubt on the investigation and appeals to patriotism, further skews the narrative. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's perception of the event rather than report on it objectively.
