**Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, flag-waving, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to paint a stark contrast between Archbishop Viganò as a heroic figure and Pope Francis as a dangerous leader, aiming to sway the audience's perception and emotions. The presence of these techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is propaganda.**
