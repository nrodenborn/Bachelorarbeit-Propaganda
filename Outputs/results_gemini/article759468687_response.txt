1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the term "Infidels" to label non-Muslims, which is an insulting label in this context. It also quotes a description of "Jewish tourists" as "plunderers of holy lands."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times consecutively. The core message that Ramadan is a "month of jihad" is also repeated throughout the text.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase "Ramadan is the month of jihad" is used repeatedly to create a brief and memorable message summarizing the article's main point.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that pretending Ramadan is not the month of jihad is "dangerous, suicidal folly" and that as a result, "more Infidels will die," instilling fear in the audience against holding a different view.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of President Trump's statement on Ramadan, calling it "severely misleading the American people."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by stating that Ramadan is "quintessentially the month of jihad" and that murdering non-believers "embodies" the spirit of Ramadan, while minimizing or ignoring peaceful interpretations and observances.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to an in-group identity by repeatedly using the term "Infidels" and framing the issue as a danger to "the American people," who are being "severely mislead[ing]."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases such as "murdered," "suicidal folly," and "willful blindness" to appeal to the reader's emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an idea by associating it with Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its ideas are correct because they are popular; rather, it presents its view as a contrarian truth against a mainstream narrative.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex phenomenon of terrorism during Ramadan to a single cause: "Islam’s core beliefs," as exemplified by the statement, "Murdering infidels thus doesn’t contradict the spirit of Ramadan; it embodies it."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text's message is direct and unambiguous, not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the Qur’an ("Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah...") and a "jihad group" as authorities to support its argument about the nature of Ramadan.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two choices: either Ramadan is about "richness" or it is "a month of calamity everywhere for nonbelievers," ignoring any other possibilities or interpretations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The statement "it would be dangerous, suicidal folly for Infidels to pretend that Ramadan is not the month of jihad" is used to shut down any alternative viewpoint by framing it as irrational and life-threatening.
16. Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of a poll asking "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is completely irrelevant to the article's topic and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument not made by Shadi Hamid. Hamid is quoted as saying Muslims shouldn't be "defined solely" by terrorism, which the author reframes as an attempt to "absolve the Muslim community of any responsibility to root out jihad terrorist from its midst."
18. Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes its opponents directly but does not use the technique of deflecting criticism by accusing them of hypocrisy on another issue.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and overt piece of propaganda. It employs an overwhelming majority (15 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques to advance a specific, emotionally charged agenda. The primary goal is to persuade the reader that Islam is inherently violent and that Ramadan is fundamentally a month of war against non-Muslims.

This is achieved through several coordinated tactics:
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** It uses Name-calling ("Infidels"), Loaded Language ("murdered," "suicidal folly"), and a powerful Appeal to Fear to create an "us vs. them" narrative and provoke an emotional response rather than a rational one.
*   **Logical Fallacies:** It constructs a deliberately misleading argument using a Black & White Fallacy (presenting only two extreme views of Ramadan), Causal Oversimplification (blaming all violence on "Islam's core beliefs"), and a Straw Man argument (misrepresenting an opponent's position to easily attack it).
*   **Argumentative Reinforcement:** The central message is hammered home through Repetition and the use of a Slogan ("Ramadan is the month of jihad"). It selectively uses Appeal to Authority by citing only extremist sources as evidence for the "true" meaning of Islam, while using Doubt to discredit mainstream views.
*   **Distraction:** The inclusion of a completely irrelevant Red Herring (the poll about Democrat politicians) demonstrates that the article's purpose is not journalistic or informative, but rather to push a political agenda and distract from substantive discussion.

The combination of these techniques shows a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's perception, shut down critical thought, and promote a singular, fear-based worldview. The text is not an attempt at honest discourse but a textbook example of propaganda.
