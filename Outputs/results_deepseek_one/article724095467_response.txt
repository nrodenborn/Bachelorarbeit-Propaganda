Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the given text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – While the text accuses the LVMPD and FBI of "gross negligence" and a "cover-up," these are accusations based on the alleged event, not insulting labels *attached* to the subject itself without basis in the definition's sense.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message (a missing victim and cover-up) is consistent, but it is not mechanically repeated in a short span; it's developed through narrative.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable catchphrase is used to encapsulate the message (e.g., no equivalent to "Build the Wall").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text instills fear of government incompetence and intentional cover-ups ("gross negligence or a massive cover-up," "completely botched investigation and cover-up," "How many more victims went ignored?"), suggesting authorities cannot be trusted.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The text repeatedly questions the credibility of the official investigation and report ("failed to catalogue," "cover-up," "botched investigation," "How was this victim overlooked?", "Will the F.B.I. and LVMPD please explain what in the Hell is going on here?", "How many more victims went ignored?").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – The language used is highly exaggerated and inflammatory ("gross negligence," "massive cover-up," "completely botched investigation," "astonishingly"). It minimizes the likelihood of an innocent explanation for the discrepancy.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity to support the argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – The text uses highly emotional and negatively charged language throughout: "gross negligence," "massive cover-up," "completely botched," "lifeless body," "drug across," "astonishingly," "what in the Hell".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons are made to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally despised groups to discredit the authorities.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not argue that the cover-up claim should be believed because it is popular or many others believe it.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – The text strongly implies the debris movement *must* be from a helicopter hovering close by (suggesting involvement/cover-up), dismissing simpler explanations (like wind, passing helicopters, or camera artifacts) and presenting the helicopter observation as near-proof of something sinister related to the victim count.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is very specific with details (times, locations, sources, report page numbers). It aims for clarity, not obscurity.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text cites Tucker Carlson and Shepard Ambellas (Intellihub) as sources for its claims about the footage and the victim, using their reporting as evidence ("According to Carlson," "reported by Intellihub’s Shepard Ambellas," "Carlson claims").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – The text presents the discrepancy in the victim count as evidence of only two possible options: "gross negligence or a massive cover-up." It doesn't consider less sinister explanations (e.g., genuine error, miscommunication, different classification criteria).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used to shut down critical thinking (e.g., "it's obvious," "just common sense," "end of story").
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The detail about Sean Hannity (presumably) getting a haircut in the parking lot the next day is entirely irrelevant to the core claim about the uncatalogued victim or the helicopter debris. It serves only to add a layer of bizarre suspicion and distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument not made by the authorities. It disputes the official report based on its own evidence.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse the LVMPD/FBI of hypocrisy by pointing to their own past actions on unrelated matters.

**Verdict – 90% – The text exhibits strong characteristics of propaganda.** It employs multiple persuasive techniques (Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Red Herring) to advance a narrative of a government cover-up concerning the Las Vegas shooting victim count. The core claims are presented as established fact ("failed to catalogue," "cover-up," "59th victim") based on selective evidence (uncorroborated footage, a discrepancy in a report) and sources with clear agendas (Intellihub, Tucker Carlson). The language is highly inflammatory and emotionally charged, designed to provoke outrage and distrust. The inclusion of irrelevant, suspicious details (helicopters, Hannity haircut) further fuels conspiracy thinking without providing substantive proof for the central claim of a deliberate cover-up. While it raises a factual question about the victim count, the overwhelming use of manipulative techniques pushes it firmly into the realm of propaganda aimed at discrediting authorities and promoting a specific, sinister interpretation.
