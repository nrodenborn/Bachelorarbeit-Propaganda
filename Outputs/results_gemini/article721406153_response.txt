1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents with insulting terms such as “imaginary Catholic Pharisees,” “neo-Pharisaical,” “endlessly double-talking Cardinal Müller,” “knowing dupes,” and a “wayward Roman Pontiff.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the rhetorical question “Do they think we are fools?” and its variations (“Does Cardinal Müller think we are fools?”, “Evidently, they do think we are fools”) to reinforce its central theme of being deceived.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not employ brief, memorable phrases intended for mass repetition. It is structured as a long-form argument, and while it has a recurring theme, it does not create or use slogans.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by describing the situation as a “moral subversion,” an “unparalleled debacle for the Church,” and a “ferocious attack from the very vertices of the Church,” suggesting the Church’s fundamental nature is under threat.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built around casting doubt on the credibility of Pope Francis and his collaborators. For example, it states, “The Cardinal knows this is moral and canonical nonsense,” directly questioning Cardinal Müller’s integrity and knowledge.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses extreme exaggeration, describing a theological opinion as a “lie from the pit of hell” and the current situation as an “unparalleled debacle.” It also minimizes the opposing viewpoint by calling it “outrageous opinion” and “verbal contortions.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific religious identity rather than national patriotism. It rallies its audience by invoking a shared duty to “defend the Church’s teaching,” uphold the “bimillenial prohibition,” and remain faithful to “the entire Tradition of the Catholic and Apostolic faith.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is saturated with emotionally charged words intended to influence the reader, such as “tirade,” “subversion,” “conspiracy,” “preposterous,” “sacked,” and “ferocious attack.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or person to Hitler or the Nazi party. While it uses the term “Pharisees” as a hated group, it does not use the specific *ad Hitlerum* technique.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does the opposite of a bandwagon appeal. It presents its own side as a principled minority (“But we are not fools”) standing against a powerful and corrupt trend within the Church, appealing to a sense of righteous resistance rather than popularity.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex pastoral and theological developments in the Church to a single, simple cause: a “conspiracy culminating in Amoris Laetitia” and the deliberate “moral subversion” by the Pope, ignoring other potential factors.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s writing is direct, aggressive, and clear in its accusations. It accuses its opponents of using vague language (“ill-defined ‘process of discernment’”) but does not employ the technique itself.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on the authority of Cardinal Burke to refute Cardinal Müller. It quotes him at length and highlights his former position as “head of the Church’s highest tribunal” to present his opinion as definitive evidence.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice between absolute fidelity to tradition (“keep the Faith”) and complicity in “moral subversion.” There is no room for nuance or a middle ground; one is either with the author’s side or a “knowing dupe.”

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like “God will not be mocked” to end the argument with an appeal to divine authority, discouraging further critical thought. The phrase “ours is but to keep the Faith” also serves to shut down complex discussion in favor of simple adherence.

16. Red herring – Yes – The parenthetical aside about “Catholic Answers” and the “pro-homosexual bishop Francis has installed in San Diego” is a red herring. It introduces a separate issue (homosexuality) and a different organization to distract from the main argument and broaden the scope of the attack.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a distorted version of the Pope’s argument. It claims Francis is on a “tirade against the imaginary Catholic Pharisees who defend the Church’s teaching,” reframing a likely complex pastoral argument about mercy into a simple and malicious attack on doctrinal fidelity, which is easier to condemn.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy on an unrelated issue. Its accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., being “neo-Pharisaical”) are direct attacks within the main line of argument, not a deflection tactic.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is an extremely strong example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to engage in a reasoned theological debate but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly critical viewpoint by employing a dense concentration of propaganda techniques. The author systematically uses emotional manipulation (Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear, Exaggeration), logical fallacies (Black & White Fallacy, Causal Oversimplification, Straw Man), and attacks on the character and credibility of opponents (Name-calling, Doubt). It creates a powerful in-group/out-group dynamic by appealing to a specific Catholic identity (Flag-Waving) and positioning this group as a righteous minority resisting a corrupt leadership. The use of a respected authority (Cardinal Burke) to validate its claims and thought-terminating clichés to shut down dissent further solidifies its propagandistic nature. The sheer volume and combination of these techniques, woven into every paragraph, indicate a deliberate effort to mobilize an audience through rhetoric rather than objective analysis.
