Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique within the Patrick J. Buchanan text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – Explanation: Attacks opponents with insulting labels: "summertime soldier" (Corker), "Beltway elites," "Bush-McCain Republican establishment," implying they are out of touch and cowardly.
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – Explanation: Repeats key phrases to reinforce the message: "GOP establishment" (multiple times), "open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism, compulsive military intervention" (listed twice), "uncivil war" (twice).
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – Explanation: Uses brief, memorable phrases associated with the promoted viewpoint: "Make China great again" (parodying Trump), "You can't go home again" (used to dismiss the establishment's hopes).
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Explanation: Warns of dire consequences if Trump's opposition prevails: "there will be a truly uncivil war in this country."
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – Explanation: Repeatedly questions the competence and awareness of the GOP establishment: "How could the Beltway GOP not see...", "Could Republicans not see the factories shutting down...", "what is the case now for America... going abroad in search of monsters to destroy?"
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Explanation: Exaggerates the negative outcomes of establishment policies: "$12 trillion in trade deficits... a loss of 55,000 plants and 6 million manufacturing jobs." Minimizes the complexity of issues by blaming them solely on these policies.
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to American identity and patriotism: References to "the American dream," "our strategic position and presence in Asia," "this country," "that most American of writers, Thomas Wolfe."
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged or value-laden terms: "coarsened," "savagery," "uncivil war," "blunders," "alienating," "awash in blood," "uprooted and homeless," "nativists," "moral superiority," "be rid of the regime resting on top of all of us."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or collaborators like Vichy are made in this text.
10. **Bandwagon – Yes** – Explanation: Emphasizes Trump's success and the adoption of his ideas: "Trump is president because he read the party and the country right," "the president's brand of hard-edged nationalism... is taking root within his adopted party," references to the voters of Sanders, Cruz, and Trump sharing a common desire.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Explanation: Attributes complex outcomes (trade deficits, manufacturing job loss, Middle East instability) solely to specific GOP establishment policies (open borders, free trade, military interventionism), ignoring other contributing factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – Explanation: The text is relatively direct in its criticisms and arguments. Phrases like "the regime resting on top of all of us" are metaphorical but not deliberately obscure or confusing in context.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Explanation: Cites the *New York Times* to validate Trump's triumph: "Yesterday's New York Times recognized Trump's triumph..." Also uses Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan as figures of conservative authority.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Explanation: Presents the conflict as only two options: Trumpism/nationalism vs. the failed GOP establishment/globalism. Assimilating immigrants is presented as the only alternative to "open borders" and "amnesty."
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Explanation: Uses phrases that shut down debate about returning to pre-Trump policies: "Trumpism is not a detour," "there is no going back," "You can't go home again."
16. **Red herring – No** – Explanation: While criticizing opponents, the arguments generally stay focused on policy differences and consequences rather than introducing completely irrelevant material to distract.
17. **Straw men – Weak/No** – Explanation: Criticizes the actual policies of the GOP establishment (open borders, free trade, interventionism) rather than misrepresenting them. The characterization of their response to opposition ("call them nativists and parade their moral superiority") is a common criticism but not a clear refutation of an unstated argument.
18. **Whataboutism – Yes** – Explanation: Counters criticism of Trump (coarsening politics, being "dangerous") by pointing to the perceived failures and hypocrisy of his critics (Flake, Corker, Bush, McCain): "Yet no two people are more responsible for the blunders of the post-Cold War era than McCain and Bush. About which of half a dozen wars were they right?"

**Verdict – 70% – Explanation:** The text exhibits a high concentration of identifiable propaganda techniques (10-12 clear instances out of 18). Its primary purpose is persuasive, aiming to discredit the "GOP establishment" (Flake, Corker, Bush, McCain) and legitimize Trump's takeover of the Republican Party and his policies (nationalism, immigration restriction, trade protectionism, non-interventionism). It achieves this through heavy use of **Loaded Language**, **Name Calling**, **Appeal to Fear**, **Doubt**, **Bandwagon**, **Causal Oversimplification**, **Black & White Fallacy**, and **Thought-terminating Clichés**, while also employing **Repetition**, **Slogans**, **Exaggeration**, **Flag-Waving**, **Appeal to Authority**, and **Whataboutism**. While it presents arguments based on policy outcomes (trade deficits, war results), these are framed selectively and simplistically to serve the persuasive goal. The tone is polemical and dismissive of opposing viewpoints. The self-promotional book plugs at the end further signal its advocacy purpose. It is not purely informational; it is designed to promote a specific political narrative and viewpoint using recognized persuasive (propaganda) techniques. The 30% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of some factual claims and policy arguments within the highly persuasive framework.
