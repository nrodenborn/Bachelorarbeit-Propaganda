### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to multiple coordinated techniques:  
- **Purpose**: To discredit Kavanaugh’s accuser and her lawyer by associating them with George Soros (a polarizing figure) and Democratic partisanship, rather than engaging with the assault allegation.  
- **Techniques deployed**: Name-calling, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, black-and-white framing, thought-terminating clichés, and red herring. These collectively manipulate perception by implying the accusation is a fabricated "smear" by a biased "left."  
- **Indicators of Propaganda**:  
  - **Selective framing**: Focuses on funding (Soros) and donations to Democrats to imply dishonesty, while dismissing POGO’s non-partisan self-description as an afterthought ("UPDATE").  
  - **Emotional manipulation**: Sarcasm ("What a surprise!") and sinister imagery ("tentacles") evoke distrust.  
  - **Suppression of scrutiny**: Dismissive language discourages evaluating the assault claim on its merits.  
The 5% uncertainty stems from the inclusion of POGO’s rebuttal, though it is undermined by the overall tone. The text aligns with agenda-driven misinformation, not neutral reporting.
