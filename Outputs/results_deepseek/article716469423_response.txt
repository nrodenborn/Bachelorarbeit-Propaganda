Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to specific opponents or ideas.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The concepts of the sun "dimming," "going dark," having "no sunspots," and the potential for an "ice age" are repeated throughout the text. ("The Sun Is Going DARK," "dimming," "no sunspots," "ice age Approaches," "dimming," "sun gets successively more blank," "decline in total solar irradiance," "dimming of our sun," "mini ice age," "Solar activity... has been declining," "plunging global temperatures," "freezing temperatures").
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – "The Sun Is Going DARK: No Sunspots For 96 Days; Ice Age Approaches" functions as a brief, memorable, and alarming headline/slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text repeatedly invokes fear of catastrophic consequences: "Ice Age Approaches," "mini ice age," "barrage of cataclysmic events," "huge seismic events, including volcanic eruptions," "plunging global temperatures," "destabilization of the Earth’s crust," "extreme weather and freezing temperatures." It positions the sun's dimming as the cause of these feared outcomes.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The text casts doubt on the credibility of environmental campaigners' views on global warming: "This warning will infuriate environmental campaigners who argue by 2030 the world faces increased sea levels and flooding due to glacial melt at the poles and a warming of the globe." It implies their view is wrong or will be proven wrong.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – **Exaggeration** is prominent: Using "DARK" in the headline, describing potential effects as a "barrage of cataclysmic events," linking sunspot decline directly to a specific 15-year "mini ice age" and major seismic events. The severity and certainty of the predicted consequences are amplified beyond what the cited sources (like Joe Joseph saying "I don't know") actually support.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or national/group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged and dramatic language is used throughout: "Going DARK," "Ice Age Approaches," "plunges," "cataclysmic events," "hibernation," "destabilization," "infuriate," "barrage." Terms like "The Daily Sheeple" also carry a subtle negative connotation (implying followers).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt is made to link ideas to universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Appeals to the idea that "other sources" and "a team of experts" support the view of an imminent mini ice age and catastrophic events: "But other sources say it’s more than possible," "A team of experts have warned," "Scientists say".
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text strongly implies that the *sole* or *primary* cause of a potential "mini ice age" and "cataclysmic events" (seismic activity, volcanic eruptions, plunging temps) is the current decline in sunspots/solar activity ("due to the dimming of our sun"). It oversimplifies complex climate and geological systems.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Partial – While some sources are named (NASA, Spaceweather, Watts Up With That?, The Express UK, The Space and Science Research Center), key claims lack specific attribution or context. Phrases like "other sources," "a team of experts," "Research... revealed a strong link" are vague. Joseph's quote ("in a very generalistic sense... as vanilla as you can possibly make it") acknowledges oversimplification but doesn't clarify the actual complexity.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Relies heavily on citing NASA data, NASA satellites, NASA SDO, Spaceweather, TSIS-1 mission, The Space and Science Research Center, and unnamed "experts" and "scientists" to lend credibility to the claims about solar dimming and its potential effects.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Implicitly frames the future climate scenario as an either/or: *Either* the environmentalists are right about warming/flooding *or* this group is right about cooling/ice age/seismic catastrophe. It presents these as the primary conflicting possibilities, ignoring nuance or other factors.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No obvious simplistic phrases are used to shut down discussion. The text is more about raising alarm than terminating thought.
16. **Red herring** – Partial – The final paragraph introducing the reaction of "environmental campaigners" diverts attention slightly from the main sun/ice age argument to contrast it with the opposing global warming view, potentially to discredit that opposing view based on the sun argument. However, it's still somewhat related to the core climate debate.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text doesn't misrepresent the environmentalist position; it accurately states their concern about warming, sea levels, and flooding by 2030. It just contrasts it with its own opposing prediction.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – There are no charges of hypocrisy leveled against opponents (environmental campaigners); the text only contrasts their predicted outcomes with its own.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its primary goal is not balanced scientific reporting but to persuade the reader of an alarming and specific narrative (imminent mini ice age/catastrophe caused by solar dimming) while casting doubt on opposing views (anthropogenic global warming). Key indicators include:
*   **Sensationalism & Fear Mongering:** The dramatic headline, loaded language ("DARK," "cataclysmic," "destabilization"), and relentless focus on extreme, fear-inducing consequences.
*   **Exaggeration & Oversimplification:** Amplifying the certainty and severity of the predicted outcomes far beyond the cautious "I don't know" of one source and oversimplifying complex climate science into a direct sunspot=ice age/catastrophe link.
*   **Appeals to Authority & Bandwagon:** Selective use of NASA data and unnamed "experts/scientists/other sources" to bolster the central claim, creating an impression of consensus where nuance exists.
*   **Repetition & Slogans:** Reinforcing the core alarming messages ("dimming," "no sunspots," "ice age") and using a memorable, fear-based headline.
*   **Creating Dichotomy (Black & White):** Framing the future as a binary conflict between the text's cooling catastrophe and environmentalists' warming flood, ignoring complex interactions.
*   **Doubt Casting:** Explicitly mentioning the predicted reaction of environmental campaigners to "infuriate" them, positioning their science as incorrect in the face of this solar evidence.

While it uses some factual elements (NASA data on sunspots, the existence of the TSIS-1 mission, the 11-year solar cycle), these are embedded within and used to support a highly persuasive, alarmist, and selectively presented argument characteristic of propaganda. The overwhelming use of fear, exaggeration, simplification, and selective sourcing strongly indicates a propagandistic intent.
