1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses the full name “Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah” which is a common name-calling tactic used to imply he is foreign or ‘other’. It also refers to Hillary Clinton as a “known criminal”.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is repeated three times in a row. The core message comparing Saucier’s treatment to Hillary Clinton’s is also repeated throughout the text by multiple speakers.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase “two-tier justice system” is used as a brief, memorable phrase to encapsulate the article's central argument.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text claims Hillary Clinton’s email server resulted in “a national security breach and at least one death,” which is intended to instill fear about the consequences of her actions.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is framed to cast doubt on the credibility and fairness of the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI, exemplified by the line: “The same FBI that gave Hillary Clinton a pass… but would not give the same leniency to Saucier.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes Saucier’s actions as he “simply took some pictures of his submarine,” while exaggerating the certainty of Clinton’s guilt and the scale of her foundation, calling it a “corrupt foundation taking in billions.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by mentioning “trashing our Republic” and framing the issue as something “a lot of Americans continue to ask,” aligning its position with the will of the American people.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “illegal email server,” “corrupt foundation,” “known criminal,” and “trashing our Republic” to evoke strong emotional responses from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The author claims to “continue to ask what a lot of Americans continue to ask,” suggesting that this viewpoint is popular and the reader should agree with it.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple reason for Saucier’s prosecution, with Saucier claiming, “They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton,” ignoring the other complex legal factors of his own case.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text makes the serious claim of “at least one death” resulting from Clinton’s emails but provides no specifics, evidence, or source, leaving the accusation vague to maximize emotional impact without being easily refutable.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses President Trump’s support for Saucier as evidence of his case’s merit: “President Trump had spoken of his support of Saucier on the campaign trail and blasted the Obama administration's handling of his case.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The article presents the situation as a “two-tier justice system,” a false dichotomy that suggests there are only two ways justice is applied (one for the elite, one for everyone else), ignoring the nuances and specific legal differences between the Saucier and Clinton cases.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The rhetorical question, “But hey, Hillary is free, right?” is used not to invite thought but to shut down any nuanced discussion with a cynical, pre-ordained conclusion.
16. Red herring – Yes – While Saucier’s lawsuit is the topic, the text repeatedly introduces the largely separate issue of Hillary Clinton’s emails and foundation to distract the reader from the specific facts of Saucier’s case (such as his confession and destruction of evidence) and redirect their anger.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the unstated argument that the justice system is perfectly fair and equal by setting up the Saucier/Clinton comparison. It attacks this simplified, implicit position rather than engaging with the actual, complex legal arguments for why the two cases were treated differently by prosecutors.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – This is the central technique of the text. Nearly every point about Saucier’s conviction is immediately deflected with a question or statement about Hillary Clinton. For example: “They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal... but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton.”

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint by employing a vast and overwhelming number of propaganda techniques. The article abandons journalistic objectivity from the outset, framing the story not as a legal proceeding but as a political battle. The use of Whataboutism is the central pillar of the entire piece, consistently deflecting from the facts of Saucier's case to attack a political opponent. This is supported by a barrage of other techniques including loaded language ("corrupt," "illegal"), name-calling, appeals to fear (unsubstantiated claims of a death), and a black & white fallacy (the "two-tier justice system"). The inclusion of a repetitive, leading poll and the author's final editorializing monologue, which calls for political action, removes all doubt that the piece is an instrument of persuasion rather than objective reporting.
