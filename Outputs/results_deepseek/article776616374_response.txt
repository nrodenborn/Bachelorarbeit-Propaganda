Below is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text, followed by a verdict on whether the text constitutes propaganda. Examples are drawn directly from the text where applicable.

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "de facto government employee" (to describe mainstream media), "flagrant lies" (to describe government/media claims).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans (e.g., "Fake News" is descriptive, not a crafted slogan).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "retired military officials... are even warning about more staged events to pull us into war" implies imminent danger from government deception.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "if you are to believe the official story" (questions legitimacy), "widely discredited official story," and "But it wasn’t true. At all."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "deluge of information," "most flagrant lies ever dreamed up." Minimization: "renewed attacks" (quoted but framed as false).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity; instead, it criticizes U.S. actions.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "slaughtered," "fictitious creation," "tarnishing the reputation," "sabotaged by fake news" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis or hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on popularity to sway opinion.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames media compliance as the sole reason for prolonged war: "If due diligence had been performed... over a million lives would’ve been saved."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct and specific (e.g., citing documents and interviews).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites Robert McNamara, Võ Nguyên Giáp, and Tom Wells to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Portrays media as uncritically repeating government lies vs. hypothetical truth-telling: "mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity... couldn’t be disputed."  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "end of discussion" that halt debate; encourages critical thought.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The Brett Kavanaugh poll distracts from the Gulf of Tonkin narrative and serves as an engagement tactic.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Accusations against government/media align with actual claims in the text (e.g., "unprovoked attack—this was a lie").  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting critics.

### Verdict – 85% – 
The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements, primarily through **loaded language**, **appeal to fear**, **doubt**, and **causal oversimplification** to advance a specific narrative. It selectively presents facts (e.g., McNamara’s admission) while omitting counter-evidence, frames the media as government pawns, and uses emotionally charged terms ("slaughtered," "sabotaged") to evoke outrage. The **repetition** of the Kavanaugh poll and **red herring** diversion further align with persuasion tactics. However, it avoids techniques like *flag-waving* or *thought-terminating clichés* and includes verifiable historical context (e.g., declassified documents), reducing its score from 100%. The core intent—to discredit institutions and imply ongoing deception—renders it predominantly propaganda, though not purely fictional.
