Name calling – Yes – The text attacks Michael Hayden by calling his analogy "particularly stupid" and his tweet "thoughtless."

Repetition – No – The text does not repeat the same message or phrase multiple times in the style of a chant or slogan.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to rally support.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that the motivation behind the comparisons is to "end national security forever," instilling fear about the consequences of the opposing viewpoint.

Doubt – Yes – The text questions Michael Hayden's credibility by stating, "You might think that would have cured him of facile Nazi analogies. But instead it seems to have whetted his appetite for making them."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the motivations of the opposition by claiming their goal is to "end national security forever." It also minimizes the act of family separation by stating, "Just about every country splits up families when they arrest the parents."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity, although it mentions "national security."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "human shields," "shameless Zionists," and "particularly stupid" to influence the audience's perception.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text is explicitly arguing against the use of Nazi/Holocaust comparisons by others; it is not using this technique itself to discredit an idea.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its position is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex motivations behind the criticism of immigration policy, stating that "The attacks here are motivated by a desire for open borders."

Appeal to authority – No – The text mentions an authority figure, Michael Hayden, but only to criticize him, not to use his authority as evidence for its own claims.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to discourage critical thought.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the Muslim Brotherhood's leaders praising Hitler to distract from the central argument about US immigration policy and frame the debate around a perceived media double standard, rather than the merits of the analogy itself.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that was not presented by claiming that those who criticize the immigration policy want to "delegitimize any and all law enforcement" and "end national security forever."

Whataboutism – Yes – The text attacks Michael Hayden by charging him with hypocrisy: "It's particularly stupid of Michael Hayden to make that analogy because during the Bush years, the agencies he ran were compared to Nazi Germany."

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. It employs a very high number of propaganda techniques not as incidental rhetorical flourishes, but as the fundamental structure of its argument. The piece is not designed to foster a reasoned debate about the sensitive topic of Holocaust analogies. Instead, its primary purpose is to persuade the reader by discrediting the opposition and provoking an emotional response.

It heavily relies on logical fallacies like Straw Men (misrepresenting opponents' goals as wanting to "end national security forever"), Causal Oversimplification (stating the sole motive is "a desire for open borders"), and the Black & White Fallacy (the "2 very simple rules"). Furthermore, it focuses intensely on attacking the messenger rather than the message, using Whataboutism, Name Calling, and Doubt to undermine Michael Hayden personally. The use of Loaded Language ("human shields") and Appeal to Fear ("end national security forever") is designed to bypass rational analysis and trigger an emotional, alarmist reaction in the reader. The combination of these techniques creates a one-sided, highly manipulative text whose goal is ideological reinforcement, not objective discussion.
