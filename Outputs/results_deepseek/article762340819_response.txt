Based on the definitions provided and analysis of the text, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "worst President in American history", "black-hearted Presbyterian bigot" (referring to Wilson), "crook" (referring to Nixon), "sanctimony and incompetence" (referring to Carter), "Leftist Privilege".
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The core accusation of "treason" is repeated numerous times throughout the text (e.g., "Obama’s Treason", "tried for treason", "the definition of treason", "treason on a scale", "Obama’s aid and comfort").
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "Death to America" (quoted Iranian chant), "Leftist Privilege".
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "Iranian-backed terrorists", "jihad massacres of Americans", "destroy the United States", "nuclear weapons", "catastrophe", "bitter fruit for years, and probably decades".
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "skirted key U.S. sanctions" despite "public assurances", "secret efforts", implying deception and questioning the administration's honesty and motives.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – *Exaggeration:* "worst President in American history", "showered hundreds of billions of dollars", "treason on a scale to rival...", "gave the world Hitler and World War II" (re Wilson), "tremendous boost", "catastrophe". *Minimization:* Downplaying the faults of other presidents (e.g., Harding's "normalcy" got the economy "roaring", Grant was merely "blind to corruption").
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Appeals to patriotism and loyalty by framing actions as betraying the US to its enemies ("levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort", "Death to America", "destroy the United States") and contrasting with "restor[ing] sanctions" under Trump.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Pervasive use of emotionally charged and negative terms: "Treason", "skirted", "secret", "terrorists", "worst", "black-hearted", "bigot", "crook", "betrayed", "sanctimony", "incompetence", "jihad", "massacres", "catastrophe", "aid and comfort to the enemy", "Leftist Privilege", "Pah!".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – While Hitler is mentioned ("arguably gave the world Hitler"), it's used to attack Wilson, not to disapprove an idea by linking it to a hated group relevant to the main argument against Obama. The main argument relies on direct accusations of treason, not guilt-by-association with Hitler/Nazism.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – The text does not argue that Obama's actions should be condemned *because* many others believe it or it's popular. It argues based on alleged facts and moral/legal judgment.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Blames Wilson solely for giving "the world Hitler and World War II", ignoring the vast complexity of historical causation for those events.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The accusations are direct and specific (treason, giving money to terrorists, skirting sanctions), not obscured by vague language. Terms like "aid and comfort" are legal terms defined in the quoted code.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Cites "The Washington Free Beacon", "congressional investigation" by the "House Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations", "Bill Gertz in the Washington Times", and U.S. Code 2381 as evidence backing the treason accusation.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents Obama's actions as purely treasonous ("He is, without any doubt, the worst President... But there is one thing Barack Obama has on all competitors: treason") and frames the issue as a simple case of giving "aid and comfort to the enemy" without acknowledging potential counterarguments or complexities of international diplomacy and frozen assets.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Phrases like "Leftist Privilege", "Laws are for conservatives", and the repeated, definitive label "treason" shut down critical examination by providing simplistic, emotionally charged explanations.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – The extensive discussion and ranking of other "bad" Presidents (Fillmore, Pierce, Buchanan, Grant, Wilson, Harding, FDR, LBJ, Nixon, Carter) distracts from the specific allegations against Obama regarding Iran and sanctions, serving primarily to elevate Obama as uniquely "the worst" and a traitor.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Refutes the argument "It was their money" by focusing on the reason for freezing it (not belonging to the mullahs) and past presidents' refusal to release it. This simplifies and misrepresents the complex legal and diplomatic arguments *for* releasing the funds as part of negotiations, presenting it merely as an illegitimate claim of ownership by the mullahs that only Obama foolishly accepted.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – While other presidents are discussed, it's not to charge critics with hypocrisy ("What about Nixon/Carter/etc.?"). It's used comparatively to elevate Obama's alleged crime (treason) above their faults, not to deflect criticism of Obama.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a large number of defined propaganda techniques (13 out of 18 identified) very prominently, including Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language, Black & White Fallacy, and Thought-terminating clichés. The core argument relies on an inflammatory accusation of "treason," supported by selectively presented information, highly emotional and biased language, and logical fallacies. Its primary purpose is not a balanced analysis but to provoke strong negative emotions (anger, fear, outrage) towards Barack Obama, delegitimize him and his actions ("Leftist Privilege"), and promote a specific political narrative. While it references real events (congressional reports, the frozen assets, U.S. Code), these are framed and interpreted in an extremely one-sided, manipulative manner characteristic of propaganda. The lack of nuance, the relentless demonization, and the reliance on emotional manipulation rather than reasoned argument solidify this classification. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the existence of factual references within the highly propagandistic framework.
