Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including doubt, loaded language, obfuscation, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and thought-terminating clichés. These elements suggest a moderate likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it presents a biased perspective on the issue of blessing same-sex unions within the Catholic Church. The text aims to influence the reader’s perception by questioning the credibility of Cardinal Marx, using emotionally charged language, and appealing to authoritative figures to support its stance. However, it does not employ all possible propaganda techniques, and it includes multiple viewpoints, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood of it being pure propaganda.
