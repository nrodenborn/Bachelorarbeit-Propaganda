Here is the analysis of the propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Dina Powell is the swamp," "one of the worst swamp creatures in D.C."  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated use of "swamp" (e.g., "Dina Powell is the swamp," "appointing the swamp," "swamp creatures").  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "Drain the swamp" (used as a rallying cry against establishment figures).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warns Powell will "undo all the progress" Haley made, return the U.S. to the "failed politics" of the Human Rights Council and PLO support.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Powell's qualifications: "Unlike McFarland, Habib Powell had no national security background."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates Powell’s influence ("Barely 30, Habib Powell had more power than many of the big Bush era names") and minimizes her credentials by omission.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Praises Nikki Haley for defending U.S. interests ("UN members will be punished if they push the US around"), implying Powell would betray patriotism.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Swamp creatures," "angry left-wing Democrats," "failed politics," "effusive praise" (used pejoratively).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Implies Powell’s associations (e.g., Clinton, Obama allies) make her part of a corrupt "establishment" group.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames Powell’s potential appointment for complex outcomes (e.g., "the US would be right back in the Human Rights Council").  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Criticisms are specific (e.g., naming events, organizations, and people).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Uses Nikki Haley’s tenure as a positive benchmark to contrast Powell’s unsuitability.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents Powell (bad, "swamp") vs. Haley (good, strong), ignoring nuance.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Drain the swamp" shuts down debate by framing Powell as inherently corrupt.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Focuses on Powell’s associations (e.g., with Valerie Jarrett, Huma Abedin) to distract from her qualifications.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Critiques Powell’s actual associations and actions (e.g., speeches, events).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy; focuses solely on Powell.  

---

**Verdict – 95%** – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs multiple techniques (e.g., name-calling, fear appeals, loaded language) to vilify Dina Powell through guilt-by-association with figures like Clinton, Obama, and Huma Abedin. The core argument—that Powell "is the swamp"—relies on emotional manipulation rather than balanced analysis of her qualifications. Selective facts (e.g., her Goldman Sachs role, event attendance) are framed to imply nefarious intent, while ignoring potential counter-evidence. The language is consistently derogatory ("swamp creatures," "disaster"), and the structure aims to provoke outrage against a perceived establishment betrayal. Though it cites real events, their presentation is distorted to serve a singular, aggressive narrative opposing Powell’s appointment, leaving no room for objectivity.
