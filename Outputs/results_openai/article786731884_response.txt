**Verdict – 80% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and the black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to portray Facebook's actions in a negative light and to rally support for Jamie Glazov's viewpoint. The frequent use of emotionally charged language and the oversimplification of complex issues contribute to the likelihood that the text is propaganda.**
