Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and whataboutism. These techniques are used to persuade the audience to view Assange as a victim of government and media corruption, and to question the integrity of those institutions. While the text provides historical context and references to support its claims, the use of emotionally charged language and oversimplified arguments suggests a strong likelihood of propaganda intent.
