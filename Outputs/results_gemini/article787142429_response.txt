1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Carrie Severino describing the situation as a “last-minute attempt at character assassination,” which is an insulting label for the actions of the accuser and her supporters.
2. Repetition – No – The text presents a sequence of developing information and different statements rather than repeating the same message.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase “last-minute attempt at character assassination” is a brief and memorable phrase used to frame the entire event in a specific way.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear about what might happen if Kavanaugh is or is not confirmed.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text quotes Carrie Severino calling the accusation a “last-minute attempt,” which is intended to cast doubt on the timing and motive of the accuser. It also notes Kavanaugh’s friend has “no recollection,” which questions the accuser’s claim without directly refuting it.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The statement that the accusation is “nothing more than a last-minute attempt at character assassination” minimizes the potential gravity of the alleged assault by reducing it solely to a political motive.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use appeals to patriotism or national identity to make its case.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The phrase “character assassination” is emotionally loaded language designed to evoke a strong negative reaction and frame the accusers as malicious.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – There is no comparison of any idea or person to a group hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text states that “65 women from both the Republican and Democrat parties who have known Kavanaugh since high school defended his character,” appealing to the idea that a large group of people supports him.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text quotes Carrie Severino, who reduces the complex issue of a sexual assault allegation to a single, simple cause: it is “nothing more than a last-minute attempt at character assassination.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article is direct in reporting who said what and what the specific claims and denials are.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents Carrie Severino as “chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network” to lend authority to her statement. It also uses the 65 women as character authorities who have known Kavanaugh for a long time.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The quote “This is nothing more than a last-minute attempt at character assassination” presents only two options: the accusation is a legitimate claim of assault, or it is a political attack. The phrasing dismisses the former and presents the latter as the only possible truth.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “character assassination” is used as a thought-terminating cliché to shut down discussion about the substance of the allegation by simply labeling it as a political smear.
16. Red herring – No – All the information presented, including the political context and character references, is directly relevant to the story of the accusation.
17. Straw men – No – The text presents direct denials and counter-arguments to the accusation, not refutations of a misrepresented argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect by accusing the opposing side of hypocrisy on other matters.

Verdict – 80% – While the text adopts the structure of a news report by presenting an accusation and then a denial, it is highly propagandistic. The article dedicates a substantial portion of its length to the rebuttal of the claim, culminating in a powerful quote from a partisan source (the Judicial Crisis Network) that is itself a condensed package of numerous propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Slogans, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy). The article also heavily features the Bandwagon technique by citing the letter from "65 women." By giving the final, emphatic word to a source that frames the accusation as purely a political smear, the text moves beyond objective reporting and actively persuades the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint. The primary function is not just to inform about the accusation, but to convince the reader that the accusation is illegitimate.
