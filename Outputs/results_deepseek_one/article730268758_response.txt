Based on the definitions provided and analysis of the text, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling – Yes** – "predator priests" (labels accused clergy with an insulting term), "principal in a cover-up" (directly labels the Pope).
2. **Repetition – Yes** – Repeated emphasis on the Pope "ignoring" evidence (e.g., "ignored them all," "continues to shrug his shoulders").
3. **Slogans – No** – No brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries.  
4. **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Warnings about "sexual exploitation of children in a grooming gang" and regression to "square one" in child protection, implying dire consequences if the Pope’s actions persist.  
5. **Doubt – Yes** – Repeatedly questions Pope Francis’s credibility (e.g., "his professed empathy... has come into question," contradictions about receiving victim testimony).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration: "scandal of epic proportions," "extremely dangerous." Minimization: Downplays the Pope’s apology/response as "shrug his shoulders."  
7. **Flag-Waving – No** – No appeals to patriotism or group identity beyond the Catholic Church context.  
8. **Loaded Language – Yes** – Emotional terms like "heinous," "betrayed," "haunting this papacy," and "grooming gang" evoke strong reactions.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparisons to Nazis or universally despised groups.  
10. **Bandwagon – Yes** – References "many people," Chilean bishops, and petitions opposing the Pope to imply broad consensus (e.g., "Chilean Archbishop conference told him to revoke this appointment").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification – No** – Attributes the cover-up to the Pope’s actions but includes multiple factors (e.g., ignored letters, victim testimony), avoiding oversimplification.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – Specific details are provided (e.g., dates, names like Juan Barros, Scicluna investigation).  
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Relies on Elizabeth Yore’s expertise as an attorney/child advocate and Juan Carlos Cruz’s victim testimony to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents the Pope as either complicit ("principal in a cover-up") or neglectful ("ignored them all"), with no middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – No phrases used to shut down debate (e.g., "move on" is critiqued, not employed by the text).  
16. **Red herring – No** – Focus remains on the abuse cover-up; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men – No** – Accusations directly address the Pope’s documented actions (e.g., appointing Barros despite warnings).  
18. **Whataboutism – No** – No attempt to deflect by accusing others of hypocrisy.  

---

**Verdict – 75%** – The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements, primarily through **name-calling**, **loaded language**, **exaggeration**, and **bandwagon/appeal to authority** techniques to frame Pope Francis as knowingly complicit in abuse cover-ups. It selectively presents evidence (e.g., emphasizing ignored letters while minimizing the Scicluna investigation) and uses emotionally charged language (e.g., "heinous," "betrayed") to provoke outrage. However, it also includes verifiable facts (e.g., victim testimony, timeline of events) and cites specific sources, preventing it from being purely propaganda. The 75% likelihood reflects a persuasive intent to advance a narrative of papal misconduct, leveraging emotional manipulation and one-sided emphasis while retaining a foundation in reported events.
