3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Make America Great Again") are used.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No attempt to instill fear about alternatives; focus is on discrediting the accuser’s lawyer.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Where does PGO gets its funding?" questions POGO’s credibility by implying hidden motives.

10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to the popularity of an idea.

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely propaganda. It employs multiple techniques—**name-calling**, **loaded language**, **exaggeration**, **doubt**, **causal oversimplification**, and **red herring**—to discredit Kavanaugh’s accuser by attacking her lawyer’s affiliations (Soros, POGO) and political donations. This diverts attention from the assault allegation itself, framing it as a partisan "smear" orchestrated by shadowy left-wing forces. The tone ("What a surprise!") and selective emphasis on funding/donations (while downplaying POGO’s non-partisan update) reinforce an agenda to delegitimize the accuser without engaging substantively with her claims. The cumulative effect is manipulative persuasion, not factual discourse.
