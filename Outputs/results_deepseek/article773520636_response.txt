Based on the definitions provided and the text analysis, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique, followed by the final verdict:

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – Examples: "biblically illiterate," "confused," "ignorant and uneducated," "perverse, modern-day, professing Christians." These are insulting labels attacking the opposing author and Christians who advocate submission.  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Examples: The phrase "Absolutely not!" is repeated 5 times to reject submission to specific authorities; "Nowhere in Scripture" is repeated twice for emphasis.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – Examples: "Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God," "No King but King Jesus," and "REBELLION TO TYRANTS IS OBEDIENCE TO GOD" are used as memorable revolutionary phrases.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Example: Implies that submitting to "tyrants" leads to damnation (e.g., "submit to tyrants and resist God") and invokes historical persecution (e.g., martyrs killed by "corrupt authorities").  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Examples: Questions opponents' credibility, e.g., "this individual... knows nothing," "this individual... ought to have stayed home to read their Bible," "biblically illiterate are teaching others... submit to tyrants."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Example: Exaggerates the opposing view as advocating submission to all evil (e.g., "submit to those who lie... steal and even kill?"), minimizing nuanced interpretations of Romans 13.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Examples: Appeals to American patriotism via the Founding Fathers (e.g., "founding forefathers," "Declaration of Independence," "American Revolution," "US Constitution").  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Examples: Emotionally charged terms like "tyrant," "usurpations," "corrupt," "wicked," "perverse," "heresy," and "Satan twists Scripture."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Example: Appeals to the popularity of revolutionary ideals (e.g., "Our American history... teaches that our forefathers threw off the tyrant") and biblical heroes (Moses, Daniel).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Example: Reduces complex governance to "submit to evil vs. obey God" (e.g., "Representatives work for us, we do not work for them" ignores systemic complexities).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct, not obscure.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Examples: Cites the Bible (e.g., Ephesians 5:11), Founding Fathers (e.g., John Hancock), and historical figures (e.g., William Blackstone) as absolute authorities.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Example: Presents only two options: resist tyranny (good) or submit to evil (e.g., "Submit to what God condemns?"), ignoring middle-ground interpretations.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Examples: "Absolutely not!" and "Of course not!" are used to shut down debate; "Common sense does come into play here" dismisses counterarguments.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All examples (e.g., biblical stories, Founding Fathers) directly support the core argument about resisting tyranny.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Example: Misrepresents the opposing article as teaching blind submission to all authority (e.g., "submit to those who have sanctioned murder... lie... steal"), when the original likely addressed general submission.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy against opponents.

### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation:
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of persuasive techniques to oversimplify a theological-political debate, manipulate emotions, and delegitimize dissent. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language (e.g., "tyrant," "Satan twists Scripture") and fear appeals (e.g., damnation, historical persecution) dominate.  
- **Oversimplification**: Complex issues (biblical submission, civil disobedience) are reduced to a false binary (resist=good/submit=evil) via black-and-white fallacies and causal oversimplification.  
- **Source Discrediting**: Repeatedly attacks opponents’ credibility ("biblically illiterate," "ignorant") rather than engaging deeply with their arguments.  
- **Appeals to Identity**: Heavy reliance on American patriotism (Founding Fathers, Revolution) and Christian identity to rally support.  
- **Selective Authority**: Uses cherry-picked biblical/historical examples (e.g., Moses, Daniel) while dismissing counter-narratives (e.g., Romans 13:1–7 is framed as "twisted").  

While the text presents factual references (e.g., historical quotes, scripture), their framing is manipulative. The goal is clearly to persuade readers to reject submission to authority as "biblically illiterate" and align with a specific ideological stance (anti-tyranny activism), not to encourage balanced discourse. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges the text’s use of legitimate historical/theological material, but its execution aligns overwhelmingly with propagandistic objectives.
