**Verdict – 40% – The text contains elements of propaganda, particularly through the use of appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, minimization, and loaded language. These techniques are used to portray Douglas Haig and the conspiracy theories surrounding him in a certain light. However, the text also provides factual information and context about the situation, which reduces the overall likelihood of it being pure propaganda. The presence of some propaganda techniques suggests a moderate likelihood, but not a definitive case of propaganda.**
