---

**Verdict – 90%** – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 11 distinct propaganda techniques to frame Kavanaugh’s confirmation process as a coordinated, dishonest attack by Democrats ("the Left"). Loaded language ("show trial," "smear," "sleazeball") and name-calling dominate, while causal oversimplification and black/white fallacies vilify opponents. The narrative dismisses accusations as fabricated ("materialized out of thin air") and minimizes their severity ("dubious improprieties"), while exaggerating Democratic tactics. Appeals to authority (Goldstein) and bandwagoning ("insiders believe") lend false legitimacy. Though it contains factual elements (e.g., Senate margins, timing), these are embedded in a heavily slanted framework designed to delegitimize accusers and manipulate readers into siding with Kavanaugh/Republicans. The absence of neutral sourcing or acknowledgment of valid concerns confirms its propagandistic intent.
