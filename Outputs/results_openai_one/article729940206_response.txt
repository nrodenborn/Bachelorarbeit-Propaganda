Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and thought-terminating clichés. These techniques suggest a strong bias against sociology and the professor, aiming to discredit them and sway the reader's opinion. However, not all propaganda techniques are present, and the text does include some factual elements, such as the professor's response and the student's argument about Australia's status. Therefore, while the text is likely propaganda, it is not entirely devoid of factual content.
