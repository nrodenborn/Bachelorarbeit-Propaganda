Here's the analysis of the text against the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "cover-up", "drag his feet". These are insulting labels applied to the actions of the Clark County Coroner.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The text repeatedly emphasizes missing information: "all of the names were redacted", "no mention of ballistic data, bullet caliber, or trajectories", "still not released the autopsy report", "has still not released", "still has to 'finalize' the report".
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – The headline "Las Vegas Massacre Coverup" functions somewhat like a slogan, but the text itself doesn't contain a distinct, brief, memorable phrase used repetitively as a slogan within the body.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The implication is that authorities are hiding crucial information ("cover-up", "against public law", failure to release Paddock's report) about a deadly event, fostering fear and distrust of official institutions.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The entire text is structured to cast doubt on the official narrative and actions: "It appears that a further cover-up is underway", questioning the release of reports, questioning the identity of the body ("definitively proved the body recovered... was not Paddock’s"), questioning the reason for delaying Paddock's report.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "definitively proved the body recovered... was not Paddock’s" is a strong claim presented without evidence within the text, likely an exaggeration. Minimization occurs by implying the coroner's reason for not releasing Paddock's report (needing to finalize it) is invalid or a cover-up.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No appeal to patriotism or group identity is present.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "cover-up", "drag his feet", "against public law", "definitively proved" are emotionally charged terms designed to provoke suspicion and outrage.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Hitler, Nazis, or universally hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to the popularity of the idea is made.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – The text implies the complex event (withholding information, redactions) is solely due to a deliberate "cover-up" by the coroner, ignoring other potential bureaucratic, legal, or procedural reasons.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – "against public law" is vague and unspecific (which law?). "definitively proved" is stated without describing the proof, making it obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text appeals to the authority of an "Intellihub article" as definitive proof ("definitively proved") about Paddock's body, without providing the evidence itself.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – The text frames the situation as a binary choice: either there is a deliberate, illegal cover-up ("cover-up", "against public law", "definitively proved") OR the official actions/reasons are completely truthful and above board. It dismisses potential nuance or legitimate reasons.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" or "just the way things are" used to shut down inquiry are present.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The focus shifts significantly to the missing Stephen Paddock autopsy report and the claim about his body's identity ("definitively proved... was not Paddock’s"), which is a separate issue, distracting from the initial point about the redacted victim reports and missing ballistics.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text doesn't explicitly refute an argument that wasn't presented. It attacks the coroner's actions and stated reasons directly.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No charge of hypocrisy is made against an opponent.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on **Name Calling**, **Loaded Language**, and creating **Doubt** to frame the situation as a deliberate "cover-up". It uses **Repetition** of missing elements, **Appeal to Fear** regarding hidden truths, **Exaggeration** (especially "definitively proved"), **Causal Oversimplification** (blaming solely on cover-up), **Obfuscation** (vague references to law and proof), **Appeal to Authority** (Intellihub article), **Black & White Fallacy** (cover-up or truth), and a **Red Herring** (shifting focus to Paddock's body). While it reports factual events (release of redacted reports, missing Paddock report), the language, framing, selective emphasis, and unsubstantiated claims are overwhelmingly designed to promote a specific, conspiratorial narrative and manipulate the reader's perception, rather than provide a neutral or thoroughly evidenced report. The lack of concrete evidence for the strongest claims ("definitively proved") is particularly telling.
