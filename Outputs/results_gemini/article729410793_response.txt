1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Cardinal Cordes describing Cardinal Marx’s idea as “truly…sacrilegious,” which is an insulting label in a religious context.
2. Repetition – Yes – The central message that blessing same-sex unions is contrary to Church teaching is repeated through the words of Cardinal Cordes (“contradicts the Will of God”), the Catechism (“under no circumstances…be approved”), and Archbishop Chaput (“cooperate in a morally forbidden act”).
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the brief and memorable phrase from the Catechism describing homosexual acts as “intrinsically disordered.”
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text supports its position by instilling fear of spiritual harm, quoting Archbishop Chaput’s warning that such a blessing would be “spiritually damaging” and “leads persons away from God.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The article questions the credibility of Cardinal Marx’s clarification about his comments, stating, “However, the German Bishops’ Conference doesn’t seem to deny the rest of his statements,” thereby casting doubt on the sincerity or completeness of the correction.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The description of Marx’s proposal for pastoral care as “truly…sacrilegious” exaggerates its nature, while the article minimizes the official correction from Marx’s office by immediately questioning its significance.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific Catholic identity by constantly referencing foundational authorities and texts, such as when Cordes states, “The Church is in its pastoral care bound to Holy Scripture and to its interpretation through the Church’s Magisterium.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language, such as “sacrilegious,” “intrinsically disordered,” and “engaging in sodomy,” to evoke a strong emotional response.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare the opposing viewpoint to Nazis or any other group widely hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The article does not claim a position is right because it is popular; instead, it relies on appeals to authority and tradition.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the motives of same-sex couples, stating they “aim with their request at the recognition and acceptance of their homosexual way of life,” ignoring other complex potential reasons like a desire for God’s guidance.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article itself is written with a clear point of view and does not use vague expressions to confuse the audience; rather, it accuses Cardinal Marx of doing so.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article’s entire argument is built on citing authorities, including Cardinal Cordes, Archbishop Chaput, the “Catechism of the Catholic Church,” and “Holy Scripture.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: adhering to the “truth” of Church teaching or blessing an action that “leads persons away from God,” ignoring any potential for a nuanced pastoral approach.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The article uses the phrase, “Jesus said the truth will make us free. Nowhere did he suggest it will make us comfortable,” to shut down discussion about pastoral sensitivity by framing it as a mere desire for comfort over truth.
16. Red herring – Yes – The extended section on the dispute over whether CNA mistranslated Cardinal Marx serves as a distraction from the core theological issue, only to conclude the dispute is minor, making it an irrelevant diversion used to cast doubt.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that may not have been made by stating that those seeking a blessing are not looking for “God’s assistance” but for “recognition and acceptance,” misrepresenting their potential intentions to make them easier to condemn.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text attacks Cardinal Marx’s position directly and does not try to discredit him by charging him with hypocrisy on an unrelated matter.

Verdict – 95% – The text is presented in the format of a news article, but its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint. This is achieved by overwhelmingly using one side's sources (Cordes, Chaput, the Catechism) to frame the issue. The article employs a vast number of propaganda techniques, including loaded language (“sacrilegious,” “sodomy”), appeals to fear (leading people “away from God”), name-calling, and creating a black-and-white fallacy between "truth" and sin. The sheer density of these techniques, found in nearly every paragraph, demonstrates a clear intent to construct a persuasive argument rather than a balanced report, making it highly propagandistic.
