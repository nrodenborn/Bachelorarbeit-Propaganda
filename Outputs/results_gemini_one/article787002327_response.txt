Here are the propaganda techniques and whether they are present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses insulting labels to attack its opponents, such as "leftist totalitarians," "leftist brownshirt-style assault," "SPLC hate machine," and "the Stalinist Left."

2.  Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the idea that the ban was only lifted due to publicity. First, it says, "...the ban has only been lifted because of the publicity that we engaged in," and later, "It goes without saying that this retraction and surrender by Facebook occurred only because of the wide publicity that Jamie's banning had received."

3.  Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief, memorable phrase to be repeated by the audience. It references the slogan of another group (#WalkAway) but does not create or use one of its own.

4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by framing the situation as an existential threat, stating, "The battle for America -- and for the West -- is on," and describing a "pernicious assault by the fascist Left on our liberties."

5.  Doubt – Yes – The text explicitly questions the credibility of Facebook's official reason for lifting the ban: "We have no doubt, of course, that no “mistake” had actually occurred in this matter and that the ban has only been lifted because of the publicity that we engaged in -- and received."

6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of the events by describing a temporary social media ban as a "totalitarian attack" and part of the "Stalinist Left's war on America."

7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a fight for core national values: "The battle for America -- and for the West -- is on," and an "assault by the fascist Left on our liberties."

8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to evoke a strong reaction, such as "Jihadist Psychopath," "totalitarian plantation," "tyrannical behavior," "Unholy Alliance masters," and "vicious lie."

9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of its opponents by associating them with hated groups, specifically using the terms "leftist brownshirt-style assault" and "fascistic manner," which directly allude to Nazism.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text appeals to popularity by listing numerous other conservative figures and outlets that support their cause, creating the impression of a large and growing movement: "Leading brave conservative figures such as Michelle Malkin and Laura Loomer also stood up for Jamie, tweeting about his ban."

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes a complex issue (content moderation on social media) to a single, simple cause: a deliberate, malicious, and coordinated "totalitarian attack on the free speech of conservatives" by "the Left."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; it is very direct and clear in its accusations and identifies specific groups and individuals as the source of the perceived problem.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites figures who are authorities within its target audience to lend credibility to its claims, such as "Leading scholar of Islam and JihadWatch.org Director Robert Spencer" and "Leading brave conservative figures such as Michelle Malkin and Laura Loomer."

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a simple conflict between two opposing sides with no room for nuance: the "brave conservative truth-tellers" on one side, and the "fascist Left" and "leftist totalitarians" on the other.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses labels that discourage critical thought about the opposition by framing them as unequivocally evil, such as "the fascist Left" and "Stalinist Left," which dismisses any need to consider their perspective.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces numerous other cases of alleged censorship (Alex Jones, Robert Spencer, Prager U, the David Horowitz Freedom Center) to distract from the specific details of Glazov's ban and create a broader narrative of widespread persecution.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that Facebook did not make. It frames the ban as Facebook being against "giving advice on how to prevent another 9/11," which is an easily defeated misrepresentation of a likely more nuanced community standards violation.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse its opponents of hypocrisy by pointing out similar actions they have taken. Instead, it focuses on direct attacks and name-calling.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to objectively inform the reader about an event, but to persuade them to adopt a specific, highly polarized worldview and to take action (buy a book, follow social media accounts, contact representatives). It achieves this by employing an overwhelming number of propaganda techniques. The piece is saturated with loaded, emotional language (Name Calling, Loaded Language) and comparisons to hated totalitarian regimes (Reduction ad Hitlerum) to demonize the opposition. It constructs its argument using logical fallacies, including a stark Black & White Fallacy that divides the world into noble heroes and evil villains, a Straw Man to misrepresent Facebook's actions, and Causal Oversimplification to blame a vast "leftist" conspiracy for all grievances. The constant appeals to fear and patriotism (Flag-Waving), combined with a Bandwagon appeal listing supporters, are designed to rally the reader to its side in what it frames as an existential "battle for America." The text is not a news report; it is a call to arms built on a foundation of classic propaganda strategies.
