Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Globalist billionaire George Soros" (Using "globalist" as a pejorative label implying disloyalty to national interests).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The core idea of Soros funding lawyers helping the caravan is repeated in the headline, the first sentence, and later paragraphs. The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – The text doesn't contain a distinct, memorable phrase used as a slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Descriptions like "rush the border", "invasion", "perceived threat", photos of CBP in "riot gear" and "barbed wire", and the military deployment with "drones" and "helicopters with night-vision" are used to instill fear about the migrants and the border situation.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "mostly consists of migrants with ineligible asylum claims, which include job-seekers, previously deported illegal aliens, and Central Americans looking to get away from crime. None of these are eligible asylum claims" (Questions the legitimacy of the migrants' asylum claims).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – *Exaggeration:* Describing the caravan as an "invasion" and framing legal asylum application assistance as part of a "perceived threat". *Minimization:* Downplaying the lawyer's statement that "70 percent had credible cases on the surface" by immediately emphasizing "Yet many lack the documents".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – The focus on defending the US border ("blocking the lanes, deploying additional personnel", military deployment details) and thanking CBP/DHS frames actions as patriotic duty.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Numerous examples: "Globalist", "under the guise of seeking asylum", "rush the border", "illegal aliens", "invasion", "perceived threat". These words carry strong negative connotations and appeal to emotion/stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Associating the migrant assistance lawyers with "George Soros", a figure frequently demonized and portrayed as a malign globalist force by certain groups, implies the assistance is inherently bad because of this association.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text doesn't explicitly appeal to the popularity of an idea to persuade.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Implies the complex phenomenon of the migrant caravan and asylum seeking is primarily caused by "Soros-funded lawyers" aiding them ("Attorneys backed by George Soros are helping caravan migrants get asylum").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is relatively direct in its claims, though some claims lack specific sourcing (e.g., "reports that they plan to 'rush' the border", "mostly consists of migrants with ineligible asylum claims").
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's tweet and actions, and references Breitbart News reports multiple times, using them as supporting evidence for its claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – The text doesn't explicitly present only two stark choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – The text doesn't use phrases specifically designed to shut down critical thought within itself.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The entire poll section about Jim Acosta and press passes is completely irrelevant to the topic of the migrant caravan and Soros-funded lawyers, serving only as a distraction.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text doesn't explicitly refute an argument not actually made by an opponent.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text doesn't charge an opponent with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a significant number of classic propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Reduction ad Hitlerum, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Red Herring) to advance a specific, highly slanted narrative. The core narrative frames George Soros as a nefarious funder helping a threatening "invasion" of mostly illegitimate asylum seekers, using emotionally charged and fear-inducing language. The inclusion of the irrelevant Jim Acosta poll further demonstrates a manipulative intent to distract and engage the audience on unrelated culture-war issues. While it reports some factual events (e.g., migrant numbers, DHS actions, lawyer presence), the selection of facts, the framing, the language used, and the inclusion of the red herring poll are all designed to persuade and inflame rather than objectively inform.
