Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "Muslim rape gang" is used as an insulting label for the subjects of the trial Robinson was reporting on.
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The phrase "Free Tommy Robinson now!" is repeated multiple times at the end.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "Free Tommy Robinson now!" is a brief, memorable phrase used to rally support.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "The Sharia is being implemented in the United Kingdom and the Muslims are ready to seek total control." Instills fear of Islam and Sharia law taking over.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "Robinson was denied due process, according to the judge." Questions the credibility and fairness of the UK legal system regarding Robinson's case.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration: "Robinson was arrested, tried, and sentenced to 13 months within an hour for simply reporting..." Minimizes Robinson's actions as harmless "simply reporting" while exaggerating the speed and severity as a sign of tyranny. Also, "total control" exaggerates Muslim influence.
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – "It is sad to see how Britain, the cradle of Western democracy and the rule of law, is fast descending into tyranny." Appeals to British identity and democratic values.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Words like "tyranny", "disgrace", "hero", "gag", "plot to get rid of him", "criminal elements", "total control" evoke strong emotions (fear, anger, admiration) and stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes** – "Such measures are common practice in North Korea and Saudi Arabia." Compares UK actions to those of regimes hated by the audience to disapprove of them.
10. **Bandwagon – Yes** – "Free Tommy Robinson protests are set for this weekend, and Dutch MP Geert Wilders has said he will join those protests." Implies support is growing and popular, encouraging others to join.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – "The Sharia is being implemented in the United Kingdom... The latest evidence of that fact is the suspension of a firefighter..." Presents the firefighter's suspension and Robinson's imprisonment as simple, direct evidence of Sharia implementation, ignoring complex legal, social, and political factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – While biased and inflammatory, the text's core claims (suspension, imprisonment, protests) are stated directly, not obscured. Phrases like "this is what this is" are vague but not deliberately confusing *about the technique itself*.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – "Dutch MP Geert Wilders has said... 'Tommy is a hero. It is a disgrace that he is still in jail.'" Uses Wilders' position and statement as evidence/support.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – The text frames the situation as a binary choice: either support figures like Robinson who "expose" Islamists, or accept Sharia implementation, tyranny, and the suppression of truth ("expose the Islamists... or... find yourself in jail"). Ignores nuanced positions.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "Tommy is a hero." and "Free Tommy Robinson now!" are simple, definitive phrases that shut down critical examination of Robinson's actions or legal situation.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – Introducing the story of Paul Golding's attack in prison ("In March, we reported on Britain First's Paul Golding was attacked...") is irrelevant to the core narrative about the firefighter's suspension and Robinson's case, but serves to bolster the fear of persecution for anti-Islam views.
17. **Straw men – No** – The text doesn't explicitly refute an argument that wasn't presented. It attacks the legal system and perceived Islamification, but doesn't misrepresent a specific opposing argument.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The text doesn't directly charge critics with hypocrisy by pointing to their own misdeeds or inconsistent positions. The Golding reference is a red herring, not a direct charge of hypocrisy against opponents.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It employs a vast array of propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Reduction ad Hitlerum, Bandwagon, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-Terminating Clichés, and Red Herring) to promote a specific, alarmist narrative about Sharia law taking over the UK and the persecution of those like Tommy Robinson who oppose it. The core message is driven by fear, emotion, oversimplification, demonization of Muslims, and the glorification of Robinson, while presenting a distorted view of events and ignoring counter-evidence or complex realities. Its primary purpose is to persuade and inflame, not to provide a balanced or factual account. The minor reservation (5%) acknowledges that the text reports on actual events (a firefighter suspension, Robinson's imprisonment, planned protests) but frames them within a heavily propagandistic structure.
