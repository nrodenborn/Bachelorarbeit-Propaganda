1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Donald Trump calling the investigation a “Rigged Witch Hunt” and Robert Mueller’s team “17 angry Democrats” who are a “disgrace to USA!”
2. Repetition – Yes – The phrase “Rigged Witch Hunt” is repeated multiple times throughout the text, both in the headline and in the quoted tweets from Donald Trump.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text quotes Donald Trump using the phrase “Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!” and another Twitter user saying “Lock them all up”.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text quotes Donald Trump suggesting the investigation will “stain our country any further,” which instills fear about the consequences of allowing the investigation to continue.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text quotes Donald Trump questioning the credibility of the investigation by stating, “Bob Mueller is totally conflicted,” and quoting Alan Dershowitz who says, “Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text quotes Donald Trump’s lawyers minimizing the tweets by saying they are just an expression of “opinion” and “not a call to action.” Conversely, Trump’s claim that Mueller is “totally conflicted” is an example of exaggeration.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text quotes Donald Trump claiming the investigators are a “disgrace to USA!” and another user claiming the investigation is an attempt to “stop the will of We the People!!!”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases quoted from the tweets, such as “rigged,” “witch hunt,” “angry Democrats,” and “dirty work.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not contain any examples of disapproving an idea by suggesting it is popular with a group like the Nazis or other similarly hated figures.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The article states, “And Trump is far from the only American who sees the investigation as a witch hunt. Many Twitter users have taken his side…”
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – A quoted tweet simplifies the complex Mueller investigation by claiming, “This is just a deep state coo attempt (Mueller) to stop the will of We the People!!!”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The statements quoted in the text are generally direct and not deliberately obscure. The article itself strives for clarity in reporting the events.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text shows Donald Trump quoting law professor Alan Dershowitz to lend credibility to his claims. The article also quotes Senator Patrick Leahy, a former prosecutor, to provide a counter-argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The article’s final paragraph frames the situation as a debate between “opinion vs. ‘obstruction of justice’,” which simplifies a complex legal and political issue. A quoted tweet also presents a false dichotomy: “It's time to jail Mueller and cancel this witch hunt!!!”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The quoted tweet from “Comfortably Smug” uses the phrase “Enough is enough!!!” to shut down discussion. The term “Rigged Witch Hunt” also functions as a cliché to dismiss the investigation without critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text quotes Trump heavily focusing on the actions and alleged bias of FBI Agent Peter Strzok to distract from the main subject of the investigation, which is Russian collusion and potential obstruction of justice by the president himself.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text quotes Trump focusing on how “Mueller is going to protect these guys” (referring to people like Peter Strzok). This refutes a non-existent argument, as the primary purpose of the Mueller report was not to investigate internal FBI conduct but to investigate Russian interference in the election.
18. Whataboutism – No – While the text includes accusations against others (like Peter Strzok), it does not frame these accusations as a direct response to a charge against Trump in the form of “what about…” to allege hypocrisy.

Verdict – 70% – The text functions strongly as propaganda, although it maintains a thin veneer of objective reporting. The article is ostensibly a news report about a series of tweets, but its structure and content heavily amplify the propagandistic messages within those tweets. The headline is a direct, inflammatory quote from Trump, immediately framing the article from his perspective. The vast majority of the article's word count is dedicated to quoting or paraphrasing Trump and his supporters, who use a wide array of propaganda techniques (name-calling, loaded language, appeal to fear, etc.). While the article does include counter-points from Trump's lawyers, Senator Leahy, and a mention of The New York Times, these are given significantly less space and prominence. This selective presentation creates the effect of disseminating and reinforcing a particular political narrative under the guise of journalism. The inclusion of the bandwagon technique ("And Trump is far from the only American who sees...") by the article's author further pushes the piece from reporting into persuasion. Therefore, while it is not a pure, one-sided propaganda piece, its framing and emphasis make it highly propagandistic.
