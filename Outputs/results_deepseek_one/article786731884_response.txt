Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Stalinist" (used to describe Facebook’s actions), "Shariah barbarities," "totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces," "Shariah enforcers and oppressors."  
2. **Repetition** – **No** – No significant repetition of phrases or ideas beyond standard thematic emphasis.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL" equivalent).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings of "jihadist stabbings," "another 9/11," "totalitarian plantation," and "suffocation of free thought" instill fear about safety and freedom.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions Facebook’s motives: *"what it is specifically that violates Facebook’s ‘community standards’"* implies hidden agendas.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: Facebook’s actions described as *"surreal in the creepiest and most harrowing Stalinist sense."* Minimization: Oversimplifies CAIR/ISNA as "Muslim Brotherhood front groups."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to American identity: *"defend American lives from jihad,"* *"our civilization,"* and references to the Constitution.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotionally charged terms: *"devouring us,"* *"Shariah barbarities,"* *"totalitarian suffocation,"* *"hatred,"* *"oppressors."*  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis; "Stalinist" references Soviet totalitarianism, not Nazi Germany.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – No claims that a single simple action (e.g., banning Facebook) would solve complex issues like jihadism.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Language is direct; no deliberate ambiguity.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – No authoritative figures cited to validate claims (Glazov is the subject, not an authority invoked for proof).  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents Facebook as either supporting free speech or being pro-Shariah enforcers: *"clearly on the side of the Shariah enforcers."*  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Focus remains on Facebook’s censorship; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Facebook’s position (censoring for "community standards") is not misrepresented; it’s directly criticized.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., "What about Twitter?" is not used to deflect).  

---

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs multiple techniques—including **name-calling**, **appeal to fear**, **loaded language**, **black-and-white fallacy**, and **exaggeration**—to vilify Facebook and Islamic groups while promoting Glazov’s book. The language is emotionally charged (*"devouring us," "Stalinist," "barbarities"*), frames dissent as treasonous (*"totalitarian suffocation"*), and oversimplifies nuanced issues (e.g., labeling all Muslim organizations as extremist). Though it references real events (Facebook’s ban), its primary aim is to provoke outrage against perceived enemies (leftists, Muslims, tech companies) and boost Glazov’s ideological and commercial agenda. The editorial framing (*"pre-order Jamie’s book"*) and selective outrage (ignoring context for bans) further confirm its persuasive intent. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges factual elements (e.g., Facebook’s suspension), but these are weaponized for propaganda.
