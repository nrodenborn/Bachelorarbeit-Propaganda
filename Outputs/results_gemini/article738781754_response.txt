1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Rand Paul describing Gina Haspel as having expressed “joyful glee” at being involved in torture programs, which is an attack on her character.
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat the same message or phrase multiple times.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire premise of the article is to cast doubt on the nominees, quoting Senator McCain who “wanted answers about Haspel’s background” and Paul who is “perplexed by the nomination.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text quotes Paul’s description of Haspel having “joyful glee” at torture, which is a potential exaggeration to create a stronger negative image.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or groups hated by the audience.

11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not propose a simple cause for a complex event.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – While the term “deep state” can be vague, the article is generally direct and not intentionally confusing.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article centers its entire argument on the authority of U.S. Senators (Rand Paul and John McCain) to lend credibility to the opposition against the nominees.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text describes a political situation and does not present a false dichotomy to the reader.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down debate.
16. Red herring – No – All the information presented is relevant to the central topic of the nominations and the opposition to them.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not create and refute a false argument from the opposing side.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text quotes Rand Paul charging President Trump with hypocrisy by pointing out that his nominations contradict what he “campaigned on.”

Verdict – 85% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it reports on factual events (Trump’s tweet, Paul’s statements), it is not a balanced news report. It is published by an outlet with a clear ideological name ("Personal Liberty") and exclusively presents a one-sided narrative aimed at persuading the reader to oppose Trump's nominees. It employs a significant number of propaganda techniques, most notably Loaded Language (“torture programs,” “deep state”), Appeal to Fear (the threat of a “war with Iran”), and Appeal to Authority (basing the entire argument on the statements of two senators). The piece frames the issue not as a complex political decision but as a clear-cut case of principled senators standing up against war, torture, and a president betraying his own platform. The lack of any balancing viewpoint or comment from supporters of the nominees confirms its purpose as persuasion rather than objective reporting.
