### Verdict – 85%  
**Explanation**:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of persuasive techniques to advance a specific narrative. Key indicators include:  
- **Selective evidence**: Heavy reliance on leaked emails (presented without context) and a partisan Breitbart study while ignoring counter-evidence.  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded language ("caught red-handed," "sham") and fear appeals frame Google as a villain undermining democracy.  
- **Authority bias**: Tucker Carlson and Breitbart are presented as definitive sources despite their ideological leanings.  
- **Oversimplification**: Reduces Clinton’s 2016 loss primarily to Google’s actions, ignoring multifaceted election factors.  
- **Intent**: Aims to delegitimize Google/Clinton and validate conservative claims of "election interference," aligning with known partisan narratives.  

While it cites verifiable sources (e.g., emails), their interpretation is skewed to fuel distrust. The absence of neutral analysis or opposing viewpoints confirms its propagandistic purpose. However, it is not 100% propaganda as some facts (e.g., Schmidt’s emails) are documented, though framed manipulatively.
