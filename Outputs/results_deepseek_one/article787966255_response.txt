Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text refers to Guyger as a "killer cop" (Paragraph 14: "...they don’t have to fear a killer cop walking into their apartment...").
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans are present. "Lives matter" is used in a quote but not as a slogan within the article's own narrative.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text invokes fear about police conduct and injustice, specifically stating residents "don’t have to fear a killer cop walking into their apartment and murdering them" (Paragraph 14).
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text repeatedly questions police actions and fairness: "Had anyone else but a cop walked into an apartment and killed an innocent man, do you believe that investigators would have said anything like this?" (Paragraph 5), "...the affidavit isn’t written objectively..." (Paragraph 6), and the overall theme of "special treatment".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "attempted to assassinate Jean’s character" (Paragraph 10) is hyperbolic, framing the release of marijuana information as a deliberate character assassination attempt.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: There is no appeal to patriotism, national identity, or group identity (like "We the People") within the text's arguments.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Emotionally charged words and phrases are used throughout: "slaying," "special treatment," "insidious," "egregiously," "assassinate Jean’s character," "killer cop," "injustice," "smear".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or universally hated groups are made to disapprove of an idea.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or claim that "everyone is doing it" to persuade.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text doesn't attribute a complex event (like Jean's death or the investigation) to a single, simple cause. It lists multiple points of contention.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is relatively direct in its accusations and reporting of facts (like the search warrants). It doesn't use deliberately confusing or obscure language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text cites Attorney Stephen Le Brocq's opinion ("sums up the treatment of Guyger perfectly") as evidence supporting its claim of biased investigation (Paragraphs 6-8).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: The attorney is quoted as saying affidavits "are usually wholly against the accused" (Paragraph 7), implying affidavits are *always* biased against the accused, presenting only two options (wholly against or not), ignoring nuance.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: No phrases are used to shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is," "that's just common sense"). Arguments are presented and discussed.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the Guyger case, the investigation, and the alleged special treatment. The Nikki Haley poll is an unrelated distraction *within* the page layout, but it's not used as an argumentative tactic *within* the article text itself to divert from the main topic.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text argues against the actual actions of the police and the affidavit's wording. It doesn't misrepresent an opposing argument to refute it easily.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not charge its opponents (police, investigators) with hypocrisy by pointing to their own past misdeeds. It focuses on their specific actions in *this* case.

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits a significant number of propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy). It uses emotionally charged language ("slaying," "assassinate character," "killer cop," "injustice"), repetition of an unrelated poll, name-calling, appeals to fear and doubt regarding police bias, exaggeration of intent, reliance on an authority figure, and oversimplification of legal processes. While it reports factual details (like the search warrants and Guyger moving out), the framing, selection of details (emphasizing Jean's searched apartment vs. Guyger's unsearched one, the marijuana), and consistent use of loaded terms clearly aim to persuade the reader towards a specific narrative of systemic bias and injustice favoring the police officer, rather than presenting a strictly neutral report. The presence of the repeated poll and its "access" incentive also suggests an agenda beyond pure news reporting. However, it is grounded in a real event and reports verifiable facts, preventing a 100% verdict.
