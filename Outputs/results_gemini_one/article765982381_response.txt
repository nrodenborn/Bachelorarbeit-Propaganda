1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels journalists who do not support Assange as “Vichy journalists,” a term used to compare them to the French government that collaborated with the Nazis.
2. Repetition – Yes – The central message that Julian Assange is a persecuted truth-teller and that the mainstream media is silent or complicit is reinforced and repeated throughout the article in different ways.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the phrase “Long live the Fifth Estate!” as a rallying cry.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that if organizations like WikiLeaks did not exist to leak information, devastating events like the 9/11 attacks might not be averted, creating fear about the consequences of suppressing such outlets.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text uses rhetorical questions to cast doubt on the integrity of its targets, such as, “One might ask, is ‘unseemly sycophancy’ at work among the media?” and “Sound familiar?”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the legal case against Assange by stating his “only ‘crime’ is publishing documents” while simultaneously exaggerating the importance of WikiLeaks by claiming “No investigative journalism in my lifetime can equal the importance of what WikiLeaks has done.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by describing the source of the “Collateral Murder” video as “far more a patriot than the ‘mainstream’ journalist” and by invoking the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as “scurrilous slander campaign,” “rapacious power,” “ruthless suppression,” and “deafening silence.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text explicitly uses the term “‘Vichy journalists — after the Vichy government that served ad enabled the German occupation of France,’” directly linking journalists it disapproves of with Nazi collaborators.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that Assange is popular and that the reader should join the crowd. Instead, it argues that he is unjustly persecuted and that more people *should* support him.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex legal and political situation surrounding Julian Assange to a single, simple cause: “his only ‘crime’ is publishing documents exposing the criminal activities and corruption of governments.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct in its claims and accusations. It does not use vague or confusing language to make its point.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites multiple figures and groups to support its position, including John Pilger, Harold Pinter, Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, and the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a world of two choices: you are either a heroic truth-teller like Assange and his supporters, or you are a complicit “Vichy journalist” enabling corruption. It offers no middle ground.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase, “You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free,” as a way to sanctify the actions of WikiLeaks and shut down any critical discussion of its methods or consequences.
16. Red herring – Yes – The extensive and detailed story of Cardinal Mindszenty, while used for an analogy, serves as a red herring to distract from the specific facts of Assange's case and create an emotional parallel that is not directly relevant.
17. Straw men – Yes – By framing Assange's situation as his “only ‘crime’ is publishing documents,” the text refutes a simplified version of the arguments against him, ignoring more complex legal arguments and criticisms to more easily defend his position.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The entire comparison to Cardinal Mindszenty is a form of whataboutism, structured to charge the West with hypocrisy: “You praised Mindszenty for this, so what about Assange?”

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a very specific, one-sided viewpoint. This is achieved through the heavy and combined use of a vast majority of the propaganda techniques listed.

The entire article is built upon a central analogy (Cardinal Mindszenty) that functions as a red herring, an appeal to whataboutism, and a way to frame Assange in a saintly, heroic light. It systematically employs loaded language (“scurrilous slander,” “rapacious power”) and name-calling (“Vichy journalists”) to demonize opponents and create a strong emotional response.

The argument relies on logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy (you are either a hero or a collaborator), causal oversimplification (Assange's "only crime"), and straw men (ignoring the complex legal arguments against him). It completely omits any information that might complicate its narrative, such as the sexual assault allegations against Assange in Sweden, which were a key part of his initial legal troubles.

By appealing to authorities (John Pilger, Nobel laureates) and patriotic ideals (the First Amendment, the definition of a "patriot"), the text attempts to lend its biased viewpoint an air of credibility. The sheer number of propaganda techniques used in concert demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than engage in a balanced and factual discussion.
