### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are directly applied to the targets (e.g., Obama/Clinton are criticized but not labeled with epithets like "crook" or "traitor").  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The core message of unequal justice is repeated: Saucier states, "They didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton... Hillary is still walking free," and Daigle reiterates, "We’ll highlight the differences... two-tier justice system."  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – The phrase "two-tier justice system" is used as a memorable, emotionally charged slogan to encapsulate the argument.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No attempt to instill fear about future consequences; the focus is on past alleged injustices.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Saucier questions the credibility of the Obama DOJ: "My prosecution was politically motivated... They used me as an example because of Hillary Clinton."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Saucier minimizes his actions ("service mementos") while prosecutors (cited in text) exaggerate them ("disgruntled sailor who put national security at risk").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms like "two-tier justice system," "singled out," and "treated very unfairly" frame the narrative.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association of opponents with universally hated groups (e.g., Nazis).  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to the popularity of Saucier’s lawsuit or Trump’s pardons.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes Saucier’s prosecution solely to Clinton-related politics: "They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton," ignoring other legal factors.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Arguments are stated directly (e.g., unequal prosecution claims), not obscured.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Trump’s support is noted but not used as evidence for the lawsuit’s validity.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents justice as binary: Saucier was "criminal" while Clinton "walk[s] free," ignoring nuances (e.g., intent, evidence differences).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Two-tier justice system" shuts down deeper analysis of legal complexities.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All examples (e.g., Clinton comparison, D’Souza pardon) directly support the core claim of unequal treatment.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Refutes actual arguments (e.g., prosecutors’ claim of national security risk) rather than misrepresenting them.  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Defends D’Souza’s pardon by shifting focus: "The Obama administration singled out Dinesh for things most people don’t even get charged for," implying hypocrisy.  

### Verdict – 70% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text exhibits **strong propagandistic elements** (70% likelihood) but is not purely propaganda. It uses multiple techniques—including **repetition**, **loaded language**, **causal oversimplification**, and **whataboutism**—to frame a narrative of systemic injustice against conservatives under Obama, while downplaying counterarguments (e.g., differences between Saucier’s deliberate photographing of classified systems vs. Clinton’s email mismanagement). Key indicators:  
- **One-sided framing**: Focuses exclusively on Saucier’s/D’Souza’s grievances, ignoring legal distinctions (e.g., Saucier destroyed evidence; Clinton’s case lacked intent proof).  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded terms ("two-tier justice," "treated very unfairly") stoke resentment.  
- **Oversimplification**: Reduces complex legal decisions to political targeting.  
However, it **avoids outright falsehoods**, citing factual events (Saucier’s conviction, Trump’s pardons). The propagandistic intent lies in **selective emphasis and framing** to delegitimize Obama-era officials, aligning with Trump’s "drain the swamp" rhetoric. The 30% non-propaganda weight reflects the inclusion of verifiable details (e.g., Saucier’s job loss, foreclosure) that humanize him without overt manipulation. Overall, the text serves a persuasive agenda by cherry-picking comparisons to fuel a partisan narrative.
