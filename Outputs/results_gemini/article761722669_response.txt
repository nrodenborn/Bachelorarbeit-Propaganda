6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Clinton minimizes the current relevance of the affair by saying it was ‘litigated 20 years ago.’ He also exaggerates his financial hardship, claiming, ‘I left the White House $16 million in debt,’ a statement the article immediately contrasts with his current wealth.

14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text presents multiple viewpoints and does not reduce the situation to only two possible options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – James Patterson attempts to shut down the line of questioning with phrases like, ‘It's 20 years ago, come on!’ and ‘Stop already!’
16. Red herring – Yes – Clinton introduces an irrelevant topic to distract from the question about his own actions, saying the focus is on him because ‘they're frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office.’

18. Whataboutism – Yes – Both Patterson and Clinton deflect criticism by charging hypocrisy and pointing to the actions of other presidents: ‘Let's talk about JFK. Let's talk about, you know, LBJ. Stop already!’

Verdict – 85% – The text is a news report that is heavily biased and uses numerous propaganda techniques to frame its subject, Bill Clinton, in a negative light. While its primary purpose might be to report on an interview, its execution goes beyond neutral reporting. The article employs loaded language (‘Don Juan-like seductions,’ ‘lothario habits’), name-calling, and strategic minimization/exaggeration to shape the reader's opinion. Furthermore, the article's main substance is reporting on Bill Clinton's own use of propaganda techniques during the interview, such as whataboutism (invoking JFK and LBJ), bandwagon (‘Two-thirds of the American people sided with me’), red herrings (bringing up Donald Trump), and doubt. Because both the journalistic framing and the subject matter being reported on are saturated with these techniques, the text functions as a piece of propaganda intended to reinforce a specific, critical narrative about Bill Clinton.
