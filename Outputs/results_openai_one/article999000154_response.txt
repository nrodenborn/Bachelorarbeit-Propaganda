Certainly! Here is the analysis for each propaganda technique according to your instructions:

---

**1. Name calling – Yes –** The text refers to Ilhan Omar as a “Muslima” and accuses her of “Islamic Jew-hatred,” associating her with negative stereotypes and using “hateful views” as a label.

**2. Repetition – Yes –** The poll question “Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?” is repeated three times in succession.

**3. Slogans – No –** There is no brief, memorable phrase used as a rallying slogan.

**4. Appeal to fear – Yes –** The mention of a “caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border” and the suggestion of using military force plays on fears of invasion or threat.

**5. Doubt – Yes –** The text questions the credibility and integrity of Ilhan Omar and the Democrat Party, e.g., “Neither the Democrat leadership nor the Democrat base cares that she married her brother.”

**6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes –** The claim that “her views are mainstream in the Democrat Party today” and “that’s all that matters to them” exaggerates the prevalence and motivation of these views.

**7. Flag-Waving – Yes –** The suggestion that military force should be used to protect the U.S. border appeals to patriotism.

**8. Loaded Language – Yes –** Phrases like “Islamic Jew-hatred,” “hateful views,” and “that’s all that matters to them” are emotionally charged and appeal to stereotypes.

**9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No –** There is no direct comparison to Nazis or other universally hated groups.

**10. Bandwagon – Yes –** The statement “her views are mainstream in the Democrat Party today” and “they want candidates like Ilhan Omar” suggests that these views are widely accepted and popular within the party.

**11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes –** The text implies that Omar’s religion and identity are the sole reasons for her selection and the party’s support, oversimplifying complex political processes.

**12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes –** The text makes broad claims about the Democrat Party and Omar’s motivations without providing specific evidence or clear definitions.

**13. Appeal to authority – Yes –** The text references “Official School Records Support Claims That Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) Married Her Brother,” and cites David Steinberg and PJ Media as sources.

**14. Black & white fallacy – Yes –** The poll presents only two options: use military force or not, with no nuance or alternative solutions.

**15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes –** The phrase “That’s all that matters to them” is used to shut down further discussion about the motivations of Democrats.

**16. Red herring – Yes –** The focus on Omar’s alleged marriage to her brother distracts from the main issues of her political views or policy positions.

**17. Straw men – Yes –** The text misrepresents the Democrat Party’s motivations and beliefs, suggesting they only care about “identity politics” and not other factors.

**18. Whataboutism – No –** There is no direct accusation of hypocrisy by comparing actions of opponents to others.

**Verdict – 95% –**  
The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques, including name-calling, loaded language, appeals to fear and patriotism, repetition, bandwagon, black & white fallacy, and more. It repeatedly uses emotionally charged and vague statements, presents oversimplified causalities, and misrepresents opposing views. The repeated poll question and the framing of issues in binary terms further reinforce the propagandistic nature. While not every single technique is present, the overwhelming use of multiple propaganda strategies makes it extremely likely that this text is propaganda, designed to persuade and manipulate the reader’s emotions and opinions rather than inform objectively.
