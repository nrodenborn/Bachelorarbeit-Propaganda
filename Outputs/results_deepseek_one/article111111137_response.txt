Here's the analysis of the Florida gun control article against the propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to the bill, its supporters, or opponents. Descriptions are factual (e.g., "expelled former student", "Republican-controlled House", "gun control activists").
2.  **Repetition** – No – Key points (the bill's provisions, the shooting, the vote) are mentioned contextually but not hammered repetitively without new information.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to promote a specific viewpoint (e.g., no "Ban Assault Weapons Now!" or "Protect the Second Amendment!").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the tragic shooting is described factually ("gunning down teachers and students"), the language describing the bill itself and its passage is neutral. It doesn't use the event explicitly to instill fear to push the bill or alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The credibility of individuals or institutions involved isn't questioned. Governor Scott's review is stated as a fact, not cast as doubt.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Descriptions of the event, the bill's provisions, and reactions seem factual and proportional. Words like "worst school shootings" are contextual.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty (e.g., "True Americans support...", "Defend our freedoms") are made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – *Potential Minor Use* – The phrase "gunning down teachers and students" is graphic and evokes emotion. However, it's a factual description of the event. Overall, the article leans heavily factual, but this phrase has emotional weight. *(Weakest potential match)*
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or universally despised groups are made to criticize the bill or its supporters/opponents.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – While it mentions Florida joining other states allowing armed school personnel ("Florida now joins at least six other states..."), this is presented as factual information, not as a reason to support the policy ("Everyone else is doing it!").
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The article reports the shooting as the catalyst for the bill but doesn't simplistically claim the bill alone will solve school shootings or attribute the shooting solely to one cause like age limits.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The bill's provisions are listed clearly and specifically (age limit, waiting period, guardian program rules, bump stock ban, mental health funding).
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Quotes from figures (Petty, legislators) are used to report reactions, not as evidence proving the bill's merit. Governor Scott's review process is stated, not used as endorsement.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The article presents complexities: the bill passed but excludes an assault weapons ban desired by victims' families; Democrats support it despite concerns about the guardian program; Governor Scott has previously opposed key elements. No false dilemma is presented.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used to shut down discussion (e.g., "It's common sense", "The debate is over").
16. **Red herring** – No – The mention of the Alabama shooting is brief and contextual ("On the day the vote passed..."), related to school gun violence, not introduced to distract from the Florida bill debate.
17. **Straw men** – No – The article accurately reports positions: the bill's contents, victim families' demands (assault weapon ban not included), Democratic support with reservations, Governor Scott's past positions. No misrepresentations are constructed to attack.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are leveled. Governor Scott's past opposition is stated factually, not used to accuse him of inconsistency or hypocrisy regarding his review.

**Verdict – 15% –** The article is overwhelmingly a factual news report. It clearly outlines the provisions of the gun control bill, the context of the Parkland shooting, the legislative process (votes, debate), reactions from various stakeholders (victim's parent, legislators), and the next steps. The language is primarily neutral and informative. The *only* element with potential emotional weight is the factual description "gunning down teachers and students," which could be seen as mildly loaded language. However, this is a direct description of a tragic event central to the story and doesn't significantly shift the piece towards propaganda. There is no discernible attempt to systematically manipulate emotions, distort facts, discredit opponents unfairly, or oversimplify the issue to push a specific agenda beyond reporting the developments. The article presents multiple perspectives and complexities surrounding the bill.
