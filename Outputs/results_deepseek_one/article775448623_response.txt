Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text "3-D-printed guns put carnage a click away" for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes –** Uses the negatively charged term "ghost guns" to label the 3D-printed firearms. ("Plans by a Texas organization to publish... downloadable blueprints for 3-D-printed plastic firearms — so-called ghost guns...")
2.  **Repetition – No –** While dangers are emphasized, there is no significant repetition of the exact same phrase or slogan throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans – No –** The text does not employ any brief, memorable catchphrases like "Build the Wall." The title "carnage a click away" is evocative but functions more as loaded language than a standalone slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes –** Heavily emphasizes the dangers and negative consequences (carnage, no background checks, terrorists getting guns, undetectable weapons, loss of innocent lives) to instill fear and support the argument against releasing the blueprints. ("No background check would weed out felons...", "...getting an AR-15-style rifle is just a matter of a few computer clicks", "...will lead directly to the loss of more innocent lives.")
5.  **Doubt – Yes –** Questions the Trump administration's decision-making process and motives. ("Credit for this dangerous scenario... goes to the Trump administration for its inexplicable decision...", "The Brady Center... has filed a Freedom of Information Act request to find out how this senseless decision was reached, and whether groups such as the National Rifle Association were involved.")
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes –** Uses dramatic language like "carnage a click away" and "dangerous scenario" to heighten the perceived threat. Minimizes the complexity of the legal settlement by portraying it purely as "worship at the altar of gun rights" and "foolhardy". ("3-D-printed guns put carnage a click away", "Credit for this dangerous scenario...", "...this administration’s worship at the altar of gun rights", "...this foolhardy move".)
7.  **Flag-Waving – No –** The text does not appeal to patriotism, national identity, or a specific group identity like "We the People" to rally support.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes –** Employs emotionally charged words and phrases with strong negative connotations: "carnage," "alarmed," "dangerous scenario," "inexplicable decision," "stunning," "worship at the altar," "senseless decision," "troubling," "dangerous," "terrorists," "gunmen," "loss of more innocent lives," "foolhardy move." (Throughout the text, e.g., "carnage a click away", "dangerous scenario", "senseless decision", "loss of more innocent lives".)
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No –** The text does not attempt to disapprove of an idea by associating it with Nazis, the Vichy regime, or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon – No –** While it mentions that gun safety groups and law enforcement are alarmed, it does not explicitly argue that the reader should oppose the settlement *because* it's popular to do so or that "everyone" is doing it. The appeal is based on the perceived danger, not popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – No –** The text attributes the *scenario* (easy access to untraceable guns) to the settlement, but it acknowledges existing problems ("Ghost guns are already a problem") and doesn't claim the settlement is the *sole* or *simple* cause of all related future harms. It presents a chain of likely consequences, not an oversimplified single cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No –** The text is clear and direct about its points, concerns, and the events described. It does not use deliberately unclear language to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes –** Cites the alarm of "leading gun safety groups and law enforcement officials," mentions the Brady Center's actions, and quotes Senator Menendez to bolster the argument. ("...have rightly alarmed leading gun safety groups and law enforcement officials.", "The Brady Center... has filed...", "“Why on earth would the Trump administration make it easier for terrorists and gunmen to produce undetectable plastic guns?” asked Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.).")
14. **Black & white fallacy – No –** The text does not present only two extreme choices. It acknowledges the existing problem of ghost guns and proposes specific actions ("The administration should stop...", "Congress should act..."), but doesn't frame the overall issue as a simple binary choice with no other options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No –** The text does not employ phrases designed to shut down critical thinking. It presents arguments and encourages specific actions based on reasoning.
16. **Red herring – No –** The text stays focused on the issue of 3D-printed guns, the settlement, and its perceived dangers. It does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract from this core argument.
17. **Straw men – No –** The text does not misrepresent the opposing argument (e.g., the stance of Defense Distributed or the administration's rationale for settling). It criticizes the decision and its perceived effects but doesn't attack a distorted version of the pro-settlement position.
18. **Whataboutism – No –** The text does not charge its opponents (the Trump administration, Defense Distributed) with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions on unrelated issues. It focuses criticism directly on the settlement and its consequences.

**Verdict – 40% –** The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, primarily **Loaded Language**, **Appeal to Fear**, **Name Calling**, **Doubt**, and **Appeal to Authority**. These techniques are used to strongly persuade the reader against the settlement allowing the publication of 3D-printed gun blueprints. However, it is not *purely* propaganda. It reports on factual events (the lawsuit, the settlement, the reactions of specific groups/officials, the planned publication date) and cites specific sources (Senator Menendez). The core arguments, while presented emotionally, are based on logical concerns about accessibility, traceability, and detectability of firearms. The combination of factual reporting with heavy use of persuasive techniques places it in the realm of strong advocacy or opinion journalism rather than pure propaganda, hence the moderate likelihood percentage.
