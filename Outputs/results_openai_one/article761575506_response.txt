Verdict – 20% – The text contains some elements of propaganda, particularly in the form of repetition and minimization. Clinton's repeated emphasis on his public apology could be seen as an attempt to reinforce a particular narrative. However, the text largely reports on an interview and provides context without overtly employing multiple propaganda techniques. Therefore, the likelihood of the text being propaganda is relatively low.
