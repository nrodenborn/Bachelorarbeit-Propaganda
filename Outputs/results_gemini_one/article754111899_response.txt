1. Name calling – No – The text uses medical and geographical terms, not insulting labels, to describe the situation, the disease, and the people involved.
2. Repetition – No – The text presents a sequence of facts and historical context without repeating a specific message for persuasive effect.
3. Slogans – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to rally support or promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – No – While the subject matter (a "severe, often fatal illness") is inherently frightening, the text reports facts about the disease's nature rather than using fear to promote a specific idea against an alternative.
5. Doubt – No – The text cites official sources like the health ministry and the WHO without questioning their credibility.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text provides specific numbers of cases and deaths as reported by health officials, without appearing to either exaggerate or downplay the situation.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions several nations but does not make any appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – No – The language is clinical and factual (e.g., "hemorrhagic fever," "human-to-human transmission"). It avoids emotionally charged words intended to manipulate the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to hated groups like the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is correct or should be adopted because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text explains the complex transmission process of the virus, from animals to humans and between humans, which is a scientific explanation, not an oversimplification.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is clear and specific, providing names, locations, and statistics.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses information from authorities as evidence. Example: "Two cases of Ebola have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according to a government health official." and "The World Health Organisation reports that the first Ebola outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa".
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text describes a situation and does not present it as a choice between only two options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text is informational and does not use phrases that discourage critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – All information presented is directly relevant to the Ebola outbreak.
17. Straw men – No – The text is a report, not an argument; it does not refute any positions.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any party of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 0% – The text is a factual news report, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the public about a health event, not to persuade or manipulate opinion. While it technically uses "Appeal to authority," it does so by citing credible sources (the WHO, government health officials) to establish facts, which is a fundamental practice of responsible journalism. The complete absence of manipulative techniques such as loaded language, name-calling, fear-mongering, or fallacious reasoning confirms its nature as an objective and informational piece.
