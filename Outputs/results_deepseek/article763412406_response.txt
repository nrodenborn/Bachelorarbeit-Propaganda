### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs **12 of 18 techniques** (e.g., name-calling, fear appeals, loaded language) to emotionally manipulate readers and advance a one-sided political agenda. Key indicators include:  
- **Dehumanizing rhetoric**: Labels Islam a "cult" and accuses the government of "betrayal."  
- **Fear-driven narrative**: Graphic depictions of child rape, terrorism, and cultural erosion to provoke outrage.  
- **Us-vs-Them framing**: Portrays Muslims as inherent threats to British values and Tommy Robinson as a martyr for "free speech."  
- **Selective focus**: Omits context about Robinson’s legal case (e.g., contempt of court violations) and complex socio-political factors.  
- **Emotional over rational appeal**: Relies on repetitive, hyperbolic questions ("Why?") rather than evidence-based analysis.  

The article’s structure—quoting incendiary speeches, amplifying unverified claims, and concluding with a call to religious nationalism ("return to the God of their forefathers")—confirms its intent to radicalize, not inform. While it reports a real event, the framing, language, and omission of counter-perspectives make it 95% likely to be propaganda.
