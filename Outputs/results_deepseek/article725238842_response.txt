Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used (e.g., "criminal" or derogatory terms). The subject is neutrally referred to as a "Mexican national," "legal permanent resident alien male," or "subject."  
2. **Repetition** – No – The core message is stated once without repetition.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used (e.g., "Secure our borders!" is absent).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text reports facts without invoking fear of alternatives (e.g., no suggestion that lax policies caused this).  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility (e.g., no undermining of institutions or individuals).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Descriptions are factual: "trace amounts of marijuana" minimizes nothing, and events are reported proportionally.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or identity (e.g., no mention of "protecting America").  
8. **Loaded Language** – No – Neutral terms like "arrested," "seized," and "subject" lack emotional/stereotypical weight.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No associations with hated groups (e.g., no comparisons to Nazis or cartels).  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., no claims like "Americans demand action").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No simplistic causes are assigned (e.g., no blaming border policies for the incident).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are specific: location (Port of Nogales), items (9MM handgun), and outcomes (stolen truck turned over to task force).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Actions by authorities (officers, ICE) are reported factually, not used as evidence to support a broader claim.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Only this incident is described; no false dilemmas (e.g., "either secure borders or chaos") are presented.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases that halt discussion (e.g., "case closed" or "end of story").  
16. **Red herring** – No – All details (stolen truck, drugs, weapon) are directly relevant to the arrest.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented arguments are refuted; the text solely reports events.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no deflection like "What about previous administrations?").  

**Verdict – 0%** – The text is a straightforward news report detailing a specific law enforcement incident. It uses neutral, factual language without persuasive intent, emotional manipulation, or omission of relevant context. All information presented (e.g., the subject’s status, seized items, procedures followed) serves an informative purpose, aligning with standard journalistic reporting. No propaganda techniques are employed to influence the audience’s perception beyond relaying objective events.
