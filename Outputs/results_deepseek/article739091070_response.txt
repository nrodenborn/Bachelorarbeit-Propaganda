3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "rapists and child sex offenders escaping arrest" instills fear about dangers of not enforcing raids.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Schaaf refuses to say how she learned" questions her credibility.

13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authoritative figures cited as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Implies businesses must either arrest "criminals" or be complicit in felony (no middle ground).

16. **Red herring** – Yes – "Obama holdovers" distracts from the mayor’s actions with irrelevant political blame.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Claims mayor was "tipping off criminals" (refuting an unstated argument that protecting immigrants is acceptable).

---

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs 12/18 analyzed techniques, including inflammatory labels (*Name Calling*), fearmongering (*Appeal to Fear*), oversimplification of cause/effect (*Causal Oversimplification*), and false dichotomies (*Black & White Fallacy*). Language is deliberately loaded to dehumanize immigrants ("*illegal alien criminals*") and vilify the mayor, while factual claims (e.g., businesses "committing a crime") lack context about actual legal standards for harboring. The narrative distorts events into a moral panic, using emotional triggers over balanced reporting. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the text’s basis in real events (emails, mayor’s warning), but its framing is manipulative and ideologically driven.
