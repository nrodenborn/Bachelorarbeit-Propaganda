Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **No** – The text describes Guyger's actions ("adverse conduct", "killing", "shot him dead") but does not use insulting labels directed *at her* beyond reporting facts of the case and official terminology.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively. This repetition serves no narrative purpose within the Guyger story.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases are used to encapsulate the message about Guyger's firing.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – The text reports outrage and calls for justice but does not attempt to instill fear against alternatives to firing Guyger.
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – The text does not question the credibility of specific individuals or entities regarding the core event (Guyger's actions and firing). It questions Chief Hall's *earlier justification* but presents it as resolved by the firing.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – The description of Guyger's actions ("walked into an innocent man’s home and shot him dead," "this man no longer lives") is stark but factual based on the admitted events. Her firing is presented as significant but not exaggerated or minimized.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No appeal to patriotism or national/group identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Phrases like "outrage erupted, and rightfully so," "utterly preposterous," and "public servant" (used sarcastically in context: "This public servant walked into an innocent man’s home and shot him dead.") appeal to emotion and judgment. "Standing up against" implies the department was resisting just demands.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No association with universally hated groups is made to disapprove of an idea.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – While reporting public outrage and activist calls, the text doesn't explicitly use popularity as the *reason* Guyger should have been fired or the firing was correct. It reports reactions *to* the firing.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The text presents Guyger's firing as a result of an internal affairs investigation concluding "adverse conduct" related to her arrest for manslaughter. It doesn't oversimplify the complex legal and procedural factors involved.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text reports events and statements clearly. The term "adverse conduct" is official terminology quoted from the department's statement.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text cites NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch's response ("Good") specifically to show support for the firing: "showing her support for the move." It uses her status/affiliation to bolster the positive view of the firing.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – The text doesn't present the situation as having only two possible choices or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases are used to shut down critical thought about Guyger's actions or the firing.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The entire poll section ("take our poll...Email *...Privacy Policy...") is completely irrelevant to the story of Amber Guyger's firing. It serves only to distract and potentially capture reader data.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text doesn't misrepresent or refute an argument that wasn't actually made regarding Guyger's firing.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – The text introduces the unrelated case in Maryland ("a father in Prince George’s County opened fire on officers... Not only was he not arrested, but the police chief praised him and apologized.") This diverts attention from the Guyger case by charging the police/handling of that case with hypocrisy or inconsistency.

**Verdict – 35% –** The core report on Amber Guyger's firing is factual, reporting official statements, reactions, and background. However, the text employs several propaganda techniques. The **Red Herring** poll is a blatant, irrelevant distraction. **Loaded Language** ("rightfully so," "utterly preposterous," sarcastic "public servant") injects strong emotional judgment. **Appeal to Authority** is used by citing Dana Loesch's approval. **Whataboutism** diverts attention with the unrelated Maryland case. While the main story has a basis in fact, these techniques, particularly the poll and the loaded phrasing, push the presentation towards propaganda by manipulating reader focus, emotion, and perception beyond straightforward reporting. The percentage reflects that while propaganda elements are present and significant, they do not completely overwhelm the factual reporting of the event itself.
