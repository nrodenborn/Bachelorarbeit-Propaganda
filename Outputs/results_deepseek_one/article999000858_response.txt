### Verdict – 70% –  
**Explanation**:  
The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques (e.g., **Name Calling**, **Loaded Language**, **Red Herring**, **Black & White Fallacy**), primarily through Kemp’s rebuttals and the article’s framing. The inclusion of an irrelevant poll (Red Herring) and emotionally charged terms like "temper tantrum" (Loaded Language) suggest an intent to sway readers against Abrams. However, it also reports factual elements (e.g., vote counts, legal procedures) and quotes both sides, reducing overt bias. The source (Breitbart) and selective emphasis on Kemp’s narrative amplify propagandistic elements, but the presence of verifiable details prevents a higher likelihood. Thus, the text leans toward propaganda but retains some journalistic structure.
