Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Trump referring to the Russia investigation as a "Russian Witch Hunt Hoax," which is an insulting label used to attack the investigation.
2.  Repetition – Yes – The text first summarizes Trump's position and then repeats it by directly quoting his tweet, reinforcing the message: "The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself."
3.  Slogans – Yes – The phrase "Russian Witch Hunt Hoax" is used as a brief, memorable slogan to frame the investigation negatively.
4.  Appeal to fear – No – The text does not support an idea by instilling fear against other alternatives.
5.  Doubt – Yes – The entire text is centered on Trump questioning the credibility and loyalty of Jeff Sessions's decision to recuse himself.
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The statement "so many lives ruined" is an exaggeration of the investigation's impact. The definitive claim of "No Collusion" can be seen as a minimization of the investigation's complexities and findings.
7.  Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism.
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "Witch Hunt," "Hoax," and "ruined" to appeal to emotion and create a strong negative impression.
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea to a group hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text quotes Trump blaming the entire continuation of the investigation on a single cause: "all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The message in the text is direct and not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does not use an external authority's support as evidence for a claim.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present only two options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "No Collusion!" is presented as a simple, definitive fact intended to end any debate or critical thought on the subject.
16. Red herring – No – The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main point.
17. Straw men – No – The text attacks the actual investigation and the actions of Jeff Sessions, not a misrepresentation of an argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge an opponent with hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 90% – The text itself is a news report, but it is reporting on statements from Donald Trump that are heavily saturated with propaganda techniques. The core of the article is the direct quotation of these statements. Multiple techniques are employed simultaneously, such as Name Calling ("Witch Hunt Hoax"), Loaded Language ("ruined"), Causal Oversimplification (blaming Sessions for the entire probe), and Thought-Terminating Clichés ("No Collusion!"). The purpose of these quoted statements is not to present a reasoned argument but to shape public perception by discrediting the investigation, shifting blame, and creating a simple, emotionally charged narrative. Because the text's primary function is to convey these propagandistic messages to the reader, it serves as a vehicle for propaganda.
