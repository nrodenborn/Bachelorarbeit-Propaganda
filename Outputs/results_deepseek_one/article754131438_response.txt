Here is the analysis of the text against the listed propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against any subject.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message ("Ebola outbreak declared") is stated clearly but not excessively repeated beyond standard reporting.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to rally support or emotion (e.g., "Build the Wall").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the disease is described as "deadly" and the fatality rate (50%) is mentioned, this is presented clinically as factual information from health authorities, not to instill fear against alternatives or push a specific agenda. The focus is on the response measures.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The credibility of any entity (DRC government, WHO) is not questioned.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The information presented (cases, deaths, fatality rate, response measures) appears factual and proportional, without obvious overstatement or understatement.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There are no appeals to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – Language is generally neutral and descriptive ("deadly disease," "rare," "confirmed," "suspected," "necessary measures"). Terms like "outrage" or inflammatory adjectives are absent.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally despised groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea to encourage acceptance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The transmission of the virus ("from wild animals," "human-to-human") is explained without implying a single simple cause for the outbreak itself.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The language is clear and specific (location: Bikoro; cases: 2 confirmed, 21 suspected; deaths: 17; response measures outlined).
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While WHO and the DRC Ministry of Health are cited, their statements are reported as factual sources of information about the outbreak and response, not used as evidence to support a debatable claim or opinion.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No situation is presented with only two extreme options; the reporting is nuanced.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking or discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the outbreak details and response; no irrelevant topics are introduced.
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented or weaker arguments are set up to be refuted.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy are made against any individual or group.

**Verdict – 0% –** The text is a straightforward, factual news report about the declaration of an Ebola outbreak in the DRC. It presents information sourced from official bodies (DRC government, WHO) including laboratory confirmations, case numbers, fatality rates, transmission methods, and planned response measures. The language is neutral, descriptive, and avoids emotional manipulation, appeals to identity, attacks on opponents, oversimplification, logical fallacies, or any of the other listed propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is to inform the public about a public health event, not to persuade, promote a specific agenda, or discredit an opposing view. There is no discernible propagandistic intent or technique employed.
