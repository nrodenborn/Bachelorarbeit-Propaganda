1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack individuals, for example, calling Peter Strzok and Lisa Page “immoral FBI philanderers” and Anthony Weiner a “disgraced former Congressman.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is repeated three times in a row to reinforce the idea.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use or promote a brief, memorable phrase to encapsulate an idea.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear about the trustworthiness of a key government institution with questions like, “How in the world can we trust them even as they express bias while investigating malfeasance?”

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is designed to cast doubt on the credibility of the FBI and its investigation, stating, “Under these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation... was free from bias.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to frame the situation as more extreme than it might be, for example, by calling the situation “INSANE” and referring to Peter Strzok as “the big bad guy in the FBI mess.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text makes a subtle appeal to patriotism by framing the issue as one that harms the country's institutions in the eyes of its citizens: “Horowitz blames Comey, Strzok, and Page for besmirching the good name of the FBI and harming the agencies reputation with the American people.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as “Rips,” “lambaste,” “terrible judgment,” “immoral,” “besmirching,” and “damned.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular or that the reader should join a majority.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies a complex investigation by suggesting one person’s bias is the primary cause for the outcome: “It really does seem that Strzok, an agent who had a personal pro-Hillary bias, was the person who pushed to let her off the hook.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague; on the contrary, it makes very direct and pointed accusations, even if they are biased interpretations.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly cites the “Inspector General Michael Horowitz’ report” as well as The Washington Post and Fox News to lend credibility to its arguments.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between the FBI being completely honorable or being completely corrupt and politically biased, downplaying the report’s more nuanced conclusion of serious mistakes without provable political motivation.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to discourage critical thought.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll, “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?”, which is irrelevant to the details of the IG report and serves to distract the reader and reinforce a separate political narrative.

17. Straw men – No – The text does not refute an argument that was not presented; it directly engages with the findings of the IG report and the reported defenses of the individuals involved.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect a charge of hypocrisy by pointing to the actions of an opponent; it is making the initial accusations of bias and misconduct.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. While it is structured around an official government document (the IG report), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader of a specific, highly partisan viewpoint. It achieves this by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques, including loaded language (“lambaste,” “immoral philanderers”), name-calling, exaggeration (“This is INSANE”), and causal oversimplification (blaming the entire outcome on one agent’s bias). It heavily relies on an appeal to authority (the IG report) but selectively interprets the findings to cast maximum doubt on the FBI, while downplaying the report's conclusion that political bias could not be proven. The inclusion of a repetitive and distracting red herring poll further demonstrates its intent to manipulate opinion rather than present objective analysis.
