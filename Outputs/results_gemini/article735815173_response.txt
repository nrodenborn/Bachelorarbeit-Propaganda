1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Louis Farrakhan a “notorious anti-Semite” and the Nation of Islam a “hate group”.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly mentions Louis Farrakhan’s specific anti-Semitic comments, such as praising Hitler and denouncing Jews, to reinforce the message of his extremism.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in a slogan-like manner.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text repeatedly quotes Farrakhan’s extreme statements, such as “white people ‘deserve to die’” and his praise for Hitler, to instill fear and alarm about his ideology and influence.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text explicitly questions the credibility of the ADL and the JTA, accusing them of an “awkward attempt to whitewash” the story and stating “the ADL is wrong”.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by describing the media's lack of coverage as a “tight embargo.” It also highlights Rep. Davis's own use of minimization when he dismisses Farrakhan's anti-Semitism as just “one segment of what goes on in our world.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to identity politics by creating a contrast between how a “white congressman” would be treated versus how “black leaders have gotten away with” associating with figures like Farrakhan.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases such as “hate group,” “notorious anti-Semite,” “whitewash,” and the historically charged term “the Jewish question” to evoke strong emotional responses.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text explicitly states that Farrakhan praised “Adolf Hitler as a ‘very great man’” to discredit him and, by association, Rep. Davis. It also makes a similar comparison using the figure of David Duke.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular; in fact, it argues the opposite by claiming the media is ignoring the story.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the media's lack of coverage as a “tight embargo” and the ADL/JTA's actions as a simple desire to “whitewash” the issue, ignoring other potential complex factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and point of view; it does not use vague or obscure language to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text relies on the authority of its own sources, “TheDC” and “The Daily Caller News Foundation,” presenting their interviews and reporting as the factual basis for its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a binary choice: either one completely denounces Farrakhan, or one is enabling anti-Semitism. It also suggests the ADL and JTA have only two options: “whitewash this” or “ignore it.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text is argumentative and aims to provoke a specific conclusion rather than using clichés to shut down discussion.
16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on the central issue of Rep. Davis, Louis Farrakhan, and the reaction of other groups. The analogies used serve to reinforce the main argument, not distract from it.
17. Straw men – No – The text directly addresses and refutes claims it attributes to the ADL and Rep. Davis, rather than misrepresenting their arguments to make them easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges the political and media establishment with hypocrisy by posing a hypothetical: “Somehow I don't think a white congressman would get away with saying that he agrees with David Duke... But black leaders have gotten away with playing that game with Farrakhan repeatedly.”

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it reports on a real event and includes direct quotes, its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader towards a specific, highly negative viewpoint. It achieves this by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques. The language is heavily loaded with emotional and accusatory terms ("hate group," "whitewash"). It consistently uses name-calling to frame the subjects and repetition to drill in the most damaging information about Farrakhan. The piece creates a simple, black-and-white narrative where Rep. Davis is complicit, and institutions like the media and the ADL are engaged in a cover-up, a claim bolstered by casting doubt on their motives and simplifying their actions. The author's goal is to generate outrage and confirm a particular political narrative, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
