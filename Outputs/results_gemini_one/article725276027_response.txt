1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the term “Kritarch” to refer to Judges Patti Saris and Mark Goldsmith, an insulting neologism implying they are tyrants who rule by fiat. It also refers to a lawyer as a “Treason Bar attorney.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The insulting label “Kritarch” is used repeatedly to describe both judges throughout the text (e.g., "Kritarch Patti Saris," "minor kritarchs," "And Kritarch Saris has not stopped," "Kritarch Mark Goldsmith").
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the hashtag “#Resistance” to label the judges' actions as part of a broader, illegitimate political movement.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by stating a judge is ordering the release of "hundreds of Iraqi illegal aliens and criminal aliens" into the community.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire text is an exercise in casting doubt on the authority and motives of federal judges, for example: "Saris like many other Federal judges does not like our current immigration system and wants another system more to her liking."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the judges' intentions, claiming they want an "unlimited number of hearings" and a "whole new second immigration appeals system of unlimited delay."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a defense of the "lawful immigration policies of President Trump" and the need for Congress to act to protect the nation's laws.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged terms like “illegal aliens,” “absconding,” “Treason Bar attorney,” and “little amnesty” to create a negative impression of the immigrants and the judges.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is good because it is popular; rather, it argues against what it portrays as a dangerous trend among judges.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the judges' complex legal rulings by claiming they are based on personal feelings rather than legal interpretation: "Kritarch Saris thinks that her feelings about a deportation are the same as the law."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses the undefined term "Kritarch" to label the judges without explaining its meaning, relying on its negative sound to confuse and persuade the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the U.S. Justice Department and "Federal law" as the ultimate authorities to support its argument that the judges are wrong: “Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a simple choice between the "lawful immigration policies of President Trump" and the "illegal and unconstitutional #Resistance" of the judges, ignoring any legal nuance.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses dismissive phrases to shut down consideration of the judges' reasoning, such as: "Well, that is not Kritarch Saris' concern."
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the case of Judge Mark Goldsmith and Iraqi immigrants, which is a separate case, to distract from the specifics of the Saris case and create a narrative of a widespread conspiracy by "kritarchs."
17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the judge's position by claiming "Kritarch Saris thinks that her feelings about a deportation are the same as the law," refuting a simplistic emotional motive rather than engaging with her actual legal reasoning.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any of its targets of hypocrisy by pointing to their own past actions.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. It employs an overwhelming number of propaganda techniques (16 out of the 18 listed) to advance its position. The piece is not a reasoned legal or political analysis but a polemic designed to provoke an emotional reaction and persuade the reader through manipulation. It consistently uses name-calling ("Kritarch," "Treason Bar"), loaded language ("illegal aliens"), appeals to fear ("criminal aliens"), and straw man arguments (claiming judges rule by "feelings"). The argument is built on a black-and-white fallacy that pits the President's "lawful" policies against the judges' "illegal" resistance, simplifying a complex legal issue into a battle of good versus evil. The sheer density and variety of these techniques demonstrate a clear intent to propagandize rather than inform.
