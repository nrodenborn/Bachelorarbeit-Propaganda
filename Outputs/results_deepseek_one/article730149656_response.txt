Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "anti-Semite Pastor Steve Anderson," "bigoted and radical agenda," "obscene travesty." The text uses insulting labels to attack Anderson and Zakkout.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – No specific phrase or message is repeated consistently throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as slogans within the text itself (though it quotes others' slogans like "We are Hamas").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "Sofian Zakkout’s bigoted and radical agenda is antithetical to this and is a documented threat to national security." This links Zakkout's presence on the boards to a threat against national security, instilling fear to support the call for his removal.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "why would groups committed to fighting crime continue to compromise themselves and sabotage their mission by affiliating with him?" and "One would think that they would find Zakkout’s actions and bigotry unacceptable, as well, yet Zakkout continues to serve unchallenged." These statements question the credibility and judgment of the anti-crime groups for not removing Zakkout.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Calling Zakkout's agenda a "documented threat to national security" is a strong claim presented without specific evidence within the text, likely an exaggeration. Minimization isn't prominent.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "maintain their credibility and remain true to their stated missions of protecting and safeguarding the American public." Appeals to patriotism and the duty to protect America.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Words and phrases like "venomous," "hate and intolerance," "disturbing," "bigotry," "radical," "antithetical," "documented threat," "obscene travesty," "repudiate" are used heavily to evoke strong negative emotions against Zakkout and his associates.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – The text extensively associates Zakkout with figures and groups universally reviled in the West (David Duke - former KKK leader, Louis Farrakhan - NOI leader known for anti-Semitism, Hamas - designated terrorist group, Holocaust denial) to condemn him and his views. "The report calls the Holocaust 'the biggest lie ever foisted upon humanity' and was produced by a media outlet which describes Hitler as 'the greatest leader in modern Western history.'" This explicitly links Zakkout's shared content to Holocaust denial and Hitler glorification.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text doesn't argue that removing Zakkout is popular; it argues it's the *right* thing to do based on his associations and views.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – "If the board members... do not wish to be associated with anti-Semitism or white supremacism or Hamas or Holocaust denial or Steve Anderson or David Duke or Louis Farrakhan, then they must cut ties with Sofian Zakkout." It simplifies the groups' compromised credibility and mission sabotage *solely* down to their association with Zakkout, ignoring other potential factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and specific about Zakkout's actions, associations, and statements. It does not rely on vague or confusing language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemning both Anderson and Zakkout, and describes their video as "venomous." Also cites Beila Rabinowitz, Director of Militant Islam Monitor, as a contributor, lending her authority to the report.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the choice for the anti-crime boards as binary: either cut ties with Zakkout or be associated with (and thus implicitly endorse) anti-Semitism, white supremacism, Hamas, Holocaust denial, etc. "If... they do not wish to be associated with... then they must cut ties..."
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases are used to shut down critical thinking (e.g., "it is what it is," "that's just common sense"). The text encourages critical thought *against* Zakkout.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The focus remains on Zakkout's statements, associations, and suitability for the anti-crime boards. Information about Anderson, Duke, Farrakhan, and Hamas is directly relevant to establishing Zakkout's views and associations.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks Zakkout's actual documented statements (e.g., Holocaust denial, praising Duke, sharing Anderson/Farrakhan, supporting Hamas) and associations. It doesn't misrepresent his position.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not defend Zakkout or others by accusing critics of hypocrisy on unrelated issues. It focuses solely on Zakkout's actions.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to neutrally inform but to aggressively persuade the audience that Sofian Zakkout is a dangerous bigot whose presence on anti-crime boards is unacceptable and a threat, demanding his immediate removal. This is achieved through:
1.  **Heavy Use of Negative Persuasion Techniques:** Reliance on Name Calling, Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear, Reduction ad Hitlerum (guilt by association with reviled figures/groups), and Doubt (casting aspersions on the boards for not acting) dominate the text.
2.  **Clear Agenda & Call to Action:** The text explicitly states its demand: "they must cut ties with Sofian Zakkout," "these groups need to divorce themselves from Zakkout and repudiate what he stands for."
3.  **Selective Presentation:** While the facts presented about Zakkout's associations and statements may be true, they are curated and presented in the most damning light possible, emphasizing emotional impact (fear, outrage, disgust) over balanced context or Zakkout's perspective. His role on the anti-crime boards is used primarily as leverage to attack him.
4.  **Lack of Neutrality:** The language is consistently inflammatory and judgmental ("obscene travesty," "venomous," "bigoted and radical agenda," "documented threat"). The text frames the issue starkly as good (the missions of the anti-crime groups, safeguarding America) vs. evil (Zakkout and his associations).
5.  **Appeal to Authority:** Uses the ADL and the Militant Islam Monitor director to bolster its claims.
The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the possibility that the *facts* cited might be accurate, but the *presentation*, *tone*, *selectivity*, and *dominant techniques* used make the text's purpose clear: it is persuasive propaganda aimed at discrediting Zakkout and pressuring his removal.
