1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels George Soros a “Globalist billionaire,” using “globalist” as a pejorative term to attack him.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?” is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as standalone slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by describing the migrants as a threat that needs to be thwarted by “riot gear,” “barbed wire,” “razor wire,” “5,200 troops,” and military hardware like “drones, helicopters with night-vision capabilities.” It also uses phrases like “rush” the border and “impending migrant ‘invasion.’”
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the migrants’ motives by stating they are coming “under the guise of seeking asylum” and that their claims are “ineligible.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the threat by quoting President Trump’s description of the caravan as an “impending migrant ‘invasion.’”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the situation as a threat to the “U.S. southern border” that requires a response from the U.S. military, including “@DeptofDefense,” “National Guardsmen,” and “Operation Faithful Patriot.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “Globalist billionaire,” “rush the border,” and “invasion” to create a negative impression of the migrants and their supporters.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with hated groups like Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not attempt to persuade the reader by claiming an idea is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The headline “Soros-Funded Lawyers Helping Caravan Migrants Get Asylum” simplifies the complex issue of migration into a single cause: the actions of a billionaire.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague sourcing like “There are reports that they plan to ‘rush’ the border” without specifying the source of these reports, creating uncertainty and suspicion.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites authorities like “Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen,” “Breitbart,” and “the New York Times” to lend credibility to its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between defending the U.S. from an “invasion” or allowing entry to migrants with “ineligible asylum claims,” ignoring more nuanced policy options or perspectives.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll about CNN reporter Jim Acosta (“Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?”), which is completely irrelevant to the topic of the migrant caravan, to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text creates a straw man by broadly declaring that seeking to get away from crime or looking for a job are “ineligible asylum claims,” then states the caravan “mostly consists” of such people. This oversimplifies and misrepresents the legal arguments for asylum that the lawyers and migrants might actually be making.
1- Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a vast number of propaganda techniques (13 out of the 18 listed) to construct a one-sided and emotionally manipulative narrative. The article's primary goal is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of the migrants, their legal helpers, and George Soros.

The piece frames the complex issue of migration as a sinister plot (Causal Oversimplification) orchestrated by a "Globalist billionaire" (Name Calling, Loaded Language). It heavily relies on an Appeal to Fear, using militaristic language ("invasion," "riot gear," "troops," "thwart") to portray the migrants as a dangerous, hostile force. It actively sows Doubt about the migrants' intentions ("under the guise of asylum") and uses a Straw Man argument to preemptively dismiss their legal claims as "ineligible."

Furthermore, the article uses Appeals to Authority selectively to bolster its viewpoint and introduces a completely irrelevant Red Herring (the Jim Acosta poll) to distract the reader. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to shape opinion through emotional manipulation and logical fallacies rather than objective reporting.
