1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels for opponents, such as calling Chris Bryant an "über-left pol" and referring to those who might threaten violence as "savages".

2. Repetition – Yes – The core idea that banning the author and others is a victory for Sharia law and a defeat for freedom is repeated in various forms throughout the text. For example, "It was the victory of Islamic law over Western law, sharia over freedom" and "The worldwide howl at Trump’s retweets... is further proof of the Islamization of the West."

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as a rallying cry.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns of a dire future, suggesting that these bans will lead to "national suicide" and that failure to oppose these actions means being unsafe ("Safe by surrender? When did they ever work in the history of humankind?").

5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and motives of the media and political figures. Example: "Once again the media are blaming the messenger instead of dealing with Islamic violence."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of the ban by calling it "one of that once great nation’s darkest moments". It also minimizes the controversial nature of the retweeted videos by stating, "They’re neither 'far-right' nor 'Islamophobic'; they’re just factual."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by mentioning the plan to bring "the Stars and Stripes, as well as British and Danish flags" and by reminding the British that America is "the nation that saved their nation from extinction not 70 years ago."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as "madness," "savages," "persecution," "totalitarian," and "national suicide."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare an idea to one popular with Nazis or other groups hated by the audience. While it uses the word "fascism," it is redefining the opponent's use of the term rather than making the comparison itself.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea; instead, it frames the author and her allies as a persecuted minority fighting against a majority opinion.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue. Example: "The worldwide howl at Trump’s retweets of videos tweeted out by a British politician is further proof of the Islamization of the West."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and aggressive in its language and does not use intentionally unclear expressions.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author presents herself as an authority and directs the reader to her own book for the complete story. Example: "The full story of my being banned from the UK... is in my new book, FATWA: Hunted in America . Get the book."

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two choices. Example: "While admitting numerous jihad preachers, Britain is keeping out the voices of sanity that would call that nation back to a path that would secure freedom... instead of a path to national suicide."

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a phrase that discourages critical thought by presenting a conclusion as inevitable. Example: "It’s open season on the opposition."

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a distracting, though related, topic to support its point. Example: "It’s like the Geller ban on ads on buses and subways in every major American city: the Catholic Church just tried to run ads on buses in Washington, D.C., and discovered that it couldn’t..."

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that was not presented by redefining the opponent's words. Example: "“Fascism.” By that Bryant means “defending British values.”"

18. Whataboutism – No – The text accuses opponents of hypocrisy but does not use the specific technique of deflecting criticism by pointing to an unrelated offense committed by the accuser.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. It is not a reasoned argument but an emotionally charged piece designed to persuade the reader to adopt the author's viewpoint. It employs a vast number of propaganda techniques, including name-calling ("savages"), appeal to fear ("national suicide"), loaded language ("persecution," "totalitarian"), and logical fallacies like the straw man (redefining "fascism") and the black & white fallacy (presenting a choice between "voices of sanity" and a path to destruction). The author consistently frames herself and her allies as heroic "freedom-fighters" and victims, while demonizing all opposition as either malicious ("über-left pol") or complicit in the "Islamization of the West." The piece culminates in a direct appeal to buy the author's book to get the "full story," cementing its function as a tool for self-promotion and ideological persuasion rather than objective discourse.
