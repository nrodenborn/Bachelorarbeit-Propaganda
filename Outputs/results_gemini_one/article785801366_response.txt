1. Name calling – Yes – Explanation: The text attacks its political opponents with insulting labels, such as calling them "leftist enablers" and describing the previous administration's policy as "pathetic and destructive."
2. Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The text repeatedly reinforces the idea that the Obama administration and "the Left" are enabling the enemy. For example, it mentions the "disastrous Obama administration" and its "pathetic and destructive focus" multiple times to drill the message into the reader.
3. Slogans – Yes – Explanation: The text uses brief, memorable phrases as headings that act as calls to action, such as "Label the Enemy" and "Scrap 'Countering Violent Extremism.'"
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation: The text works to instill fear by describing an "unceasing onslaught by Jihad" and warning that the enemy's goal is to "destroy our civilization from within."
5. Doubt – Yes – Explanation: The text actively seeks to create doubt about the motives and competence of the previous administration and its allies, for instance by highlighting that a supposed "Muslim Brotherhood sympathizer" served on the U.S. Homeland Security Advisory Council.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: The text uses exaggeration to heighten the sense of threat, with phrases like "skyrocketing phenomenon of Muslim migrants stabbing unbelievers" and the claim that the Obama administration allowed the "Muslim Brotherhood to direct American foreign policy."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation: The text appeals to patriotism by framing its proposals as essential for "preserving our civilization" and by contrasting its allies who "actually love America" with opponents who implicitly do not.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases designed to provoke a reaction, such as "Jihadist Psychopath," "suicidal leftist notion," and "totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation: The text does not make a direct comparison to Hitler or Nazis to discredit an idea or group.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – Explanation: The text encourages readers to join a perceived winning side by stating that the "Trump administration has brought in" a "life-saving turn-around disposition" and is already taking the "crucial and constructive steps" the author recommends.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: The text reduces the complex causes of terrorism to a single factor: "Islamic law (Sharia)." It claims that simply labeling this enemy and its ideology will "turn this catastrophic situation around completely."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – Explanation: The text uses vague, broad labels for its opponents, such as "leftist enablers" and "totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces," without clearly defining who belongs to these groups, thereby creating a shadowy, ill-defined enemy.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation: The text repeatedly cites the opinions and recommendations of specific individuals like Robert Spencer and Sebastian Gorka as definitive proof that its proposed strategies are correct, such as, "as Robert Spencer advises, there needs to be legislation..."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation: The text presents only two choices: either adopt its specific "Counter-Jihad" strategy or continue with the "destructive defeat" being implemented by "the Left." It leaves no room for alternative or nuanced approaches.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation: The text uses dismissive statements to end debate, for example, declaring that the “‘Countering Violent Extremism’ is trash and needs to be thrown in the garbage,” which discourages any critical examination of that policy.
16. Red herring – Yes – Explanation: In step 8, the text introduces a complex theological argument ("that Islam cannot be Islam without Jihad") only to immediately state that "the debate over this belongs in another forum," successfully planting a controversial idea while deflecting any need to substantiate it.
17. Straw men – Yes – Explanation: The text refutes a distorted version of an opponent's argument by claiming the "Countering Violent Extremism" policy is primarily concerned with "right-wing Islamophobes," which it presents as the "real threat" in the eyes of the Obama administration. This misrepresents the policy to make it easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – Explanation: The text does not engage in whataboutism; it is consistently on the offensive, making accusations rather than deflecting criticism by pointing out the hypocrisy of others.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and comprehensive example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or present a balanced argument, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly polarized political and ideological viewpoint. This is achieved through the systematic use of a vast majority (16 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques.

The article constructs a simple "us vs. them" narrative using Name Calling, Loaded Language, and the Black & White Fallacy to demonize its opponents ("leftist enablers," "suicidal") while glorifying its allies ("noble and courageous"). It heavily relies on emotional manipulation through Appeal to Fear (the "unceasing onslaught") and Flag-Waving ("love America," "preserving our civilization") to bypass rational analysis.

Furthermore, it distorts reality by using Causal Oversimplification (blaming everything on "Islamic law"), Exaggeration (a "skyrocketing phenomenon"), and Straw Men (misrepresenting the "Countering Violent Extremism" policy). The message is hammered home with Repetition and catchy Slogans, while its credibility is artificially bolstered by a one-sided Appeal to Authority. The combination of these techniques creates a powerful piece of persuasive material designed to provoke an emotional response and incite action based on a fundamentally biased and simplistic worldview, which is the definitive function of propaganda.
