Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels such as "lying CNN," "lying Jim Acosta," "Clown News Network," and calls Acosta a "rude, terrible person."

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate its message.

Appeal to fear – No – The text primarily appeals to anger and a sense of betrayal rather than instilling fear of an alternative.

Doubt – Yes – The text is built around casting doubt on the credibility of Fox News as a conservative outlet, asking, "Do you see who they really are now?"

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the internal makeup of Fox News by stating they have "liberals and neo-cons running rampant."

Flag-Waving – No – The text appeals to a political identity (conservatism) but does not use patriotic appeals or symbols.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "lying," "belligerent," "immature children," and "grandstanding" to frame the subjects in a negative light.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or group to Nazis or other universally hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text argues against a perceived bandwagon (Fox supporting CNN) and instead tries to rally a specific in-group against the popular action.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex legal and political decision of Fox News to support CNN by claiming the sole cause is that Fox is "largely controlled opposition."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites President Trump, Sarah Sanders, and Bob Woodward to support its argument that Acosta's behavior was wrong and the lawsuit was inappropriate. Example: "Trump was right, Acosta is a 'rude, terrible person.'"

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by suggesting that one must either see Fox News as "controlled opposition" or be a lost cause: "Do you see who they really are now? If not, I can't help you."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like "As they should" and "If not, I can't help you" to dismiss counter-arguments and discourage further discussion.

Red herring – Yes – When discussing the legal issue of Acosta's pass, the author introduces a distraction by asking, "where is mine? and yours? How about Infowars?" This shifts the focus from the rights of an established correspondent to the unrelated issue of access for the general public or other outlets.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents Fox News's position. Fox states it is supporting the principle of a free press and against "weaponizing" press passes, but the author reframes this as them simply supporting "lying CNN and lying Jim Acosta" and their specific behavior.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse its targets of hypocrisy by deflecting to other unrelated issues; instead, it directly attacks their character and motives.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the audience to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint by employing a wide array of manipulative techniques. The piece is saturated with Name Calling ("Clown News Network," "lying Jim Acosta") and Loaded Language ("immature children," "belligerent") to create an emotional, rather than a rational, response. It relies heavily on logical fallacies to construct its argument, including a Straw Man (misrepresenting Fox's principled stance as support for bad behavior), Causal Oversimplification (blaming Fox's actions solely on them being "controlled opposition"), a Red Herring (bringing up Infowars), and a Black & White Fallacy (demanding the reader either agree completely or be a lost cause). The argument is bolstered by Appeals to Authority (quoting Trump and Sanders) and shut down by Thought-terminating clichés ("As they should"). The sheer density and variety of these techniques indicate a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's perception rather than engage in a good-faith argument.
