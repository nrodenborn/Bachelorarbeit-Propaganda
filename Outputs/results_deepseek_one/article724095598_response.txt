### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 95% –** The text is highly likely propaganda. It employs **13 of 18 techniques**, primarily:  
- **Appeal to fear** (terrorist infiltration) and **doubt** (questioning official accounts) to manipulate emotions.  
- **Loaded language** ("horrific," "shockingly") and **exaggeration** ("conclusive fact") amplify bias.  
- **Obfuscation** ("secret intel," vague "evidence") and **causal oversimplification** (blaming border security) avoid factual scrutiny.  
- **Bandwagon** references to media and **appeal to authority** (congressman) create false credibility.  
- **Red herring** (girlfriend’s Facebook) distracts from unsubstantiated claims.  
The article’s core narrative—unverified ISIS links and border threats—relies on emotional triggers, logical fallacies, and cherry-picked "evidence" to advance a specific agenda, aligning with propaganda’s goal to persuade rather than inform.
