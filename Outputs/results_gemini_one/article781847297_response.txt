***

Verdict – 5% – This text is a news article from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a news organization. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about an event: President Trump’s tweets concerning Reality Winner’s prison sentence. The article itself is not propaganda; rather, it is *reporting on* the use of propaganda techniques by the subjects of the story (primarily Donald Trump and, to a lesser extent, Reality Winner). It maintains a neutral, journalistic tone by attributing all statements and opinions to their sources (e.g., "Trump wrote," "Winner’s mother had a blunt reply," "her mother told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution"). The text provides context and presents the facts of the event without overtly trying to persuade the audience to adopt a particular viewpoint. While the actions and quotes described within the article are examples of propaganda, the article itself is an example of journalism.
