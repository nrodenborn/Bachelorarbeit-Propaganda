1. Name calling – Yes – The text attacks President Obama with an insulting label/image by stating, "Of course, we know what Obama did with his daily briefings. They are somewhere in the White House sewer system."
2. Repetition – Yes – The central claim that Russia funneled money through lobbyists to the Clinton Foundation to secure the Uranium One deal is repeated and rephrased throughout the article, citing various sources to reinforce the same message.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by framing the issue as a matter of national security and "treason," suggesting Russia gained control of "20 percent of American uranium mining assets" and was simultaneously aiding Iran's nuclear program.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the credibility of opponents by stating, "While Democrats have unsurprisingly questioned Campbell's credibility..." and by linking a critical Yahoo News article to "Michael Isikoff (of FISA warrant application fame)," implying the journalist is untrustworthy.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the certainty of the claims by stating in the headline that Moscow "Paid Millions" as if it were a confirmed fact, and by asserting at the beginning, "Right off the bat, this appears to be clear bribery, and a case could be made for treason."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The article begins by quoting Article 2, Section 4 of the US Constitution and immediately frames the allegations as "Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors," appealing to patriotism and the nation's founding laws.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the reader, such as "nefarious actions," "White House sewer system," and "land grabs that are unconstitutionally orchestrated."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea to validate it.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text implies the complex, multi-agency approval of the Uranium One sale was caused solely by a simple bribery scheme, ignoring or downplaying any other potential geopolitical or economic factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text is intentionally vague when it mentions, "There is also substantial documentation that was discovered in Oregon that relates to this deal... which got zero coverage in the mainstream media," without specifying what the documents contain or how they are relevant.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text relies heavily on the testimony of specific individuals presented as authorities, such as "informant, Douglas Campbell," "The Hill's John Solomon," "Award-winning... Sara Carter," and Campbell's attorney "Victoria Toensing."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy in its conclusion: "...in the end, all we ever get is excuses rather than justice," presenting only two possible outcomes while ignoring any other possibilities or nuances.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase "Time will tell" to discourage further critical thought about the unresolved questions it raises.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces an irrelevant topic to distract by suddenly bringing up "ranchers in the western united States and how this impacts them, as well as the land grabs that are unconstitutionally orchestrated by the DC government and the Bureau of Land Management."
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified argument by stating, "While Democrats have unsurprisingly questioned Campbell's credibility..." This dismisses their position as purely partisan without addressing any specific, substantive reasons they might have for their skepticism.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect blame by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a piece of objective journalism but a persuasive article constructed to lead the reader to a specific conclusion: that Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration committed bribery and treason. It achieves this by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. The article builds its entire case on appeals to a few select authorities while casting doubt on any counter-narrative. It uses flag-waving and appeals to fear (treason, Russian control of uranium) to create a sense of urgency and national peril. The language is heavily loaded with emotional and accusatory terms. Furthermore, it utilizes logical fallacies like red herrings and causal oversimplification to buttress its argument and introduces vague conspiracies to create an atmosphere of widespread corruption. The sheer number and variety of techniques used indicate a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than inform it.
