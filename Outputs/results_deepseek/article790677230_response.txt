Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "desperate Democrats" (Paragraph 3), "underhanded tactics" (Paragraph 2), "sordid behavior" (Grassley section), "porn star lawyers" (Hatch quote).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "sham" repeated 4 times (Trump tweet, Graham quote, Hatch quote).  
3. **Slogans** – No – No standalone memorable phrases used as slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "Democrats are trying to drag the confirmation... hope to seize control" (Paragraph near end) implies losing power/control.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "ridiculous overall story" (Ford description), "conveniently has no corroborating evidence" (Davis tweet), "implausible, internally contradictory story" (Mitchell critique).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "most despicable thing" (Graham), "worst in our politics" (Hatch). Minimization: Ford's testimony reduced to "vague and sometimes evasive" despite "100%" claim.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "national disgrace" (Graham/Hatch), "embarrassment" to institutions (Kavanaugh quote), appeals to American process ("bipartisan investigation").  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "righteous indignation," "stonewalling," "character assassination," "search and destroy strategy," "circus atmosphere."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "Kavanaugh stole the show," Fox commentators' shifted opinions post-testimony implying growing consensus.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames Democrats solely for the controversy: "Consistent with their stated desires to obstruct" (Grassley), "Democrats’ sordid behavior."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct, not obscured.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Quotes from Trump, Grassley, Graham, Hatch, and commentators (Hume, Napolitano, Davis) used as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Graham frames vote as "legitimizing the most despicable thing" vs. rejecting the "sham." No middle ground acknowledged.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "total sham," "national disgrace," "search and destroy strategy" shut down critical analysis.  
16. **Red herring** – No – No major irrelevant distractions; focuses on hearing/process.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Portrays Democrats as solely wanting to "destroy this guy's life" (Graham) and gain power, ignoring other motivations like investigating assault claims.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No counter-accusations of hypocrisy unrelated to the core issue.  

---

**Verdict – 90%** – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It systematically employs loaded language, name-calling, and emotional appeals (fear, patriotism) to vilify Democrats and glorify Kavanaugh/Republicans. Key indicators include:  
- **One-sided framing**: Exclusively highlights Republican perspectives (Grassley, Graham, Hatch, Trump) while dismissing Ford’s allegations as "ridiculous" and "implausible."  
- **Demonization**: Labels Democratic actions as "underhanded," "sordid," and a "sham," framing them as conspiratorial ("lying in wait," "secret evidence").  
- **Selective facts**: Emphasizes Kavanaugh’s denials and GOP efforts while downplaying Ford’s testimony and omitting Democratic rebuttals.  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Uses indignation ("righteous indignation"), fear (Democrats "seizing control"), and appeals to national identity ("national disgrace").  
- **Pattern of techniques**: Multiple techniques (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, black/white fallacy) reinforce a singular narrative: Democrats are corrupt obstructionists, while Kavanaugh is an honorable victim.  
While it reports factual elements (e.g., hearing procedures, quotes), their presentation is skewed to persuade, not inform. The absence of neutral analysis or Democratic viewpoints confirms its role as advocacy propaganda.
