1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the MEK as “‘Former Terrorists’” in the headline and a “formerly terrorist-classified organization” in the body, and refers to US officials as “neoconservative war hawks.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to promote its own message, though it does quote John Bolton using one.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests the plan to overthrow Iran is the “impetus behind what could kick of World War 3” and warns of creating “horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias” similar to Syria, Iraq, and Libya.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of US foreign policy by highlighting the contradiction of the US training an organization (MEK) while it was officially classified as a terrorist group, and by questioning “neocon attempts to rewrite history.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by claiming this plan could “kick of World War 3.” It also minimizes the nature of the Iranian government by stating it is “certainly no bastion of freedom,” which is a significant understatement used to strengthen the argument against intervention.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism; instead, it is highly critical of US national policy and actions.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “neoconservative war hawks,” “outright insane,” and “war-ravaged dystopias” to evoke strong negative feelings about the subject.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with hated groups like Nazis to discredit it.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest its ideas are popular. Instead, it frames its audience as the enlightened few “who may not be paying attention” or “those paying attention over the years.”
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes decades of complex US foreign policy in the Middle East to a single, simple cause: a neocon plan to “take out seven countries in five years” as if it were a simple checklist being followed by successive presidents.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; it makes very direct and specific accusations against named individuals and groups.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites authorities like “Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh” and “General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO” to support its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between US intervention, which it claims leads to a “war-ravaged dystopia,” and the status quo. It ignores other potential outcomes or diplomatic options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases to shut down discussion; on the contrary, it attempts to provoke a specific line of critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll asking “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is entirely unrelated to the article's main topic of foreign policy towards Iran and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text characterizes the argument for intervention as the simple, “outright insane” idea that a “violent revolution would be beneficial,” which is an oversimplified and easily refutable version of the pro-interventionist position.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges the US government with hypocrisy by pointing out that it trained and supported the MEK “during this training period” when it was still officially “classified as a terrorist organization by the United States.”

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a majority (12 out of 18) of the listed techniques to promote a specific, one-sided narrative: that US foreign policy is controlled by a sinister "neocon" conspiracy aimed at violently overthrowing governments in the Middle East. The article is not a balanced piece of journalism; it is a persuasive piece designed to provoke outrage and distrust in the US government. It strategically uses `Appeal to authority` (Hersh, Clark) to appear credible, but frames its narrative with `Loaded Language` ("war hawks," "dystopias"), `Name calling` ("Former Terrorists"), and `Appeal to fear` ("World War 3"). It simplifies complex geopolitical history into a `Causal Oversimplification` (the "seven countries" checklist) and presents a `Black & white fallacy` regarding the available options in Iran. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant `Red herring` poll about "corrupt" Democrats further reveals its intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and political biases rather than to inform them objectively. The combination of these techniques makes it a clear example of propaganda.
