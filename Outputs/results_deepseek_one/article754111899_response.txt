Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used to attack any subject.  
2. **Repetition** – No – No phrase or message is repeated excessively for emphasis.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., rallying cries) are present.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – While Ebola's severity is described (e.g., "severe, often fatal illness"), the text does not exploit fear to promote a specific action or agenda.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility (e.g., of sources, institutions, or data) occurs.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Statistics and risks (e.g., death tolls, transmission methods) are reported factually without apparent amplification or downplaying.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty.  
8. **Loaded Language** – No – Language is neutral and clinical (e.g., "hemorrhagic fever," "transmitted," "outbreaks"); no emotionally charged words or stereotypes.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or other universally maligned groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeals to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees") to validate claims.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The complexity of Ebola’s spread (e.g., animal-to-human transmission, human-to-human transmission) is acknowledged without reduction to a single cause.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are specific (e.g., locations, case numbers, virus strain) and clearly presented.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Sources (e.g., health ministry, WHO) are cited for factual reporting, not as unquestionable proof to sway opinion.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dilemmas are presented; the text acknowledges nuances (e.g., sporadic cases post-epidemic).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases (e.g., "it is what it is") used to shut down discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions; the text stays focused on Ebola’s history and current cases.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy or deflections to other issues.  

---

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is a straightforward, factual news report about Ebola cases in the DRC. It cites official sources (government health officials, WHO), presents data neutrally (case numbers, transmission methods, historical context), and avoids persuasive language, emotional manipulation, or partisan framing. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges that *any* reporting on health crises could subtly influence public perception, but there is no evidence of deliberate propaganda intent, distortion, or technique application here. The purpose appears purely informational.
