Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly attacks its opponents with insulting labels, including “leftist totalitarians,” “leftist brownshirt-style assault,” the “SPLC hate machine,” the “fascist Left,” and the “Stalinist Left.”

Repetition – Yes – The core message that social media platforms and “the Left” are engaged in a coordinated, totalitarian effort to silence conservatives and free speech is repeated constantly throughout the article in different ways.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses a brief, memorable phrase to serve as a rallying cry: “The battle for America -- and for the West -- is on.”

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text aims to instill fear by describing a “totalitarian plantation,” a “Stalinist Left's war on America,” and an effort to “suffocate dissent,” suggesting a dire future if the opposition is not stopped.

Doubt – Yes – The text explicitly questions Facebook’s stated reason for lifting the ban, asserting, “We have no doubt, of course, that no ‘mistake’ had actually occurred in this matter and that the ban has only been lifted because of the publicity that we engaged in”.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text heavily exaggerates the nature of a temporary social media ban, describing it with terms like “totalitarian attack,” “tyrannical behavior,” and “brownshirt-style assault.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the conflict as a fight for core American values, referring to it as the “battle for America,” an effort to “protect America and the West,” and a defense of “our liberties.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is saturated with emotionally charged words intended to provoke a reaction rather than convey information neutrally. Examples include “Jihadist Psychopath,” “tyrannical,” “fascistic,” “vicious lie,” and “venomous.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text directly compares its opponents to hated totalitarian groups, using phrases like “leftist brownshirt-style assault” (a reference to Nazi paramilitaries), “fascistic manner,” and “fascist Left.” It also uses “Stalinist Left,” which is a similar technique.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text lists numerous other conservative figures and media outlets (Breitbart, Michelle Malkin, Laura Loomer, etc.) who support their cause, creating the impression of a large and growing movement that the reader should join.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue by claiming that all content moderation against conservatives is part of a single, malicious political agenda by “the Left,” ignoring other potential factors like automated systems, specific policy violations, or user reports.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text’s language, while hyperbolic, is generally direct in its accusations. Its primary goal is to incite a clear emotional response through strong claims, not to confuse the audience with vague or obscure language.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites individuals it portrays as authorities to bolster its claims, such as “Leading scholar of Islam and JihadWatch.org Director Robert Spencer” and “Leading brave conservative figures such as Michelle Malkin.”

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two choices: supporting the “brave conservative truth-tellers” in their fight for “free speech,” or siding with the “fascist Left” in its “war on America.” It leaves no room for nuance, complexity, or a middle ground.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like “It goes without saying” to present an opinion as an undisputed fact, discouraging further thought. The final line, “The battle for America -- and for the West -- is on,” serves to end debate and call for action.

Red herring – Yes – While the article is ostensibly about Jamie Glazov’s ban, it introduces numerous other cases (Alex Jones, Robert Spencer, Ron DeSantis, the David Horowitz Freedom Center) to distract from the specifics of the original event and paint a picture of a much larger, conspiratorial conflict.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents its opponent's position to make it easier to attack. It claims Facebook’s action “suggested, of course, that giving advice on how to prevent another 9/11... is now against Facebook’s ‘community standards’,” which is an extreme interpretation of a "community standards" violation that Facebook itself never stated.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text consistently charges its opponents with hypocrisy. It frames social media platforms, which may publicly support free expression, as being the real “totalitarians” and “fascists” for their alleged censorship of conservatives, thereby deflecting from any potential rule violations by the conservatives themselves.

***

Verdict – 100% – This text is a textbook example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade, mobilize, and inflame a specific audience. It achieves this by employing an overwhelming number of propaganda techniques (17 out of the 18 listed).

The entire piece is built on a one-sided, good-versus-evil narrative: the “brave truth-tellers” and “noble” conservatives are under a “totalitarian attack” from a monolithic, evil entity referred to as “the Left,” “the fascist Left,” and the “Stalinist Left.” The language is not descriptive but intensely emotional and loaded (“tyrannical,” “vicious,” “venomous”). It uses exaggeration to elevate a temporary social media ban into a “brownshirt-style assault” and a “war on America.”

The article systematically demonizes its opposition through name-calling and reduction ad Hitlerum, while simultaneously creating a bandwagon effect by listing allies. It oversimplifies the complex issue of content moderation into a simple political conspiracy and uses red herrings to conflate multiple separate incidents into one grand attack. The text makes no attempt to present a balanced view, engage with opposing arguments fairly, or provide verifiable evidence beyond its own assertions and links to friendly sources. Its ultimate goal is to provoke fear and anger, rally its base, and solicit action (follow on social media, contact representatives, buy a book), which is the core function of propaganda.
