1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the term "illegals" to refer to undocumented immigrants, which is a label used to dehumanize and insult the group. Example: "Often, by putting illegals into the system, it takes years to deport them..."

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times in a row.

3. Slogans – Yes – The headline "Illegals Have To Go!" serves as a brief and memorable phrase summarizing the article's position.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states, “The Democrats want open borders and they don’t care about crime,” which is designed to create fear about the consequences of the opposing political party's policies.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on a media report by stating, "...blasting the New York Times report that said he didn't really want to sign his executive order last week..."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the complexity of immigration policy by referring to the proposal as a "simple immigration plan" and "A nice simple system that works." It also exaggerates the opposing view: “The Democrats want open borders and they don’t care about crime.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a matter of protecting national resources: "It is time that Congress sure up things so that America's tax dollars are not bound up in a worthless judicial process..."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "illegals," "ripped," and "worthless" to influence the reader's perception. For example: "...bound up in a worthless judicial process when people are clearly in the country illegally."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with a group like Nazis or other groups hated by the target audience.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that the proposed plan is good simply because it is popular or that "everyone is doing it."

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a "simple immigration plan" as the solution to the complex issue of immigration, suggesting the problem is merely that "illegals" are not sent "out" immediately.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text's message is direct and not deliberately obscure. It clearly states its position on immigration.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article heavily relies on quotes from President Donald Trump, using his position as President to lend credibility to the proposed plan.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy: “We want strong borders and we want no crime. The Democrats want open borders and they don’t care about crime.” This frames the situation as having only two extreme options.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The headline "Illegals Have To Go!" acts as a thought-terminating cliché, presenting a simplistic and final solution to a complex problem, discouraging nuanced discussion.

16. Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of the poll "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is irrelevant to the immigration plan being discussed and serves to distract the reader and attack the political opposition.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an exaggerated and inaccurate version of the opposition's stance by claiming, “The Democrats want open borders and they don’t care about crime,” which is not the actual argument presented by the Democratic party.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text attacks the opposition but does not use the specific tactic of deflecting criticism by accusing the opponent of hypocrisy for a past or unrelated action.

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint. This is evident through the overwhelming use of numerous propaganda techniques. The article employs loaded language ("illegals," "worthless"), name-calling, and appeals to fear to create a strong emotional reaction against immigrants and the Democratic party. It presents a black & white fallacy by framing the issue as a choice between Trump's "simple" plan for safety and the Democrats' supposed desire for "open borders" and "crime." This is a straw man argument that misrepresents the opposition's position. Furthermore, the inclusion of the repetitive and irrelevant poll about "corrupt" Democrats is a blatant red herring designed to distract and reinforce negative sentiment towards the opposition. The entire piece, from its slogan-like headline to its oversimplification of a complex issue, is structured to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than encourage critical thought.
