Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against opponents or alternatives.
2.  **Repetition** – No – While the support for gun control is mentioned multiple times, the *exact same message* is not repeated verbatim over and over.
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – "Policies like background checks on all gun sales and Red Flag Laws save lives" is a brief, memorable phrase advocating the policy.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Citing the Parkland shooting ("gunned down", "fear of being gunned down") is used to instill fear and support the proposed gun control measures.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not actively question the credibility of opponents or alternatives.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – While strong language is used ("gunned down", "crisis"), the claims (policies save lives, mayors on the frontlines) are presented as factual assertions without clear evidence of being significantly overstated or understated within the context.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Phrases like "gunned down", "live free of the fear", "crisis", and "life-saving laws" evoke strong emotional responses (fear, urgency, desire for safety) beyond simple description.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt is made to link opponents or ideas to universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – While the support of the Conference of Mayors and Everytown is mentioned, the text doesn't explicitly argue that people *should* support the measures *because* they are popular or everyone is doing it.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text presents the resolutions as responses to complex issues (gun violence, school shootings) but doesn't explicitly claim a *single, simple cause* or that these policies alone are the *simple solution*.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The policies mentioned (background checks, Red Flag Laws, banning assault weapons) are named specifically, and the goals ("save lives", "keep communities safe") are clear, even if the mechanisms aren't detailed here.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The credibility of the U.S. Conference of Mayors ("bipartisan", "50-year history") and Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson is used to support the argument. John Feinblatt (Everytown President) is also cited as a supportive authority.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – John Feinblatt's statement "It’s time for our leaders in Washington to... put public safety over NRA priorities" presents only two options: supporting the mayors' resolutions (public safety) or supporting the NRA's priorities. It ignores potential middle ground or other policy approaches.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "common sense" (though "common-sense laws" is used, it's not employed here specifically to shut down discussion) or "it is what it is" are used in a way that clearly discourages critical thought.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on gun control resolutions and their justification; no irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument not actually made by opponents.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are made against opponents to deflect criticism.

**Verdict – 25% –** The text exhibits several propaganda techniques (Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy), primarily within the quotes from the mayors and Everytown representative. These techniques are used to advocate for the gun control resolutions emotionally and persuasively. However, the core of the text is a factual report on resolutions passed by a specific organization, including direct quotes from its leaders and supportive groups. The techniques are present but not overwhelmingly dominant; the piece still functions primarily as advocacy reporting based on a real event rather than pure propaganda. The likelihood it *is* propaganda is low-to-moderate (25%), as its primary purpose seems to be reporting an advocacy position taken by an organization, using their own persuasive language.
