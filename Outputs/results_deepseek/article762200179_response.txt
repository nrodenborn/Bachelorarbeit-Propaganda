3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed for rallying support (e.g., campaign-style slogans).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Implied in warnings that Iran gaining financial access threatens security (e.g., "doing business with Iran is no longer permissible" and references to sanctions evasion).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – GOP report explicitly questions Obama admin's credibility: "The Obama administration misled the American people and Congress...".  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes –  
   - *Exaggeration*: GOP frames a limited transaction as "secretly trying to give Tehran access to the US financial system."  
   - *Minimization*: Obama officials call the story "widely overblown" and stress the transaction was legal/narrow.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No overt appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "desperate to get a deal," "misled," "secretly," "dodge sanctions," "drive them nuts" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to hated groups or ideologies.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – GOP implies the *sole* motive was desperation for a deal, ignoring complex diplomatic/legal obligations.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Both sides use specific details (e.g., transaction mechanics, legal justifications).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Both sides cite officials (e.g., Lew, Szubin, Blanc) to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – GOP frames the issue as either "no access" (good) or "broad access" (bad), ignoring the limited, legal middle ground described by officials.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "case closed" or "end of story" to stifle debate.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – GOP ties the transaction to the 1979 embassy seizure (irrelevant to the 2016 deal’s legality).  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – GOP accuses Obama admin of seeking "broad access" to the financial system, while officials explicitly refuted this (citing narrow, legal conversions).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., "what about X scandal?").

**Verdict – 70% –**  
The text exhibits significant propaganda elements, primarily from the GOP report and its supporters. Techniques like **name-calling** ("misled"), **doubt**, **exaggeration** (framing a limited transaction as systemic access), **loaded language** ("desperate," "secretly"), **causal oversimplification** (reducing motives to "desperation"), **black & white fallacy** (ignoring nuanced legality), **appeal to fear** (implied threats of Iran's access), and **straw men** (misrepresenting Obama’s actions) dominate the GOP narrative. While the text includes counterarguments from Obama officials (providing balance and factual context), the GOP claims are presented more sensationally, using emotionally charged language and selective framing to discredit political opponents. The article’s focus on unverified accusations ("secretly trying to give access") over the documented legality of the transaction further leans toward propaganda. However, the inclusion of direct rebuttals and technical details prevents it from being purely propagandistic.
