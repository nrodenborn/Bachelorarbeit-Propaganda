Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques suggest a significant likelihood of the text being propaganda, as they aim to influence the audience's perception of immigration enforcement and sanctuary policies. However, the text also provides factual information about arrests and criminal histories, which tempers the overall assessment.
