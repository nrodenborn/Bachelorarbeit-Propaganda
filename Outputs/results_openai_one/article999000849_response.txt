Certainly! Here is the analysis according to your requested format:

---

1. **Name calling** – Yes – The text uses the label "Globalist billionaire George Soros" and refers to migrants as "illegal aliens," both of which are loaded, negative terms.
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The phrase "Soros-backed" or "Soros-funded" is repeated multiple times, reinforcing the association.
3. **Slogans** – No – There is no brief, memorable phrase used as a rallying cry in the text.
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text describes the migrants as planning to “rush” the border, refers to an “impending migrant invasion,” and mentions the deployment of troops, all of which are intended to instill fear.
5. **Doubt** – Yes – The text questions the legitimacy of the migrants’ asylum claims, stating "mostly consists of migrants with ineligible asylum claims" and "None of these are eligible asylum claims, Breitbart reports."
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The text exaggerates the threat by using terms like “impending migrant invasion” and “rush the border,” and minimizes the legitimacy of asylum seekers by calling them “job-seekers” and “previously deported illegal aliens.”
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by describing the deployment of U.S. troops and law enforcement to “thwart” the caravan and protect the border.
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Terms like “Globalist billionaire,” “illegal aliens,” “impending migrant invasion,” and “thwart” are emotionally charged and appeal to stereotypes.
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There is no comparison to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not claim that a majority supports its position or encourage the reader to join a popular movement.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text implies that Soros funding and lawyers are directly responsible for the caravan’s actions and the border situation, oversimplifying a complex issue.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – The text uses vague terms like "reports that they plan to 'rush' the border" without specifying sources or details.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Breitbart News as authorities to support its claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text presents the situation as a clear-cut threat (invasion) that must be stopped, with no middle ground.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no clichés used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The inclusion of the Jim Acosta poll and discussion about press passes is irrelevant to the main topic and distracts from the central issue.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent an opposing argument to refute it.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy by referencing unrelated actions.

**Verdict – 95% –**  
The text exhibits a high likelihood of being propaganda. It employs numerous propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, exaggeration, loaded language, flag-waving, and more. The narrative is constructed to evoke strong emotional reactions, particularly fear and suspicion, and to delegitimize both the migrants and those assisting them by associating them with a controversial figure (Soros) and using negative labels. The text also simplifies complex issues, uses vague and unsubstantiated claims, and introduces distractions irrelevant to the main topic. While it does include some factual reporting, the overwhelming use of manipulative techniques and emotionally charged language strongly indicates propagandistic intent.
