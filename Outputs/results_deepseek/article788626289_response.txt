Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "Muslim Brotherhood Congressman Hakim Muhammad, aka Keith Ellison" (Uses the controversial "Muslim Brotherhood" label and his former name as an insulting label).
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – "Muslim Brotherhood" is repeated multiple times (headline, opening paragraph).
3.  **Slogans** – No – No distinct, memorable phrase used as a slogan within the presented text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the topic involves abuse, the text doesn't primarily use fear of alternatives to support an idea.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "as if anyone didn’t know that by now" (casts doubt on the sincerity of Democrats' #MeToo stance).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "abundant evidence" vs. "absolutely no evidence whatsoever" (Exaggerates the strength of evidence in Monahan's case while minimizing/denying any evidence in Ford's case).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Muslim Brotherhood", "abused her", "in a lather", "pure politically-motivated hypocrisy", "worried about retribution" (Uses emotionally charged, negative, and prejudicial terms).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – "Muslim Brotherhood Congressman" (Associates Ellison with a group widely condemned in US political discourse to discredit him).
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Does not appeal to the popularity of the idea it's promoting.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Doesn't oversimplify a complex cause for an event.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is relatively direct in its accusations.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While a doctor's report is cited, the text doesn't primarily use an authority's support *as the key evidence* for its main political claim (the hypocrisy); the report supports the abuse allegation.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – "all their #MeToo rhetoric is pure politically-motivated hypocrisy" (Presents Democrats' entire #MeToo stance as solely hypocritical with no nuance).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" or "just common sense" used to shut down thought.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The poll about Nikki Haley's UN replacement is completely irrelevant to the topic of domestic abuse allegations against Keith Ellison. It serves only as a distraction.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text attacks the Democrats' perceived hypocrisy based on their actions (supporting Ellison while attacking Kavanaugh), not a misrepresented version of their argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – "But while the Democrats are in a lather over Ford and Kavanaugh... they couldn’t care less about Karen Monahan. And that shows that all their #MeToo rhetoric is pure politically-motivated hypocrisy" (Charges Democrats with hypocrisy by pointing to their different handling of another case).

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is not neutral reporting but to advance a specific, highly partisan narrative: that Democrats and Keith Ellison are hypocritical and associated with a feared group (Muslim Brotherhood), while dismissing the Kavanaugh/Ford allegations. Key indicators include:
*   **Heavy Use of Loaded Language & Name-Calling:** "Muslim Brotherhood Congressman Hakim Muhammad" is a deliberate, inflammatory label designed to provoke fear and distrust.
*   **Whataboutism & Black/White Fallacy:** The core argument relies on contrasting the Ellison and Kavanaugh cases to paint all Democratic #MeToo rhetoric as pure hypocrisy, ignoring nuance or differing contexts.
*   **Exaggeration/Minimization:** The stark contrast drawn between "abundant evidence" and "absolutely no evidence" is a clear exaggeration used to discredit one claim and bolster the other.
*   **Reduction ad Hitlerum:** Associating Ellison with the "Muslim Brotherhood" is a classic tactic to discredit by linking to a vilified group.
*   **Red Herring:** Including the irrelevant poll about Nikki Haley is a clear distraction tactic.
*   **Lack of Neutrality:** The language throughout is highly emotive and accusatory ("pure politically-motivated hypocrisy," "in a lather," "they couldn’t care less"). While presenting facts about the doctor's report, the framing and surrounding commentary are overtly manipulative and aimed at discrediting a political opponent and his party. The text prioritizes pushing a specific ideological viewpoint over balanced information.
