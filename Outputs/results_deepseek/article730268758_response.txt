Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "predator priests" (labels clergy as predators), "principal in a cover-up" (directly labels the Pope).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated emphasis on the Pope "ignoring" warnings (e.g., "ignored them all," "told from the moment... that this was a bad decision").  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warns that the Pope’s actions set a dangerous precedent mimicked by bishops, risking child safety: "this is the kind of behavior that is going to be mimicked around the world... why should I?"  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Pope Francis’ credibility: "the Pope’s professed empathy for abuse victims has come into question," and his claims "have proven to be false."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates the scandal as "epic proportions," "so heinous," and minimizes the Pope’s response as "shrug[ging] his shoulders."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or group identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms like "cover-up," "betrayed," "slander," and "heinous" permeate the text.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on the popularity of the claims.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text details multiple factors (letters, meetings, testimony) behind the scandal.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Language is direct and specific (e.g., cites letters, meetings, judicial findings).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Relies on Elizabeth Yore’s expertise ("attorney and child advocate") and victim testimony to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Acknowledges context (e.g., Pope’s apologies, commission efforts).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – Focus remains on the abuse scandal; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Refutes the Pope’s actual statements (e.g., denial of receiving evidence).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting critics.  

**Verdict – 40%** – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, appeal to fear) and presents allegations against Pope Francis in a predominantly one-sided, emotionally charged manner. However, it is not purely propaganda. It cites specific evidence (victim letters, judicial findings, witness testimony) and sources (Yore, Cruz, O’Malley), grounding claims in documented events. While it selectively emphasizes facts to condemn the Pope and uses sensational language ("epic proportions," "heinous"), it does not invent falsehoods outright. The presence of verifiable details (e.g., Scicluna’s investigation, the 2015 letter) and lack of overt fabrications reduce its propagandistic nature, though its framing is clearly biased. Thus, it is more accurately described as advocacy journalism with propagandistic elements than outright propaganda.
