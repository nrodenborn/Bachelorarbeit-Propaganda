Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the mayors as "criminal mayors" and sarcastically as "These geniuses."

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times consecutively.

Slogans – No – The text analyzes or criticizes slogans used by others (e.g., #NeverAgain, "Stand Your Ground") but does not use its own brief, memorable phrases to promote its central idea.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that the proposed policies will leave citizens vulnerable by stating they "[side] with criminals against law-abiding citizens as it opposes stand your ground and other measures written specifically to protect people who would normally be victims of crime."

Doubt – Yes – The text constantly questions the motives and claims of the mayors, for instance: "How any of this is consistent with support for the Second Amendment is anyone's guess."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline frames the proposed policies as "Gun Confiscation Legislation," which is an exaggeration of the listed proposals (which include bans on certain types, background checks, and red flag laws, not a general confiscation).

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text repeatedly appeals to patriotism and constitutional rights, framing the debate as an attack on fundamental American freedoms: "...the Second Amendment recognizes the right to keep and bear arms is a right given to us by our Creator..."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as "hypocrisy," "infringe on law-abiding citizens' rights," and "attacking it head on."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare the mayors or their policies to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest its viewpoint is correct because it is popular. Instead, it frames its position as being in opposition to a powerful group (the US Conference of Mayors).

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simplified cause-and-effect relationship by stating that the proposed laws will not work for the simple reason that criminals, by definition, do not follow laws: "Because they won't follow your unconstitutional and unlawful laws in the first place!"

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and clear in its arguments and accusations; it does not use intentionally vague or confusing language.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text appeals to a divine authority to support its argument: "...the Second Amendment recognizes the right to keep and bear arms is a right given to us by our Creator, not a permission we gain from government."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between supporting the Second Amendment absolutely or attacking it, with no room for nuance or regulation: "So, while they tell you they support the Second Amendment and that their unlawful policies are consistent with it, nothing could be further from the truth."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses blunt, declarative statements to shut down discussion, such as the simple answer "It doesn't" to the rhetorical question "How does any of this stop gun violence?"

Red herring – Yes – The text inserts a poll asking, "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" This is irrelevant to the specific gun control policies being debated and serves to distract the reader and associate the issue with unrelated partisan grievances.

Straw men – Yes – The author misrepresents the mayors' position by claiming their stated support for the Second Amendment is a cover for their true intention: "I think they throw that language in to cover for the fact that they are attacking it head on and attacking the rights of the people." This refutes a motive the author has invented, not the mayors' actual argument.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text explicitly accuses the mayors of hypocrisy: "Part of the hypocrisy of the US Conference of Mayors is that they actually push to infringe on law-abiding citizens' rights while claiming that it is consistent with the Second Amendment."

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. It employs a vast majority (14 out of 18) of the listed techniques to promote its viewpoint. The article's purpose is not to inform or foster a nuanced debate, but to persuade the reader by appealing to emotion, demonizing the opposition, and using logical fallacies.

The piece systematically frames the "US Conference of Mayors" as a malicious entity using techniques like **Name-calling** ("criminal mayors"), **Exaggeration** ("Gun Confiscation"), and **Loaded Language** ("hypocrisy," "attacking"). It creates a false narrative about their intentions using a **Straw Man** argument (claiming their support for the 2nd Amendment is a lie) and accuses them of **Whataboutism** ("hypocrisy").

The argument relies heavily on emotional manipulation through **Appeal to Fear** (suggesting citizens will be defenseless) and **Flag-Waving** (invoking the Constitution and "our Creator" as ultimate authorities). It deliberately avoids complex reasoning by using **Causal Oversimplification** (criminals don't follow laws, so laws are pointless), a **Black & White Fallacy** (you either support the 2nd Amendment completely or you're an enemy), and **Thought-terminating clichés** ("It doesn't.").

Finally, it uses structural tricks like **Repetition** and a blatant **Red Herring** (the poll about corrupt Democrats) to distract from the core topic and reinforce a partisan "us vs. them" mentality. The one-sided presentation, reliance on logical fallacies, and intense emotional language are all hallmarks of a propaganda piece rather than a journalistic or argumentative one.
