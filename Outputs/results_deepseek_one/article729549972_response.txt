Here's the analysis of the text "NASA captures farthest ever image from Earth" against the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against any subject.
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific message or phrase is repeated excessively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as slogans (like "BUILD THE WALL").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear against alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The credibility of any person or entity is not questioned.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Achievements ("record-breaking," "farthest ever," "most-distant") are stated factually based on the mission's parameters. There's no apparent overstatement or understatement beyond reporting the milestones.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – Language is largely neutral and descriptive (e.g., "diverse landscape," "frozen ice," "healthy and functioning properly"). Words like "historic," "record-breaking," and "famously" convey achievement but are factual descriptors in this context, not emotionally manipulative or stereotyping.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea to convince the reader.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text describes events and achievements without attributing complex outcomes to single, simple causes.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The language is clear and specific about the mission, distances, dates, and instruments (e.g., "3.79 billion miles," "Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI)", "1 January 2019").
13. **Appeal to authority** – *Possible, but weak/No* – NASA is cited as the source of information and images, which is standard journalistic practice for reporting on its own missions. Statements like "according to NASA" establish source credibility rather than being a fallacious appeal to shut down criticism or convince solely based on authority. Carl Sagan is mentioned historically, not used to argue a point.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No complex issue is presented with only two stark choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to discourage critical thought or end discussion (e.g., "It is what it is," "That's just the way things are").
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the New Horizons mission, its achievements, and its future plans. Historical references (Voyager, Sagan) provide relevant context.
17. **Straw men** – No – No opposing arguments are presented, let alone misrepresented.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are made against any person or group.

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is overwhelmingly a straightforward, factual report on the achievements and status of the NASA New Horizons mission. It cites its source (NASA), reports specific details (distances, dates, instruments), and provides relevant historical context. While it highlights NASA's successes and uses words like "historic" and "record-breaking," this is a factual description of the mission milestones within the context of space exploration, not an attempt to manipulate emotions or promote a specific agenda beyond informing the public about scientific progress. The lack of any clear application of the defined propaganda techniques strongly indicates it is not propaganda. The minor percentage (5%) acknowledges that any press release inherently aims to present its subject (NASA, in this case) in a positive light by reporting its successes, but this falls far short of employing manipulative propaganda techniques.
