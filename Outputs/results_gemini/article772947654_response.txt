Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Vladimir Putin as the “Russian dictator” and describes a part of the Democratic Party as the “radical-extremist wing.”

Repetition – Yes – The idea that the Trump administration is “tough” or has taken “strong action” against Russia is repeated multiple times, such as: “my administration has taken a very firm stance – it’s a very firm stance – on a strong action. We’re going to take strong action…” and “the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being.”

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear by framing the political climate as a “cultural civil war in which the left sees itself losing,” implying a dangerous and desperate opposition.

Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on the motives of former intelligence officials like Brennan and Clapper, suggesting their criticism of Trump is merely “an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America” and is “driven by their own guilt.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes Trump’s Helsinki statements as a simple misspeaking of one word (“would” instead of “wouldn’t”), while exaggerating the weakness of the previous administration’s response as “weakness on a pathetic scale.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue around who “failed to protect America” and positioning the Trump administration as the one taking action to “secure our election systems.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “firestorm of controversy,” “Russian dictator,” “nastiness,” “hysteria of the left,” and “vicious comments” to influence the audience’s emotions.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with hated groups like Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue by stating that the Obama administration ignored Russian meddling simply “because they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win.” It also simplifies the motives of Trump’s critics to just “their own guilt.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its assertions and accusations; it does not use intentionally vague language to confuse.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The author, Newt Gingrich (a former Speaker of the House), presents himself as an authority. He quotes his own initial critical tweet (“It is the most serious mistake of his presidency…”) to establish credibility before defending the President.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a binary choice: the Trump administration is “far tougher on Russia,” while the Obama administration’s response was “weakness on a pathetic scale.” It leaves no room for nuance or a middle ground.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “Just keep that in mind the next time you see one of them on TV” serves to shut down critical thought by pre-emptively framing any future criticism from former officials as illegitimate and driven by guilt.

Red herring – Yes – The central topic is Trump’s controversial Helsinki summit, but the author quickly pivots to a detailed attack on the Obama administration’s past actions and the personal failings of Trump’s critics, distracting from the original issue.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the idea that the Trump administration is not firm with Russia by listing a series of actions. This sets up and knocks down the most extreme version of the criticism, ignoring more nuanced critiques that focus on the President’s rhetoric and personal deference to Putin versus his administration’s policies.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text is a prime example of this technique. When faced with criticism of President Trump’s actions, the author repeatedly deflects by asking what about the Obama administration’s failures: “the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump… are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016.”

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and powerful example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint by manipulating their emotions and perceptions. The piece employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal.

The entire structure of the argument is built upon the **Red Herring** and **Whataboutism** techniques. It acknowledges a controversial event (the Helsinki summit) but immediately pivots the focus onto the alleged failures of the previous administration and the supposed hypocrisy of President Trump's critics. This deflects from the initial issue and reframes the entire debate.

This reframing is accomplished using a **Black & White Fallacy**, where the Trump administration is presented as unequivocally "tough" and "strong" while the Obama administration was "pathetic" and weak. There is no room for complexity or nuance. The author uses **Causal Oversimplification** to assign simple, negative motives to Trump's opponents (they are motivated by "guilt" and a desire to "distract attention"), and **Doubt** to undermine their credibility.

The piece is saturated with **Loaded Language** ("hysteria," "vicious," "nastiness") and **Name Calling** ("Russian dictator," "radical-extremist wing") to create a strong emotional response. Finally, it uses **Appeal to Authority** (citing the author's own credentials and initial criticism) to build trust with the reader before launching into the defense. The sheer number and combination of these techniques, all working in concert to defend a political figure and attack his opponents, move the text from a simple opinion piece to a highly effective work of propaganda.
