1. Name calling – Yes – The text describes an opponent's action as "particularly stupid" and labels a group as "shameless Zionists."
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that comparing US immigration policy to the Holocaust is a "facile Nazi analogy" and is wrong is stated and reinforced multiple times throughout the text.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase "Children are being used as human shields in a campaign to end national security forever" is a brief, memorable, and emotionally charged phrase.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text claims that the alternative to its position is a desire for "open borders" which will "end national security forever," instilling fear about the consequences of the opposing viewpoint.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively works to question the credibility and intelligence of Michael Hayden ("particularly stupid," "thoughtless tweet") and the media ("2 very simple rules").
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the opposition's motive by claiming they want to "end national security forever." It also minimizes the act of family separation by equating it to what happens in any routine arrest ("Just about every country splits up families when they arrest the parents").
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national identity by framing the debate as a matter of defending "national security" and a country's right to "law enforcement."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical phrases like "shameless Zionists," "human shields," and "thoughtless tweet" to influence the audience's emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text is analyzing and critiquing the use of Hitler/Nazi analogies by others, not using such an analogy itself to discredit a separate idea.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text argues against a viewpoint it presents as popular in the media, rather than claiming its own position is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex motivations of those concerned about immigration policy to a single cause: "The attacks here are motivated by a desire for open borders."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and clear in its accusations and its argument, not deliberately vague.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does not use an authority figure to support its claims; instead, it attacks an authority figure (Michael Hayden) to discredit an opposing view.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: supporting its view of immigration enforcement or wanting "open borders" and to "end national security forever," ignoring all other possible nuanced positions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "That's the really relevant part" is used to shut down any further discussion of parallels by declaring that mass murder is the only point that matters, thus discouraging further critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the Muslim Brotherhood at the beginning. This serves to distract from the main argument about US immigration policy by shifting the focus to a different group where the author feels a Nazi comparison is more appropriate.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an exaggerated version of the opposing argument, implying critics believe immigration enforcement is identical to the Holocaust, including genocide ("then killed them all"). It also creates a straw man of the opposition's motive, claiming they want to "end national security forever."
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text attempts to discredit Michael Hayden by charging him with hypocrisy, pointing out that "during the Bush years, the agencies he ran were compared to Nazi Germany," implying he should not be making similar comparisons now.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast number of propaganda techniques not to foster a reasoned debate, but to discredit and attack an opposing viewpoint. The core of the text's strategy is to reframe the argument from a debate about the morality of an immigration policy to a defense of national security against those who wish to destroy it. It achieves this through numerous fallacies and manipulative tactics. It uses a Straw Man argument by misrepresenting the comparison to the Holocaust as a claim of identicality (including genocide) and then easily refuting it. It employs Causal Oversimplification and the Black & White Fallacy to paint opponents as having a single, sinister motive ("a desire for open borders") with a catastrophic goal ("end national security forever"), which is a clear Appeal to Fear. The language is heavily loaded with emotional and insulting terms ("shameless Zionists," "particularly stupid," "human shields") designed to provoke an emotional response rather than a logical one. While the text makes a factual point (the Holocaust involved genocide, which the policy in question does not), this point is embedded within a framework of propaganda that aims to shut down conversation and vilify the opposition.
