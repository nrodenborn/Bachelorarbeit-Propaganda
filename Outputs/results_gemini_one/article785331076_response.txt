Name calling – Yes – The text uses the term "blue privilege" to label the perceived special treatment given to the police officer, framing it as a form of corruption.

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times in a row. Additionally, the core message that the officer was "not arrested" is stated in the headline and repeated multiple times throughout the article to emphasize the point of injustice.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text aims to instill fear of the police by highlighting a "super scary" incident where an officer kills an innocent person in their own home, suggesting this is a dangerous reality for citizens. Example: “Super scary because the police are supposed to protect you and then they come home and, you know, you’re just hanging out in your own house and then they come home thinking they’re home or whatever.”

Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the fairness and credibility of the justice system by contrasting the officer's treatment with how an "average citizen" would be treated, implying the official process is corrupt. Example: "If an average citizen walked into the wrong home and shot and killed an innocent homeowner, rest assured that they would be in jail—right now."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses hyperbole to amplify the situation. Example: "Highlighting the sheer insane state of law enforcement in America today is a tragic story out of Dallas this week."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its point.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases designed to provoke outrage and sympathy. Examples include "sheer insane state," "tragic story," "innocent homeowner," and "a slap to the face of Jean’s parents."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or group to the Nazis or other universally hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest the reader should agree with its position because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text implies the sole reason the officer has not been arrested is "blue privilege," which is a simple explanation for a complex situation involving legal investigation procedures. Example: "However, instead of immediately arresting the officer for trespassing and murder, she was simply placed on administrative leave—a glaring function of blue privilege indeed."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and clear in its accusations and point of view; it does not use vague language to confuse the audience.

Appeal to authority – No – While the text quotes sources, it does not use the support of an authority figure as the primary evidence for its main argument about police privilege.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: the way the officer was treated versus how an "average citizen" would be treated, ignoring any other nuances or procedures in the legal system. Example: "If an average citizen walked into the wrong home and shot and killed an innocent homeowner, rest assured that they would be in jail—right now."

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to discourage critical thought; on the contrary, it aims to provoke it.

Red herring – Yes – The poll asking "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is completely irrelevant to the story about the shooting and serves as a distraction, likely for the purpose of data collection.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that was not presented by an opponent; it focuses on making its own case.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. While it is based on a real and tragic event, its primary purpose is not to objectively inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly critical viewpoint of law enforcement. It achieves this by employing a multitude of propaganda techniques. The article uses heavily loaded and emotional language ("sheer insane," "slap in the face") and exaggeration to frame the narrative from the outset. It creates a simple, emotionally resonant conflict using a black & white fallacy (the privileged officer vs. the "average citizen") and assigns a simple cause ("blue privilege") to a complex legal situation, which is a form of causal oversimplification. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant political poll serves as a red herring, indicating that the publisher's goals extend beyond journalism into areas like data collection. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and opinions rather than to present a balanced account of the event.
