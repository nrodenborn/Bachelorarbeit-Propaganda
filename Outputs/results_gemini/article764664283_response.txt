1. Name calling – Yes – The text’s title refers to Garry Wills as a “Foolish Religion Author,” and later describes his views as “naïve” and associates him with the pejoratively used label “Leftist Catholic.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly insists that Garry Wills is unreliable because he ignores or omits information. Phrases such as “Wills never mentions,” “Wills doesn’t mention,” “Wills has omitted,” and “it turns out that Wills has ignored key passages” are used throughout the article to hammer home this single point.

3. Slogans – No – The text is a detailed, argumentative piece and does not use brief, memorable phrases meant for mass repetition.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text links the interpretation of the Qur'an that it advocates for with the actions of ISIS, listing numerous violent acts and quoting verses about killing, subjugation, and amputation to instill fear about the consequences of accepting Wills' "peaceful" interpretation.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to cast doubt on Garry Wills’ credibility. Statements like “That would be good to know, were Wills a reliable witness,” “Unfortunately, he proves to be just the opposite,” and “His manifest unreliability on this point casts a shadow on his primary assertions” are central to the text's argument.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author accuses Wills of minimization by claiming he is determined to “put the best possible face on the Qur’an.” The author also uses exaggeration, for instance, in the question “why do so very many Muslims worldwide misunderstand it?” which exaggerates the number of Muslims who subscribe to a violent interpretation to make a rhetorical point.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – While not appealing to a specific nation, the text appeals to the identity of a non-Muslim, Western audience presumed to be concerned about “Islamic terrorism.” It creates an “us” (the readers, the author) versus “them” (Wills, the “Leftist establishment,” violent extremists) dynamic, which is a form of identity-based appeal.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to influence the reader, such as “Foolish,” “legerdemain” (trickery), “incitement and hatred,” “peaceful fantasy Qur’an,” “head-in-the-sand posture,” and “preposterously.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of Wills' ideas by associating them with groups the intended audience is expected to dislike, namely the “Leftist Catholic” Pope Francis and the “Catholic and Leftist establishment.” This tactic aims to discredit Wills' argument by linking it to a disliked political/ideological group.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The author uses a form of this technique by asking why “so very many Muslims worldwide misunderstand” the Qur’an if it is peaceful. This implies that a large number of people (a bandwagon) agree with the author’s interpretation, lending it popular validation.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for the complex phenomenon of Islamic terrorism: the text of the Qur’an. By extensively linking ISIS's actions directly to Qur'anic verses, it ignores the complex political, social, and economic factors that contribute to the rise of such groups.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s argument is direct, clear, and confrontational. He accuses his opponent of using unclear expressions (“legerdemain,” adding bracketed words) but his own style is not intentionally vague.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author dismisses the authority of Garry Wills and Pope Francis but establishes his own (“Robert Spencer of Jihad Watch”) and introduces another authority to support his case: “The prominent Twentieth Century Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri.” He also ironically uses ISIS as an authority on the "correct" interpretation of the Qur'an.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the interpretation of the Qur’an as a binary choice: it is either the “naïve, inaccurate, misleadingly sunny view” of Garry Wills, or it is the violent, intolerant text that the author claims it to be. This framing ignores the possibility of diverse, nuanced, or contextual interpretations.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text is a long-form argument that seeks to guide critical thought in a specific direction rather than shut it down with simple, generic phrases.

16. Red herring – Yes – The poll inserted in the middle of the article (“Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?”) is completely irrelevant to the discussion of the Qur’an. It serves to distract the reader and reinforce a political alignment unrelated to the text's main argument.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes a simplified and uncharitable version of his opponent's argument. He boils down Wills' entire book to a “peaceful fantasy Qur’an” and the idea that it is “fraternal in its treatment of other faiths,” making this simplified position easier to attack with contrary verses.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The author explicitly accuses Garry Wills of using this technique, noting that Wills engages in “tu quoque arguments” and brings up the Bible to argue that it “contains material that is just as bad or worse” as a way to deflect criticism from the Qur'an.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary goal is not to engage in a balanced, scholarly review of Garry Wills' book, but to persuade the reader to reject Wills and his arguments entirely by discrediting him personally and presenting a one-sided, emotionally charged case. The text employs a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques. It systematically attacks the author's character (Name-calling, Doubt), frames the argument in simplistic and fearful terms (Appeal to Fear, Black & White Fallacy, Causal Oversimplification), uses manipulative language and evidence (Loaded Language, Repetition, Appeal to Authority), and appeals to the presumed biases of its audience (Flag-Waving, Reduction ad Hitlerum). The inclusion of a completely irrelevant political poll (Red Herring) further demonstrates that the article's purpose is persuasion and ideological reinforcement rather than objective analysis.
