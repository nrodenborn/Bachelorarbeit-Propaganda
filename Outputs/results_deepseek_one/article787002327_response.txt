### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling – Yes**  
   Explanation: "Unholy Alliance masters" (referring to Facebook), "fascistic manner", "leftist brownshirt-style assault", and "Stalinist Left" are insulting labels attacking opponents.  

2. **Repetition – Yes**  
   Explanation: The theme of "leftist totalitarianism" and censorship against conservatives is repeated throughout (e.g., "totalitarian attack on free speech," "leftist totalitarians," "assault on free speech").  

3. **Slogans – No**  
   Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL") are used. Phrases like "battle for America" are descriptive but not slogan-like.  

4. **Appeal to fear – Yes**  
   Explanation: Warns of a "totalitarian attack on free speech," "suffocate dissent," and the "war on America," instilling fear about leftist suppression of conservatives.  

5. **Doubt – Yes**  
   Explanation: Questions Facebook’s credibility by insisting the ban reversal was not a "mistake" but due to publicity, casting doubt on their integrity.  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes**  
   Explanation: Exaggerates Facebook’s actions as "tyrannical," "fascistic," and part of a "Stalinist war," while minimizing their content moderation as purely ideological.  

7. **Flag-Waving – Yes**  
   Explanation: Appeals to patriotism with references to "free speech," "liberties," "defend America," and "battle for the West."  

8. **Loaded Language – Yes**  
   Explanation: Uses emotionally charged terms like "tyrannical," "venomous," "Orwellian," "vicious lie," and "pernicious assault" to evoke outrage.  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes**  
   Explanation: Compares opponents to fascists ("brownshirt-style"), Stalinists, and Vichy collaborators ("Unholy Alliance masters").  

10. **Bandwagon – No**  
    Explanation: No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone supports this"). Mentions allies (e.g., Breitbart) but not to argue popularity.  

11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes**  
    Explanation: Attributes complex content moderation solely to political bias (e.g., "leftist totalitarians" censoring conservatives), ignoring other factors.  

12. **Obfuscation – No**  
    Explanation: Arguments are direct, not deliberately vague. Claims are inflammatory but clear.  

13. **Appeal to authority – Yes**  
    Explanation: Cites "brave conservative figures" (e.g., Michelle Malkin) and groups (e.g., Prager U) to validate their narrative.  

14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes**  
    Explanation: Frames issues as binary: "conservative truth-tellers" vs. "leftist totalitarians," with no middle ground.  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes**  
    Explanation: Uses phrases like "free speech victory," "Orwellian," and "Stalinist Left" to shut down critical analysis.  

16. **Red herring – No**  
    Explanation: No irrelevant distractions; the focus remains on alleged censorship.  

17. **Straw men – No**  
    Explanation: Does not misrepresent opposing arguments; criticizes specific actions (e.g., bans) without distortion.  

18. **Whataboutism – No**  
    Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., "What about the Left’s actions?"). Focuses on direct criticism.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to pervasive use of manipulative techniques. It employs **name-calling** (e.g., "Stalinist Left"), **fear appeals** (imminent loss of free speech), **loaded language** (e.g., "venomous," "brownshirt-style"), and **false dichotomies** (conservatives vs. totalitarians) to frame a one-sided narrative. It exaggerates threats (e.g., equating Facebook moderation to fascism) while dismissing counter-evidence (e.g., rejecting Facebook’s "mistake" claim). The goal is to mobilize readers against a perceived ideological enemy, not to inform neutrally. References to partisan authorities (e.g., Breitbart) and historical atrocities (Stalin, Nazis) further signal propaganda. While based on real events (Glazov’s ban), the text’s selective framing, emotional manipulation, and lack of balanced context confirm its propagandistic intent. The 5% uncertainty stems from factual elements (e.g., the ban reversal), but these are weaponized to advance an agenda.
