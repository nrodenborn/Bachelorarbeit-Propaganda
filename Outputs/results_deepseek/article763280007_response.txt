Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "political elites" (used pejoratively), "authoritarian" (describing the government), "appeasement-minded government".
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – "No more!" (repeated), "Take notice" (repeated to multiple leaders).
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – "No more!", "Enough is enough", "We are the people", "We will not be silenced", "We will never surrender".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "We are almost foreigners in our own lands", "death of Britain as a free society", "beginning of an authoritarian police state", "sacrifice of thousands of British girls".
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "Apparently British authorities decided that it would be too politically costly for them to bar Wilders again" (implies their motives are political, not principled), "Theresa May and company obvious hope... other Britons... will... be frightened into silence" (assigns unproven motive).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "massive, years-long cover-up" (exaggeration of government intent/action), "death of Britain as a free society" (exaggerated consequence), "for the crime of opposing jihad terror and Sharia oppression" (minimizes/oversimplifies the stated reasons for bans).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "We will defend our civilization", "And we will protect our people", "We are the people", "defend our civilization".
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "sold us out", "tyranny", "jihad terror", "Sharia oppression", "authoritarian", "rape gangs", "cover-up", "sacrifice", "idols of 'diversity' and 'multiculturalism'", "incarcerate", "degeneration", "police state", "totalitarianism".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No direct comparison to Hitler or Nazis is made. While criticizing Islamization and jihad, it doesn't explicitly link opponents to universally despised groups *in that specific way*.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "20,000 people came out", "for every Tommy whom you imprison, thousands will rise up", "We are the people", "the future is ours".
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributing complex societal changes solely to "mass immigration... Islamization... open borders". Attributing bans solely to "opposing jihad terror and Sharia oppression" or "telling the truth about Islam and jihad".
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is highly polemical but generally uses direct, clear language to make its points. Terms like "Islamization" or "our civilization" are broad but used consistently within the author's ideological framework, not obfuscated.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While Wilders is presented as a speaker, the text doesn't rely on citing external authorities or experts for validation. It relies on Wilders' statements and the author's own assertions.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – "British public figures... should be calling for him to be freed today, or else they will be exposing themselves as supporting the degeneration of Britain into a police state." (Presents only two options: support freeing Robinson or support a police state).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "death of Britain as a free society", "authoritarian police state", "death of free societies", "sacrifice of thousands of British girls to the idols of 'diversity' and 'multiculturalism'". These phrases shut down nuanced discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text focuses heavily on criticizing government immigration policy, treatment of critics, and bans, using examples consistently within that theme. While the examples about admitted preachers are used to contrast with bans, they relate directly to the core accusation of hypocrisy and appeasement.
17. **Straw men** – Yes – "for the crime of opposing jihad terror and Sharia oppression" (This misrepresents the stated legal or administrative reasons given by the government for the bans, which were likely based on potential for hate speech or public order offenses, not opposition to terror/oppression itself). Also, "Theresa May and company obvious hope... other Britons... will... be frightened into silence" (Asserts a motive not proven).
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Extensively used by contrasting the bans of Robinson, Wilders (previously), Sellner, Pettibone, Southern, Bachmann, Geller, and Spencer with the admission of figures like Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri, Shaykh Hamza Sodagar, and others praised for violence, to charge the government with hypocrisy. "Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers... Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops..."

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a very high concentration of recognized propaganda techniques. It relies heavily on **Loaded Language**, **Appeal to Fear**, **Exaggeration**, **Bandwagon**, **Name Calling**, **Slogans**, **Repetition**, **Causal Oversimplification**, **Whataboutism**, **Black & White Fallacy**, **Thought-Terminating Clichés**, and **Straw Men**. Its primary purpose is not to present a balanced or nuanced analysis of complex immigration, free speech, and security issues, but to vigorously advocate a specific, highly critical perspective by demonizing opponents ("elites", "authoritarian" government), invoking fear of cultural displacement and tyranny, oversimplifying causes, using emotionally charged language, and rallying the audience against the perceived enemy. While it cites specific events (rallies, bans, preacher statements), these are selected and framed entirely to support its polemical narrative, characteristic of propaganda.
