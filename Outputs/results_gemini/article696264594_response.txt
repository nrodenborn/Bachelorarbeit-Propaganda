1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Jewish Voice for Peace as an “anti-Israel BDS hate group” and its members and partners as “anti-Israel activists” and “anti-Israel leftists”.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly states that the American Jewish Historical Society (AJHS) is partnering with Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), often reinforcing the negative label, such as in the phrases “partnering with Jewish Voice for Peace: an anti-Israel BDS hate group” and “AJHS partnership with JVP”.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, impactful phrases to frame the conflict, such as the concluding choice: “Either you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews.”
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text links the actions of the AJHS to existential threats, stating that their partners defend Hamas and that the choice is between standing with them or with Jews, and invokes the memory of Nazi Germany to create fear about the consequences of inaction.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text systematically questions the credibility and mission of the American Jewish Historical Society, stating, “The American Jewish Historical Society was founded to study and preserve Jewish history. These days it’s instead partnering with Jewish Voice for Peace”.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The title itself, “The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event,” is an exaggeration of the event's actual title, which is presented later as “The Balfour Declaration: Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State?”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to Jewish identity and pro-Israel patriotism, for example by invoking the name of “Emma Lazarus, named after a passionate Zionist” and framing the conflict as a choice to “stand with… Jews.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as “hate group,” “blood libels,” “perversion,” “corruption,” and “tragic” to evoke strong negative feelings towards the subjects.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text makes a direct comparison to the rise of Nazism: “When we think about Nazi Germany, we remember those who spoke out. We don’t remember those who were too intimidated and uncertain to rise against anti-Semitism when they saw it and heard it.”
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is popular. In fact, it suggests the opposite, framing speaking out as a difficult path: “Opposing the anti-Israel left makes many important enemies and wins few friends.”
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex programming and leadership decisions at the AJHS and CJH to a single, simple cause: the infiltration and “perversion by the radical anti-Jewish and anti-Israel left.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and specific in its accusations, naming individuals, organizations, and events. It is not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does not cite external authorities to support its own claims. Instead, it attacks the authority of the figures and institutions it criticizes.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark false dichotomy: “Either you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like “the choice becomes easy” and “such choices will become even more obscenely simple” to discourage nuanced consideration of the issue.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text brings up the controversy over David N. Myers’s appointment to head the Center for Jewish History, which, while related, distracts from the specific AJHS-JVP events to build a broader case about the institution's leadership.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text anticipates and refutes a potential defense by the AJHS: “AJHS will claim that it is only offering different perspectives. But when it comes to Israel, there’s only one perspective.” This misrepresents the opposing viewpoint as having only one simplistic defense and then dismisses it.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges the AJHS with hypocrisy by contrasting its current actions with its historical identity: “An organization that hands out the Emma Lazarus Award, named after a passionate Zionist, at its posh dinners is hosting attacks on the existence of Israel.”

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. While it is based on factual occurrences (the existence of the organizations and the scheduling of the events), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade through a relentless and overwhelming application of propaganda techniques. The author employs a vast majority of the listed techniques, including name-calling (“hate group”), loaded language (“perversion,” “blood libels”), appeal to fear (invoking Hamas and Nazi Germany), and a stark black & white fallacy (“Either you stand with... or with Jews”). The narrative is built on causal oversimplification (a “radical left” takeover) and systematically works to discredit the target organizations. The consistent use of these methods demonstrates an intent to manipulate the reader's emotions, shut down critical thought, and frame a complex political disagreement as a simple moral battle, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
