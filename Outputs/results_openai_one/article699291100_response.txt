**Verdict – 90% –**  
This text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs multiple propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, obfuscation, appeal to authority, red herring, and whataboutism. The narrative is constructed to cast suspicion on the Obama administration and the Clintons, using emotionally charged language and vague allegations to suggest corruption and cover-up without providing concrete evidence. The text also distracts from the main issue by referencing unrelated topics (CNN and Facebook ads), further indicating manipulative intent. The prevalence and variety of propaganda techniques used strongly suggest that the primary purpose of the text is to persuade the audience to adopt a particular viewpoint rather than to objectively inform.
