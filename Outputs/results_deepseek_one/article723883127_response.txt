### Verdict – 90% – Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda**. It employs at least 12/18 identified techniques (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, bandwagon, black/white fallacy) to manipulate emotions and discredit the Pope. Key indicators include:  
- **Sensationalism**: Hyperbolic language ("Shock!", "openly attacking") and repetition amplify outrage.  
- **Selective framing**: Omits context for the Pope’s "calumny" remark (e.g., his request for proof about Barros) while emphasizing victim testimony.  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded terms ("slander," "disgust") paint the Pope as an aggressor against victims.  
- **Oversimplification**: Reduces systemic abuse issues to the Pope’s personal failure.  
Though based on real events (e.g., Karadima case, Francis’ comments), the text’s one-sided narrative, omission of counter-evidence (e.g., later papal apologies), and reliance on emotional persuasion align with propaganda objectives. The 10% uncertainty stems from factual reporting of quotes and court findings, but these are weaponized to serve a biased agenda.
