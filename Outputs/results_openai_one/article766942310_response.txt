**Verdict – 60% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, such as name calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, and loaded language. These elements suggest a biased perspective, aiming to influence the reader's perception of the Trump-Kim summit negatively. However, it also provides some factual information and analysis, which tempers the overall propagandistic nature of the text. Therefore, while it contains propaganda elements, it is not entirely propaganda.**
