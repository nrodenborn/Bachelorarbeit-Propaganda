Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Trump and his White House are a gang that can't shoot straight" (insulting label).
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: No single specific message or phrase is repeated obsessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: The text uses descriptive language and analysis, not brief, memorable phrases designed as slogans.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – Explanation: The text warns of negative *consequences* (e.g., loss of trust, political damage), but it doesn't primarily use fear *against alternatives* to support a specific idea. It critiques the chosen path.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: "We don’t know to what extent Kavanaugh was Trump’s choice and to what extent he was manipulated into choosing him"; "the more it appears that Trump and his White House staff failed to do their jobs" (questioning Trump's competence/independence).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: "managed to make a complete hash of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination" (arguably exaggerates the failure); "Trump is hurting himself right now, and will have hurt himself more" (minimizes potential positive outcomes or nuances).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not appeal to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty to support its argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: "complete hash", "extremely high-profile episode", "erratic", "slur", "ugly ways", "botched nomination", "gang that can’t shoot straight" (emotionally charged, negative language).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Hitler or universally hated groups are made to disapprove of an idea.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The argument is not based on the popularity of the idea being presented (criticism of Trump's handling). It uses reasoning and evidence.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Places significant blame for the nomination troubles on Trump's choices and management ("he has managed to make a complete hash"), potentially oversimplifying a complex political situation involving many actors (Senate Republicans, Democrats, accusers, outside groups).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is generally clear and direct in its criticisms and analysis. Phrases like "good fit for Trump’s biases" or "cut-of-his-jib test" are explained contextually.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: "As the political scientist Richard Neustadt said, political elites are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating the president" (using an authority's statement to support the point about reputation damage).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: The text acknowledges complexities, alternatives ("conservative with similar views but a different background", "safer, but still very conservative, other option"), and nuances (e.g., acknowledging some coalition-building success).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: The text uses extended arguments and analysis, not phrases designed to shut down critical thought. It invites consideration of its points.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: All points raised relate directly to the Kavanaugh nomination process, Trump's handling of it, and the potential consequences. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text critiques actions and decisions actually described (Trump's outsourcing, choice of Kavanaugh, handling of accusations, erratic statements). It doesn't refute a misrepresented or non-existent argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text focuses criticism on Trump and his administration's actions regarding the Kavanaugh nomination. It does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy to deflect from this criticism.

**Verdict – 40% – Explanation:** The text exhibits several propaganda techniques (Name-calling, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority), demonstrating a clear persuasive and critical intent. The heavy use of loaded language and negative framing strongly pushes a specific viewpoint (that Trump mishandled the nomination). However, it avoids many core manipulative techniques like Repetition, Slogans, Fear Appeals, Bandwagon, Black/White Fallacy, and Whataboutism. It presents arguments, acknowledges some complexity and counterpoints (e.g., initial coalition-building success, the existence of other conservative judges), and uses reasoning alongside its persuasive elements. While heavily opinionated and critical, it retains elements of political analysis and argumentation beyond pure propaganda, preventing a higher percentage. It aims to persuade through critique and analysis infused with persuasive language rather than relying solely on manipulative tricks.
