**Verdict – 40% – Explanation**: The text contains several elements typical of propaganda, such as appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, and black & white fallacy. These techniques suggest an intention to influence the reader's perception of the situation negatively. However, the text also provides detailed information and context, which could be interpreted as an attempt to inform rather than solely manipulate. Therefore, while there are propaganda elements present, the text is not overwhelmingly propagandistic, leading to a moderate likelihood of 40%.
