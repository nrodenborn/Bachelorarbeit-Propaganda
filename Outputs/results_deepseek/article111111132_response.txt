Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **No** – No insulting labels are used to attack the subject (the Bible class program or its opponents). Critics describe the program as "unconstitutional" or based on a "foundation of lies," but these are legal/descriptive terms, not inherently insulting labels directed *at people*.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – While the phrase "Bible in the Schools" is repeated as the program name, there is no single core message (e.g., "This program is unconstitutional" or "This program is vital") being repeated over and over to hammer it home.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – The billboard message: "If you die tonight. Heaven or Hell?" is a brief, memorable phrase designed to provoke thought/emotion.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The anecdote about Elizabeth Deal's daughter being told by other students that "she was going to hell" for not attending the class uses the fear of damnation and social ostracization to argue against the program.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Supporters (like the Tollivers and Rev. Hurt) cast doubt on the necessity or validity of the lawsuit ("I don’t know who it harms", "I don't see any problem"). Critics (like Lynne White and Charles Haynes) cast doubt on the program's claimed secular/academic nature ("spreading what she says is a false sense", "This is a loser for the school district").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – *Minimization*: Supporters repeatedly downplay the religious nature and impact of the program ("not teaching religion", "teaches character", "explore the history and literature", "not to promote religious belief", "the kids aren’t forced"). *Exaggeration*: The description of the impact on Deal's daughter (bullying, taunting, being told she's going to hell) highlights negative consequences.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While the context is local (Mercer County), there is no explicit appeal to patriotism (American or West Virginian) or a broad group identity to support the program. The appeals are more to community tradition and perceived benefits.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Words/phrases like "adamant," "ostracized," "wrong," "stand up against it," "God is a big deal," "stern messages," "eternal salvation," "irrefutable lessons," "foundation of lies," "worldly views," "unconstitutional at its core," "loser for the school district" carry strong emotional connotations (positive or negative) beyond their literal meaning.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No attempt is made to link the opponents or the program to universally hated groups (like Nazis).
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Supporters emphasize the program's popularity: "almost every child in the district attends," "widespread support," "raised nearly $500,000 a year," "If it were simply a popularity contest, Bible in the Schools would be allowed to continue." This implies readers should support it because it's popular.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The arguments presented (both for and against) acknowledge complexity (constitutional law, community impact, religious freedom vs. establishment). No single, simple cause is presented for a complex issue.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Supporters describe the class as exploring "the history and literature of the Bible" and teaching "character and respect," but the examples given in the lawsuit (treating stories as historical fact, advocating the Ten Commandments, imagining Adam riding dinosaurs) and the quotes from lessons suggest a religious perspective, creating ambiguity about its true nature. The district declining to let the class be observed adds to the vagueness.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The Rev. David W. Dockery, Rev. Ray Hurt (and his son on the school board), Charles C. Haynes (Religious Freedom Center), and lawyers (Hiram Sasser, Patrick Elliott) are cited to lend credibility to their respective sides' arguments.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Elizabeth Deal frames her motivation: "When something is wrong, you have to stand up against it." This presents the issue as simply "wrong" vs. not standing up, ignoring nuance. Patrick Elliott states the program "is unconstitutional at its core and cannot be saved via modifications," presenting only two options: complete removal or unconstitutional program.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Rev. Dockery: "Any time God’s word can be proclaimed is beneficial and is a good thing." Rev. Hurt: "It speaks for itself in terms of morals and ethics." These phrases shut down critical examination of *how* the word is proclaimed or *what specific morals* are being taught in this context. The Facebook comment to Lynne White ("I will pray for you...") also functions this way, dismissing her argument based on faith.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – While arguments are made, the text doesn't introduce obviously irrelevant material to distract from the core issue (the constitutionality of the Bible class program during school hours).
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The arguments presented by each side (supporters: it's academic/beneficial/voluntary; opponents: it's religious/coercive/unconstitutional) address the actual positions held, as described in the text. No significant misrepresentation of the opposing argument is evident.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Charles Haynes uses a form of it: "They would rightly object... if they lived somewhere where they were the religious minority and supporters of another religion wanted a course on their faith taught in public schools." This charges the supporters (implicitly) with hypocrisy by suggesting they wouldn't accept a similar program for a different faith.

**Verdict – 40% –** The text presents a news report covering both sides of a controversial issue. While it includes numerous examples of propaganda techniques employed *by the people quoted within the story* (supporters and opponents of the Bible class program), the overall text itself functions more as reporting than pure propaganda. It provides context, quotes from multiple perspectives (pro, con, neutral legal), and factual background. The presence of loaded language and selective emphasis (e.g., focusing on the child's positive experience and the bullying anecdote) shows a subtle bias likely favoring the program's continuation, but it stops short of being overtly one-sided propaganda. It aims to inform about the conflict rather than solely persuade the reader to one viewpoint using the full arsenal of techniques indiscriminately. The significant percentage reflects the high density of propaganda techniques *used by the subjects* of the article within the text.
