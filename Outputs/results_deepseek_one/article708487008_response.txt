Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to subjects (e.g., plague is described neutrally as "impossible to eradicate," not labeled with inflammatory terms).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No key phrases or messages are repeated excessively; the text progresses factually.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, rallying phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL!") appear.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text emphasizes dire consequences (e.g., *"the airborne version of the plague can kill a person in just three hours"*) to underscore urgency, potentially instilling fear.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility (e.g., WHO or experts are cited without skepticism).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Statistics (e.g., 2119 cases, 171 deaths) and expert claims (e.g., "impossible to eradicate") are presented as factual, not exaggerated/minimized.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism, identity, or collective action (e.g., "we the people").  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Terms like *"black death"* (historical synonym for plague) and *"impossible to eradicate"* evoke dread, leveraging emotional weight beyond clinical description.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Complexity is acknowledged (e.g., *"requires a better understanding of transmission pathways"*), rejecting simple causes.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are specific (e.g., case numbers, transmission methods, expert names).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Dr. Cheng’s expertise is cited (*"Professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology"*) to validate claims, e.g., *"It’s not possible to eradicate plague"*.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dilemmas (e.g., "only two solutions exist"); multiple approaches (reactive/preventative) are discussed.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases shutting down debate (e.g., "it is what it is").  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions; focus remains on plague risks/management.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy.  

---

**Verdict – 15% –** The text is **primarily informational**, citing experts (e.g., Dr. Cheng), WHO data, and factual details (case numbers, transmission sources) to raise awareness about plague risks in Madagascar. However, minor propagandistic elements exist:  
- **Appeal to fear** (highlighting rapid lethality) and **loaded language** (using "black death") may subtly amplify emotional response.  
- **Appeal to authority** lends credibility but does not distort facts.  
These are outweighed by the objective reporting of statistics, expert recommendations, and contextual nuances (e.g., wildlife reservoirs, regional challenges). The tone is cautionary rather than manipulative, aiming to inform public health preparedness, not advance a hidden agenda.
