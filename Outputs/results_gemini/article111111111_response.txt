Verdict – 5% – While the text uses techniques like Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language, and Appeal to Authority, it is highly unlikely to be propaganda. The context is a public health announcement from a credible global health organization (WHO). In this context, appealing to a relevant authority (the WHO Director-General) is standard journalistic practice. Likewise, using loaded language ("deadly," "dangerous") and appealing to fear (warning of a stronger future outbreak) are appropriate and necessary communication strategies to convey the seriousness of a real public health threat and encourage preventative action. The intent is not to deceive or promote a political ideology, but to inform and warn for the public good, which separates it from propaganda.
