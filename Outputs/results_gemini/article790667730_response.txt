1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Senator Graham calling the hearing a "most unethical sham," which is an insulting label for the political process.

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times in a row.

3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase "most unethical sham" is used as a brief, memorable, and impactful phrase that is even featured in the headline.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Senator Graham's quote, "Boy, y'all want power. Boy, I hope you never get it," is used to instill fear or concern in the reader about the prospect of Democrats gaining political power.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on Dr. Ford's credibility by stating that Democrats believe her "without any evidence" and that "all of the evidence and all of the witnesses to date... refute her claims."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline's use of "Unleashes Firestorm" is an exaggeration. Graham's claim that the Democrats' goal is to "destroy this guy's life" is also an example of exaggeration.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The quote, "I hope the American people can see through this sham," is an appeal to a collective national identity ("the American people") to unify against the opposition.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like "firestorm," "berated," "relentless assault," "blasted," and "sham" to influence the reader's emotions.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by suggesting it is popular with hated groups like Nazis.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The author claims Graham "said what many of us thought should have been said" and "what everyone had been waiting on," suggesting that this is a popular opinion that the reader should also adopt.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simplified reason for the Democrats' actions, quoting Graham: "What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020." This reduces a complex political situation to a single, malicious motive.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and clear in its accusations and point of view; it does not use vague or obscure language to confuse the audience.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The entire article uses Senator Lindsey Graham, a person in a position of authority, and his emotional testimony as the primary evidence for its argument.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The narrative presents only two options: either you support Kavanaugh and see the process as a "sham," or you are part of the Democrats' "relentless assault." It leaves no room for nuance or other perspectives.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "Boy, y'all want power" serves to shut down nuanced discussion by attributing a simple, cynical motive to the opposition, discouraging critical thought about their stated reasons.

16. Red herring – Yes – The repeated poll about Nikki Haley's replacement is completely irrelevant to the article's subject (the Kavanaugh hearing) and serves to distract the reader.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the idea that Dr. Ford should be believed "without any evidence," misrepresenting the Democrats' argument which was that her testimony was credible and warranted a full investigation, not that it was absolute proof in itself.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text directly attacks the Democrats' actions in this specific case but does not deflect criticism by accusing them of hypocrisy with a "what about..." statement.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to objectively inform the reader about the events of the hearing, but to persuade them to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint. This is achieved through the heavy and combined use of a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques. The article employs loaded language ("firestorm," "relentless assault") and exaggeration to create an emotional atmosphere. It then uses logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy, causal oversimplification, and a straw man argument to frame the Democrats as purely malicious actors. It appeals to the bandwagon effect ("what everyone had been waiting on") and authority (Senator Graham) to validate its position, while simultaneously using techniques like name-calling ("unethical sham") and appeal to fear ("I hope you never get it") to attack the opposition. The inclusion of a distracting red herring (the poll) further underscores that the article's goal is persuasion and engagement for a specific political cause, rather than journalistic reporting.
