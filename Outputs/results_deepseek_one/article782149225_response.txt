Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "filthy Jewish entity". This is an insulting label used to attack Israel/Jews.
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" repeated three times consecutively in the poll.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "Allahu akbar" (used by the audience) serves as a brief, memorable rallying cry.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – The core message instills fear of Muslim conquest ("conquest of America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy", "relentless jihad warfare", "subjugating them", "danger to Western nations"). Statements like "a dark, impenetrable and 'irreversible' winter..." also evoke fear.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "if they have taken any notice of him at all, which is unlikely, they have dismissed him as an ‘extremist.’" Questions the awareness and seriousness of authorities. Also, "But no one will take any particular notice of this." questions societal awareness.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – *Exaggeration:* Portraying the desire for global caliphate and jihad conquest as universal, mainstream, and historically constant ("mainstream, normative Islam", "for fourteen centuries", "in every age and in every place", "never appears any force of Muslims to oppose them", "never been... an Islamic entity... opposed to waging jihad"). *Minimization:* Downplaying opposition ("Islamic groups in the West issue pro-forma condemnations... but are doing little or nothing").
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Implied defense of Western nations (America, Britain, Russia, France, Italy) against perceived external (Islamic) threats. The focus on conquest *of* these nations appeals to their national identities/patriotism.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Numerous emotionally charged terms: "delighted screams", "heretic regimes", "filthy Jewish entity", "deluded fanatic", "jihadis", "subjugating", "relentless jihad warfare", "hijacking", "distressingly widespread", "extremism".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – While historical caliphates are mentioned negatively, they are not explicitly compared to Nazis or Hitler. The Vichy analogy isn't used here.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea to persuade the audience to join it. The focus is on the claimed prevalence of the *opposing* ideology (jihadism).
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Attributes the perceived need for conquest and jihad primarily/simplistically to the abandonment of Islamic law ("After the laws of Allah were abandoned... the most important thing to do is to restore the rule..."). Ignores complex geopolitical, economic, and social factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes** – "heretic regimes", "renew Islamic life", "deliver the Islamic message", "the implication of this today", "lands under direct colonization, like Kashmir and others" are vague. The claim that opposition to jihad has *never* existed in Islamic history is a broad, unsubstantiated, and vague assertion.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Cites MEMRI as the source for Khecharem's quotes. Cites the author's own book ("As I show in my book The History of Jihad...") as authoritative evidence for historical claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents the situation as Muslims either supporting jihad conquest or opposing it, with no meaningful middle ground or nuance implied ("there never appears any force of Muslims to oppose them", "there has never been... an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Phrases like "mainstream, normative Islam", "for fourteen centuries", "never been", "so it is today" are used to shut down critical examination of the historical and contemporary claims about the universality of jihad ideology among Muslims.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – The entire poll about Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation ("Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" repeated 3 times and the options) is completely irrelevant to the main topic of the Muslim leader's speech and the article's commentary on jihad. It distracts the reader.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – "If Said Khecharem were a non-Muslim saying that Muslims needed to destroy ‘the filthy Jewish entity’ and conquer America... he would be accused of ‘Islamophobia’ and ‘bigotry.’" This misrepresents the *reason* for accusations of Islamophobia (which typically address prejudice against *Muslims*, not criticism of extremist statements) and sets up a false equivalence/double standard argument. Also, characterizing Islamic condemnations as merely "pro-forma" dismisses potential genuine opposition without evidence.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – While the text mentions a perceived double standard, it doesn't primarily charge an *opponent* with hypocrisy *as a way to deflect criticism*. The focus is on the perceived threat and the author's critique of Western response, not directly deflecting a criticism leveled *at the author or their position*.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. Its primary purpose is not balanced reporting but to promote a specific, alarmist viewpoint about Islam and jihad, using numerous propaganda techniques:
*   It heavily relies on **Appeal to Fear** and **Loaded Language** to evoke strong negative emotions (fear, outrage, disgust) towards the subject (Islamist extremism, framed as representative of Islam).
*   It employs **Exaggeration/Minimization**, **Causal Oversimplification**, **Black & White Fallacy**, and **Thought-Terminating Clichés** to present a simplistic, monolithic, and historically constant view of Islam centered on violent conquest, dismissing complexity, historical context, diversity of belief among Muslims, and genuine opposition to extremism.
*   It uses **Name Calling**, **Straw Men**, and **Doubt** to attack its targets (Israel/Jews, perceived Western apathy, mainstream Muslim organizations) and misrepresent opposing viewpoints.
*   It includes irrelevant distractions (**Red Herring** - Kavanaugh poll) and cites sources (**Appeal to Authority**) selectively to bolster its narrative.
*   The **Repetition** of the poll question and the use of **Slogans** ("Allahu akbar") further manipulate the reader's attention and emotional response.
While the text reports on a real event (Khecharem's speech, via MEMRI), its framing, commentary, selective emphasis, and the techniques used transform it into propaganda aimed at persuading the audience of a specific, ideologically driven interpretation of Islam and its perceived threat. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the factual basis of the reported speech but underscores that the overwhelming presentation is propagandistic.
