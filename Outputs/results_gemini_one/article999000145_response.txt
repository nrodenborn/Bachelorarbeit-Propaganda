1. Name calling – Yes – Explanation: The text labels a piece of legislation sponsored by a Democrat as an "'Open Borders Bill'", an insulting label designed to discredit it. It also quotes Trump calling the Kavanaugh confirmation process a "disgrace."
2. Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – Yes – Explanation: The phrase "'Speaker Pelosi'" is used as a brief, memorable, and negative rallying cry to motivate voters.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation: The text supports voting Republican by instilling fear of the alternative: “If you don’t want to be saying the words ‘Speaker Pelosi’ for the next two years, you gotta go out and vote”.
5. Doubt – Yes – Explanation: The text seeks to create doubt about Senator Joe Donnelly's credibility by listing his votes against tax cuts and for Justice Kavanaugh's opponent, implying he does not represent his constituents' interests.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: The text exaggerates by claiming Donnelly "voted to provide free health care to illegal aliens" and sponsored an "'Open Borders Bill'", which are inflammatory characterizations rather than neutral descriptions of legislation.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation: The poll question about using "military force" to stop migrants at the "U.S. border" appeals to feelings of patriotism and national security.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like "disgrace," "illegal aliens," and "attacks on conservatives" to appeal to emotion.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation: The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: The text assumes a simple cause for a complex event by stating that a vote for Donnelly would lead directly to Chuck Schumer becoming the Senate Majority Leader.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation: The article uses the authority of the sitting president, Donald Trump, and his quoted statements as the primary evidence for its arguments.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation: The poll presents only two options for a complex issue: "Yes, military force should be used" or "No, keep the military out of it," ignoring all other possible solutions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation: The author's opening statement, "...which everyone should do," presents a political opinion as an obvious truth, discouraging critical thought or discussion.
16. Red herring – Yes – Explanation: The article, which is about an election rally in Indiana, introduces an unrelated and emotionally charged poll about a migrant caravan to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – Yes – Explanation: The text refutes a distorted version of an opponent's position by labeling legislation as an "'Open Borders Bill'", making it easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – Explanation: The text attacks political opponents but does not do so by accusing them of hypocrisy for actions their own side has also committed.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. It is not a neutral news report but a persuasive piece from a biased source ("Freedom Outpost") designed to influence the reader's vote. It employs a high concentration of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. The article uses **Appeal to Fear** (the threat of "Speaker Pelosi"), **Loaded Language** ("disgrace," "illegal aliens"), and **Name-Calling** to create a strong emotional reaction against the Democratic party. It presents **Black & White Fallacies** (the poll choices) and **Causal Oversimplifications** (a vote for X directly causes Y) to make its preferred choice seem like the only logical option. Furthermore, it uses **Bandwagon** appeals ("which everyone should do"), a **Red Herring** (the migrant caravan poll), and a strong **Appeal to Authority** (President Trump) to reinforce its message. The combination and density of these techniques, coupled with the author's explicit call to action, firmly place the text in the category of propaganda rather than objective journalism or reasoned opinion.
