Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents as “leftist colleagues,” “Democrat obstructionists,” and describes their actions as “contemptible, obstructionist tactics.”

Repetition – Yes – The idea that the allegation is a “last-minute” political tactic to “derail” or “torpedo” the confirmation is repeated throughout the text, such as in the title “The Last-Minute Character Assassination” and phrases like “at the eleventh hour” and “last-minute attempt to derail.”

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the style of a classic slogan.

Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses on generating outrage and discrediting opponents rather than instilling fear in the audience about the consequences of an alternative outcome.

Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the credibility of Christine Blasey Ford and the Democrats, for example by highlighting her memory gaps (“she ‘said she does not remember some key details of the incident’”) and the timing of her coming forward (“How convenient, coming just 4 days before the scheduled Senate Judiciary Committee vote!”).

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the actions of the Democrats, calling them a “shameless smear campaign” and their lowest level of “character assassination yet.” It also minimizes the allegation by referring to it as “purported teenage sexual mischief.”

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as “despicable tactic,” “character assassination,” “cesspool of public gossip,” and “shameless smear campaign,” all designed to evoke strong negative emotions in the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest that the idea is popular with groups like Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text cites a letter from “65 women who said they knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school” to vouch for his character, appealing to the weight of their collective number to support the argument.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex event by stating that the entire situation is simply “a ruse to block Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation by all means necessary,” ignoring other potential motivations or factors.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct in its accusations and point of view; it does not use intentionally vague or obscure language to confuse the audience.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the FBI’s decision not to “pursue any further investigation” and a letter from “65 women who said they knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school” as evidence of his good character and the weakness of the allegation.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as having only two sides: Judge Kavanaugh is an innocent victim of a “shameless smear campaign,” and the Democrats and his accuser are malicious political operatives. It does not allow for any nuance or the possibility that the accuser could be sincere, even if mistaken.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not rely on common, cliché phrases designed to shut down debate.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the past actions of feminists regarding “Bill Clinton” and Senator Feinstein’s opinion of “Ted ‘Chappaquiddick’ Kennedy” to distract from the specifics of the Kavanaugh allegation and instead focus on the perceived hypocrisy of his opponents.

Straw men – No – The text directly attacks the accuser and her story as presented, rather than misrepresenting her argument and refuting that misrepresentation.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges opponents with hypocrisy by stating, “Feminists gave the serial sexual predator Bill Clinton a free pass… Senator Feinstein called Ted ‘Chappaquiddick’ Kennedy an ‘inspiration and a friend,’” deflecting from the current issue by pointing to the alleged past behavior of the opposition.

***

Verdict – 95% – This text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint by manipulating information and appealing to emotion. The text employs a wide array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal.

The piece immediately frames the issue with a title using loaded language ("Character Assassination"). Throughout the text, it consistently uses name-calling ("leftist colleagues," "obstructionists"), loaded language ("despicable," "cesspool," "shameless smear"), and exaggeration to portray Judge Kavanaugh's opponents in the most negative light possible. It systematically works to create doubt about the accuser's credibility and motives, while simultaneously oversimplifying the entire complex situation into a simple political "ruse."

Furthermore, it uses the black & white fallacy by presenting only two options: either Kavanaugh is a completely innocent victim of a political hit, or you are on the side of the malicious Democrats. There is no room for nuance. The use of whataboutism and red herrings (bringing up Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy) is a classic propaganda tactic to deflect criticism and charge opponents with hypocrisy, distracting from the actual facts of the case being discussed. Finally, it leverages appeals to authority and the bandwagon effect by citing the FBI's inaction and the letter from 65 women as definitive proof of innocence.

An objective report would present the claims and counter-claims with neutral language, avoid speculating on motives, and refrain from using emotionally charged and accusatory rhetoric. This text does the opposite, making it a textbook case of propaganda designed to reinforce a particular narrative and discredit any opposition.
