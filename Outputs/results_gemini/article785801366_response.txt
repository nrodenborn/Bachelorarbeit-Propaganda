3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate its ideas, such as the title itself, “9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad,” and the first step, “Label the Enemy.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The text consistently works to cast doubt on the credibility and competence of the Obama administration and associated groups, stating its policies are “vague to the point of being meaningless and completely incapacitates us.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to Hitler or the Nazi party to discredit them.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – While demanding clarity from its opponents, the text uses vague and broad terms like “leftist enablers” and “totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces” without providing clear definitions, creating an ill-defined enemy.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites individuals like Sebastian Gorka, Robert Spencer, and Stephen Coughlin as experts whose views should be accepted as evidence, for instance, “as Sebastian Gorka urges in Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, the government needs to lay down a vision…”

16. Red herring – Yes – When discussing the “Countering Violent Extremism” policy, the text introduces the claim that the administration is actually worried about “right-wing Islamophobes,” distracting from a substantive critique of the policy itself and reframing it as a purely political attack.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents opposing arguments to make them easier to attack, such as characterizing all opposition to mosque surveillance as a “suicidal leftist notion that it is ‘racist’ and Islamophobic,” ignoring more complex civil liberties arguments.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by pointing out the hypocrisy of an opponent. It engages in direct attacks rather than using this specific deflection tactic.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and comprehensive example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or to foster a nuanced discussion, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific and aggressive political viewpoint by employing a wide array of manipulative rhetorical techniques.

The text systematically constructs an "us vs. them" narrative, using flag-waving to establish the in-group ("America," "our civilization") and name-calling ("leftist enablers," "Jihadist Psychopath") to demonize the out-group. It heavily relies on appeals to emotion, particularly fear, with loaded language about an "unceasing onslaught" and a "catastrophic situation."

Furthermore, it delegitimizes all opposing viewpoints and policies through doubt, straw man arguments, and thought-terminating clichés, while presenting its own solutions as the only viable option (a black & white fallacy). The argument simplifies a highly complex global issue into a simple cause (causal oversimplification) and uses appeals to its own hand-picked authorities to validate its claims. The sheer density and combination of these techniques confirm that the piece is designed to bypass critical thinking and provoke an emotional, predetermined response in the reader, which is the fundamental goal of propaganda.
