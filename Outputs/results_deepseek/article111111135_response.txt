Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "powerful Jews" (used by Farrakhan), "filth and degenerate behavior" (used by Farrakhan), "anti-Semitic" (used to describe Farrakhan and his speech), "bigoted remarks" (used to describe Farrakhan's positions), "unbelievably vile" (used by Prof. Chireau to describe Farrakhan's remarks).
2.  **Repetition** – No – The text does not repeat the *same* core message over and over. It covers various aspects (the speech, the photo, the NOI, history, reactions).
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases intended as persuasive slogans are used within the text itself. ("Million Man March" is a named event, not a slogan used for persuasion here).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text reports on Farrakhan's remarks which *contain* appeals to fear (e.g., blaming Jews for societal decay), but the *text itself* does not use fear to persuade the reader towards a specific position or action. It reports the fear-based rhetoric as part of the news.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not primarily aim to question the credibility of Farrakhan or others; it reports established facts, condemnations (SPLC, ADL), defenses, and historical context. It presents his denials of anti-Semitism alongside evidence contradicting them without overtly trying to *make* the reader doubt.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text uses descriptive terms like "incendiary remarks," "flagrantly anti-Zionist," and "outstanding human being" (by Davis), but these are presented as factual descriptors or quotes from others, not as clear attempts by the *author* to exaggerate or minimize for persuasive effect. It reports both critical and defensive perspectives.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or a specific identity (like American, Jewish, Black) to persuade the reader. It discusses identity groups (Nation of Islam, Jews, Palestinians) within a factual reporting context.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Incendiary remarks," "bigoted remarks," "fervently opposed," "spill over," "infamous comments," "virtually synonymous with anti-Semitism," "unbelievably vile," "harmful and divisive views." These terms carry strong negative connotations aimed at evoking an emotional response towards Farrakhan's views.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – Explicitly referenced: "Among his more infamous comments is his 1984 description of Adolf Hitler as 'a very great man.'" This is cited to disapprove of Farrakhan by associating him with Hitler.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not argue for or against Farrakhan based on the popularity of his ideas. It mentions his historical support base and current criticism, but doesn't use popularity as evidence.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text does not present simplistic causes for complex events. It provides historical context for the Nation of Islam's positions and the reactions to Farrakhan.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific in its reporting. It defines terms (e.g., Saviour's Day), provides context, quotes sources, and uses precise language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites authorities to support its characterization of Farrakhan and the NOI: "condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center," "the Anti-Defamation League wrote...", "Edward E. Curtis IV... said", "Yvonne Chireau, a professor of religion...". It uses their statements as evidence for its descriptions.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents nuanced perspectives, including defenses or contextualizations of Farrakhan's appeal alongside condemnations. It doesn't reduce the issue to only two stark choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – The text encourages understanding through context and multiple viewpoints. Phrases like "radical black self love" or "form of fundamentalism" are explanatory, not clichés used to shut down thought.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text remains focused on the topics of Farrakhan, his speech, the photo, the NOI, and the reactions. It doesn't introduce irrelevant material to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text accurately reports the views expressed (Farrakhan's remarks, Mallory's statements, Davis's comments, Curtis's analysis). It doesn't misrepresent or refute arguments that weren't made.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge opponents (like Mallory or Davis) with hypocrisy to deflect criticism. It reports their statements and reluctance to condemn, and the criticism they received, without employing this deflection tactic itself.

**Verdict – 15% –** The text is overwhelmingly a piece of factual news reporting. Its primary purpose is to inform readers about Louis Farrakhan's return to the news, detailing his controversial speech, the context of the Nation of Islam, relevant history, and the reactions of public figures like Mallory and Davis. It presents multiple perspectives, including condemnations from organizations (SPLC, ADL), scholars (Curtis, Chireau), and Obama's spokesperson, as well as defenses or contextualizations (Mallory's personal connection, Davis's initial praise, Muhammad's admiration). While it uses **Loaded Language** (e.g., "incendiary," "bigoted," "vile") and cites **Appeals to Authority** (SPLC, ADL, scholars) to describe Farrakhan's views – techniques common even in objective reporting to convey severity – these are used within a framework of presenting evidence and established viewpoints rather than to manipulate the reader towards a specific, unstated agenda. The reporting of Farrakhan's own use of **Name Calling** and the historical **Reduction ad Hitlerum** instance are presented as factual elements of the story, not as techniques employed *by the author* for persuasion. The absence of techniques like Repetition, Fear appeals, Bandwagon, Obfuscation, False Dilemmas, etc., strongly indicates a journalistic intent to inform rather than propagandize. The 15% reflects the inherent use of some persuasive language common in reporting on controversial figures, but the core structure and content are informational.
