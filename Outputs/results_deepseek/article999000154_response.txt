### Propaganda Technique Analysis
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "hijab-wearing, devout Muslim" (used pejoratively to imply extremism), "hateful views".  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan..." is repeated verbatim three times.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are coined or emphasized beyond the repeated poll question.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The poll implies migrants are a threat requiring military force, and Omar's views are framed as dangerous to American values.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Omar’s credibility by alleging she "married her brother" and implying deceit.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates: "Islamic Jew-hatred is in the Quran" (misrepresenting Islamic texts). Minimizes: Reduces Democratic support to "identity politics".  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Evil doings", "apartheid state", "hateful views", "shameful", "identity politics" (all emotionally charged).

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Claims are direct and inflammatory, not obscured.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authoritative figures or institutions are cited as evidence (PJ Media is not framed as authoritative).  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The poll offers only two extreme choices ("military force" vs. "keep the military out") on migrants.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Islamic Jew-hatred is in the Quran" shuts down debate by oversimplifying theology.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The migrant poll distracts from the article’s focus on Omar.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Refutes actual claims Omar made (e.g., calling Israel an "apartheid state").

### Verdict – 95% – This text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs multiple techniques to smear Ilhan Omar and the Democratic Party, including **name calling**, **loaded language**, and **causal oversimplification** (e.g., reducing her policy critiques to religious "Jew-hatred"). The inclusion of an irrelevant, fear-based **red herring** (migrant caravan poll) further distracts and inflames emotions. Claims like "married her brother" are presented without verification, relying on **doubt** and **exaggeration**. The text’s core purpose is to delegitimize Omar through religious/cultural bigotry and falsely link her views to the entire Democratic base, aligning with propaganda’s goal of manipulating perception rather than informing. The 5% uncertainty stems only from the unverified marriage claim; however, its delivery and context are overwhelmingly propagandistic.
