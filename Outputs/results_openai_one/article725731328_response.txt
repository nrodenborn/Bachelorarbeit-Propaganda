**Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, and reduction ad Hitlerum. These techniques are used to influence the reader's perception of Obama, the media, and other figures by presenting a narrative that suggests a conspiracy and hidden agendas. The presence of multiple propaganda techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is intended to persuade or manipulate the audience's views rather than provide an objective account.**
