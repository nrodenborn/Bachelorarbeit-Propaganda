Verdict – 20% – The text contains some elements that could be considered propaganda, such as doubt, loaded language, and appeal to authority. However, these elements are not pervasive or dominant throughout the text. The primary focus of the article is to report on the reappointment of Cardinal O’Malley and the revival of the Vatican abuse panel, with some critical perspectives from abuse survivors. The presence of a few propaganda techniques does not overwhelmingly characterize the text as propaganda.
