1. Name calling – No – The text does not use any insulting labels to attack any person, group, or subject.
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat a specific message to reinforce it; it presents a series of facts and updates.
3. Slogans – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to encapsulate an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – No – While the subject matter (Ebola) is inherently frightening, the text reports facts ("severe, often fatal illness," "17 deaths") rather than using fear to support a specific idea against an alternative. The fear is a natural reaction to the information, not a tool of persuasion.
5. Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any source; in fact, it relies on official sources to provide information.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text provides specific numbers and factual statements from health organizations without any apparent exaggeration or minimization.
7. Flag-Waving – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – No – The language is factual and clinical ("hemorrhagic fever," "Zaire strain," "human-to-human transmission"). It avoids emotionally charged or stereotypical words.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparison to hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is valid because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text provides a relatively detailed explanation of the virus's transmission, mentioning wild animals, bats, monkeys, and bushmeat, which is the opposite of oversimplification.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is specific, providing names, locations, and figures, aiming for clarity rather than confusion.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites "a government health official," "Jean Jack Muyembe, head of the national institute for biological research," "the health ministry," and "The World Health Organisation" as sources for its information.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present two opposing options as the only possibilities.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases that would discourage critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – All the information provided, including the history of the disease and its transmission, is relevant to the topic.
17. Straw men – No – The text is a report and does not refute any arguments, real or misrepresented.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing others of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 0% – The text is a factual news report. Its purpose is to inform the public about a significant health event, not to persuade the audience to adopt a particular viewpoint or ideology. It uses neutral, objective language and attributes its information to relevant and credible authorities (government health officials, the WHO), which is a standard of journalism, not a manipulative tactic in this context. The article lacks the emotional manipulation, biased framing, and persuasive intent that characterize propaganda.
