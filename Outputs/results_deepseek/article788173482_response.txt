Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Deep State Plotters" (headline), "frauds" (referring to Democratic lawmakers), "rent-a-spy" (referring to Christopher Steele), "disgraced ex-FBI employees" (referring to Strzok and Lisa Page).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "hoax" is used repeatedly (e.g., "began as a 'hoax'", "It's a hoax").
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, memorable slogan is used beyond repeated terms like "hoax" or "witch hunt".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "nameless, faceless bureaucrats of the Deep State who hide behind anonymity to undermine the duly elected 45th president" instills fear of a hidden enemy subverting democracy.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Although the conspiracy theory is baseless nonsense, it continues to dog the Trump administration" casts doubt on the legitimacy of the investigation.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "one of the great scandals in the history of our country" (exaggeration), "selectively declassifying information" (minimizing the scope/justification of Trump's order - according to the text's perspective).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "shameful un-American plot", "undermine the duly elected 45th president", "sweeping order... may shed light on what really happened", "great service to the country" appeal to patriotism and American values.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Pervasive: "hoax", "witch hunt", "corrupt", "shameful un-American plot", "rig", "undermine", "privacy-invading apparatus", "salacious, unverified dossier", "nefarious links", "frauds", "publicly humiliated", "usurp", "brazen abuse of power", "unaccountable Deep State operatives", "dirt".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No explicit linking of opponents/ideas to universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – While popularity is implied ("request of a number of committees of Congress"), the text doesn't primarily argue something is true/good *because* it's popular.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes the complex Russia investigation and related controversies primarily to a deliberate, corrupt conspiracy by the "Left", "Deep State", Obama, Clinton, and the FBI ("this shameful un-American plot to rig the 2016 election").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is highly opinionated but generally direct in its accusations. Terms like "Deep State" are vague but used consistently within the narrative.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites President Trump's statements and perspective as authoritative evidence throughout. Also uses Rep. Nunes' approval ("hailed Trump’s order") as support.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as Trump/patriots fighting back against a corrupt "Deep State"/Leftist conspiracy. "How else does one fight back..." implies the declassification is the only valid response.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "let the chips fall where they may" is used to shut down potential criticism of the declassification's consequences.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on the investigation, declassification, and alleged conspiracy. The affair between Strzok and Page is arguably a red herring used to discredit them, but it *is* tangentially related to the texts being released.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Characterizes the Democratic lawmakers' letter as solely an attempt to hide wrongdoing ("alarmed at the prospect of being exposed as frauds and publicly humiliated", "attempt to usurp the powers vested in the president") and protect the investigation for corrupt reasons, ignoring potential stated concerns about process or national security.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – "For example, it was established some time ago that former President Obama was involved..." shifts focus to Obama's alleged involvement when discussing criticism/actions against Trump and his administration.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a high concentration of propaganda techniques (10 clear Yes, 3 borderline Yes/No leaning Yes, 5 No) to advance a singular, highly partisan narrative. The core purpose is not balanced reporting or objective analysis, but to persuade the reader that:
1.  The Russia investigation was a corrupt "hoax" and "witch hunt" orchestrated by the "Deep State," Democrats, Obama, and biased FBI officials.
2.  President Trump is a victim and hero for exposing this conspiracy ("crowning achievement," "great service").
3.  Opponents (Democrats, specific FBI officials) are inherently corrupt, dishonest ("frauds," "lie"), and acting against American interests ("un-American plot," "usurp," "abuse of power").
4.  Declassification is the necessary and only valid response to this hidden threat.

The pervasive use of **Loaded Language**, **Name Calling**, **Appeal to Fear**, **Flag-Waving**, **Causal Oversimplification**, **Doubt**, and **Straw Men** creates a highly emotional, us-vs-them narrative designed to confirm existing biases and discredit opposing viewpoints without engaging with their substance. While it reports factual elements (the declassification order, the existence of the Democratic letter), these are framed entirely within this propagandistic perspective. The absence of countervailing facts, context, or perspectives typical of neutral reporting further confirms its propagandistic nature.
