1. Name calling – Yes – The author labels those who disagree with their interpretation of Romans 13 as “Biblical Illiterates,” “confused,” “perverse, modern-day, professing Christians,” and suggests their opponent is guilty of twisting scripture “the way that Satan twists Scripture.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that Christians must resist corrupt authority is repeated through numerous biblical and historical examples (Moses, David, Daniel, the Founding Fathers, etc.). Additionally, the poll question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate its message, such as quoting the motto of the American Revolution, “No King but King Jesus,” and the declaration, “Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God!"
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that following the opposing view (submitting to corrupt authority) means one is “fighting against God,” siding with evil, and being complicit in things God condemns. It warns, “lest you find yourselves to be fighting against God (Acts 5:39).”
5. Doubt – Yes – The author actively questions the credibility and knowledge of the person who wrote the opposing article, stating, “maybe this individual should take the time to know a little bit of his own history!” and that he “knows nothing of the Black Robed Regiment.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the opposing viewpoint with the title “Teach Submit to Tyranny!” implying an absolute and unthinking submission. The text also minimizes the complexity of Romans 13 by presenting a single, narrow interpretation as the only correct one.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text repeatedly appeals to American patriotism by referencing the “founding forefathers,” “The Declaration of Independence,” Patrick Henry, John Hancock, and the “motto of the American Revolution” to support its argument.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as “Tyranny,” “corrupt representative,” “usurpations,” “wicked,” and “perverse, modern-day, professing Christians.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest that the opposing idea is popular with groups like Nazis or other figures generally hated by the target audience. It uses other villains (Pharaoh, Herod, Pharisees), but does not fit the specific definition.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text argues against what it portrays as a popular modern teaching, instead appealing to a historical tradition. It does not claim its idea is popular now and should be followed for that reason.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests the reason people teach submission to authority is simply because they are “biblically illiterate” or have been misled, ignoring centuries of complex theological debate and interpretation on the topic of Romans 13.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s position is direct, forceful, and unambiguous. There is no attempt to be vague or obscure the message.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author repeatedly cites authorities to validate their position, including the “founding forefathers,” John Hancock, William Blackstone, and numerous figures from the Bible like Moses, David, and the apostles.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either one submits to tyranny and is therefore a “biblically illiterate” Christian who disobeys God, or one resists tyranny and is obedient to God. It ignores any nuanced positions between these two extremes.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like “Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God!” as a definitive, unchallengeable truth that is meant to end any further discussion or critical analysis of the complex scriptural passages in question.
16. Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of the poll, “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is completely irrelevant to the theological argument about Romans 13 and serves to distract the reader and collect user data.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an oversimplified and extreme version of the opposing argument. They characterize the other side as teaching blind “Submit to Tyranny,” a position that is easy to attack, rather than engaging with the likely more nuanced theological argument about the role and limits of civil obedience presented in Romans 13.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text directly attacks the opponent's argument rather than deflecting criticism by charging the opponent with hypocrisy on another matter.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. It employs a vast majority (14 out of 18) of the listed techniques to advocate for its position. The author's goal is not to foster a balanced theological discussion but to aggressively push a specific political and religious viewpoint. This is achieved by systematically attacking the character and intelligence of the opposition (Name Calling, Doubt), misrepresenting their argument to make it easier to attack (Straw Man, Exaggeration), and appealing to powerful emotions like patriotism and fear (Flag-Waving, Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language). The argument is built on a foundation of logical fallacies, primarily the Black & White Fallacy, which presents a false choice between total submission to evil and the author's righteous path of resistance. The use of a completely irrelevant Red Herring (the Kavanaugh poll) further demonstrates that the article's purpose is not purely informational. The entire piece is structured to bypass critical thought and lead the reader to a pre-determined conclusion.
