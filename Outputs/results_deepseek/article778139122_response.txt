Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Vichy journalism" (attacks mainstream media as collaborators akin to Nazi sympathizers).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No identical phrases are repeated excessively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "If Julian Assange is allowed to literally go under, it represents the conquest of all of us" (implies catastrophic consequences of inaction).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "I think there is collusion" (questions government credibility without concrete proof).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "the most unprecedented persecution" (exaggerates severity) and "100% record of accuracy" (overstates WikiLeaks' infallibility).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "witch hunt," "super-max hellhole," "rapacious establishment" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – "Vichy journalism" (compares media to Nazi collaborators).  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes Assange’s situation solely to government "collusion," ignoring legal/complex factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Statements are direct, not deliberately obscure.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Pilger speaks from personal perspective; no external authorities cited.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – "truly independent" (WikiLeaks) vs. "Vichy" media (implies only two moral categories).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "end of discussion" to halt debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions introduced.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Opposing arguments are not misrepresented.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements through loaded language, causal oversimplification, black-and-white framing, and historical analogies (e.g., Nazis/Vichy). Pilger’s rhetoric emotionally amplifies injustice while dismissing counter-narratives, framing Assange as a martyr and governments/media as villains. However, it includes factual claims (e.g., Assange’s lack of formal charges, WikiLeaks’ document releases) and avoids techniques like outright falsehoods or overt scapegoating. Its persuasive intent and selective emphasis on persecution over legal nuances align with propaganda, but its basis in verifiable events prevents a higher likelihood score.
