Here is the analysis of the text based on the provided propaganda techniques.

1.  **Name calling – Yes –** The text repeatedly uses insulting labels to attack Pope Francis. Examples include calling him a “virtuoso performance-liar,” a “professional confidence trickster,” and quoting the title of a book that calls him “The Dictator Pope.”

2.  **Repetition – Yes –** The text repeats the central message that the Pope is a liar and that his stock response to accusations is “no evidence.” This is seen in phrases like “the pope lied,” “‘No evidence…’ Lie big, lie often, and when caught, keep lying,” “blatant and enormous lie,” and “It is now irrefutable that Pope Bergoglio is a habitual liar.”

3.  **Slogans – Yes –** The text employs a brief, memorable, and aggressive phrase to summarize its accusation: “‘No evidence…’ Lie big, lie often, and when caught, keep lying.”

4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes –** The text suggests dire consequences will result from the Pope’s actions, warning that the “general loss of trust in institutions leads to a general state of chaos” and asking, “how long before that predictable disintegration occurs?” It also states the situation is “potentially very harmful for souls in the long run.”

5.  **Doubt – Yes –** The entire article is an exercise in casting doubt on the Pope’s credibility, actions, and motives. For example, it states, “It also calls into question his stated empathy with abuse survivors,” and “Vatican analysts now openly question whether he ‘gets it.’”

6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes –** The text exaggerates the Pope’s alleged deceit by calling his pontificate “one of the great confidence scams in history.” It also accuses the Pope of minimization by repeatedly highlighting his dismissal of victims’ testimony as having “no evidence.”

7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes –** The text appeals to a specific Catholic identity by contrasting the Pope’s actions with traditional beliefs. It claims he is in “direct contradiction to Catholic teaching” and that “Believing Catholics have watched aghast as this pope has habitually trampled on every aspect of Catholic teaching.”

8.  **Loaded Language – Yes –** The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to create a negative impression. Examples include “convicted sex-predator,” “vicious temper tantrums,” “grifters and confidence tricksters,” and the reference to the “San Gallen Mafia.”

9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes –** The text disapproves of the Pope’s alleged strategy by associating it with a hated historical group. It states his policy is “in line with that of certain leaders of the past who recommended that if a politician was going to lie, he should lie big and lie brazenly,” a clear reference to the “Big Lie” propaganda theory associated with Nazi Germany.

10. **Bandwagon – Yes –** The text suggests that its negative view of the Pope is becoming widespread to encourage readers to agree. It claims, “this is what is now being said quite openly by a vast array of voices, secular and Catholic, left and right,” and that the Pope’s “support has completely dried up.”

11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes –** The text reduces the complex reasons for the Pope’s personnel decisions to a single, sinister motive: “whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb.”

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No –** The author’s own writing is direct and clear in its accusations. While it cites sources that are sometimes vague (like the Marco Tosatti story), the author points out this vagueness rather than using it to obscure their own point. The goal is accusation, not confusion.

13. **Appeal to authority – Yes –** The text builds its case by citing various journalists, publications, and figures as evidence. Examples include the “Associated Press,” “La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana,” “Sandro Magister,” Cardinal O’Malley, and Marie Collins.

14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes –** The text presents a false dilemma to force a conclusion. It states there is “really only one” logical possibility to explain the events surrounding the victim’s letter: “that the pope lied,” ignoring other potential explanations like miscommunication, memory failure, or bureaucratic error.

15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes –** The text uses phrases to shut down debate and present its conclusions as final. For instance, it states, “It is now irrefutable that Pope Bergoglio is a habitual liar,” using “irrefutable” to discourage any counter-argument.

16. **Red herring – Yes –** The text introduces related but tangential issues to bolster its character assassination of the Pope, distracting from the main case. The long analysis of the “Who am I to judge” comment and the use of the word “gay” diverts from the specific Chilean scandal to build a broader case against the Pope’s entire pontificate.

17. **Straw men – Yes –** The text misrepresents the Pope’s “Who am I to judge” statement, reframing it not as a pastoral comment but as a “conspiratorial wink and nod” to a political movement. This creates an easily attackable, nefarious version of the Pope’s position.

18. **Whataboutism – Yes –** The text is structured around charging the Pope with hypocrisy. It constantly contrasts his stated policy of “zero tolerance” for abuse with his alleged actions of protecting and promoting clerics like Bishop Barros and Monsignore Ricca.

***

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly a work of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt an extremely negative and hostile view of Pope Francis. It achieves this by employing a vast arsenal of propaganda techniques (17 out of the 18 listed). The language is not neutral but heavily loaded, using name-calling and emotional appeals. The argumentation relies on logical fallacies like the Black & White Fallacy and Causal Oversimplification to force a single, sinister conclusion. It systematically builds its case by appealing to select authorities while casting doubt on the Pope's every word and action. The author constructs a narrative of a malicious, deceptive, and power-hungry figure, using repetition, exaggeration, and appeals to fear and identity to destroy the subject's credibility. The sheer density and combination of these techniques move the text far beyond critical journalism into the realm of a targeted polemic.
