Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No – No direct insulting labels are used against specific targets (e.g., no terms like "liar" or "traitor").  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Clinton repeats "20 years ago" (e.g., "This was litigated 20 years ago," "I dealt with it 20 years ago") to downplay the scandal.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to simplify complex ideas (e.g., no equivalents to "Make America Great Again").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No attempt to instill fear about alternatives (e.g., no warnings of dire consequences if Lewinsky is believed).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Clinton questions media credibility: "A lot of the facts have been omitted to make the story work... they're frustrated [about] allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Clinton minimizes his responsibility by claiming he "apologized to everybody in the world," exaggerates his victimhood ("financially ruined," "$16 million in debt"), and the text minimizes his actions by framing Lewinsky as "the young woman the President... used for his own pleasure."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or symbols.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms include "gross abuse of power," "traumatized," "Don Juan-like seductions," "used for his own pleasure," and "victim."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Clinton cites popularity to validate himself: "Two-thirds of the American people sided with me."  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified causes (e.g., debt isn't blamed solely on the scandal without context).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – Clinton references "gaping facts" and "omitted facts" but never specifies them, creating deliberate vagueness.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No external authorities or experts are cited for support.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Patterson reduces options to resigning or not: "You think President Kennedy should have resigned? Do you believe President Johnson should have resigned?" ignoring nuanced accountability.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Patterson uses "It's 20 years ago, come on!" and "Stop already!" to shut down discussion. Clinton ends with "That's all I have to say to you."  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Clinton deflects to Trump: "They're frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office," diverting from his own scandal.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Clinton refutes the unstated argument that past presidents should have resigned: "You think President Kennedy should have resigned? Do you believe President Johnson should have resigned?"  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Patterson deflects criticism by citing past presidents: "Let's talk about JFK. Let's talk about... LBJ."  

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic, primarily through Clinton’s and Patterson’s defenses. Techniques like *whataboutism* (deflecting to JFK/LBJ), *bandwagon* (citing public support), *repetition* (emphasizing "20 years ago"), *straw men* (resignation demands), and *loaded language* ("abuse of power," "victim") dominate. These tactics minimize Clinton’s accountability, reframe him as a victim, and attack media credibility (*doubt*). Lewinsky’s perspective ("gross abuse of power") adds balance but is overshadowed by the propagandistic framing of Clinton’s narrative. The text aims to rehabilitate Clinton’s image by distorting facts, deflecting blame, and silencing criticism, aligning with propaganda objectives. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges Lewinsky’s counterpoints and factual reporting of Clinton’s debt.
