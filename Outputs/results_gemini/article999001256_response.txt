1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Stacey Abrams as a “Sore Loser,” a “poor sport,” an “arrogant wanna-be,” and “this peach.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?” is repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea; it primarily uses insults and accusations.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear by suggesting a problem with “non-citizens and illegal aliens voting,” linking it to the Democratic party.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text directly questions the validity of Abrams’ claims by asking, “Where is her evidence? She has none.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes Abrams’ legal challenges and speech by calling it a “little temper tantrum.”
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism to make its point. It criticizes Abrams for her use of phrases like “erosion of our democracy” rather than using such appeals itself.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language, such as “temper tantrum,” “arrogant wanna-be,” and “Democrats are often like that in these races.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare Abrams or her ideas to groups like Nazis. It does compare her to Hillary Clinton, but this is not an example of this specific technique.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its viewpoint is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex reasons for Abrams’ challenge down to a single cause: she is a “sore loser” having a “temper tantrum.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct in its accusations and point of view, not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – No – While it quotes a newspaper, it does so to establish a basic fact, not to use the newspaper's authority to support its own opinionated claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll on Jim Acosta presents only two meaningful options, with the “No” option being loaded: “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass,” which frames the situation as a simple choice between rewarding good or bad behavior.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The statement “Democrats are often like that in these races” is a cliché that dismisses an individual's actions by attributing them to a group stereotype, discouraging further thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll and discussion about CNN’s Jim Acosta, which is entirely irrelevant to the Stacey Abrams story, serving to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the dictionary definition of “concession” rather than addressing Abrams’ actual point, which was about the moral implication of conceding that the election was “right, true or proper.”
18. Whataboutism – Yes – In response to Abrams’ claims of voter suppression, the author deflects by raising other potential election issues and blaming them on her party: “What about invalid provisional ballots...? How about non-citizens and illegal aliens voting...?”

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a highly negative and dismissive view of Stacey Abrams and, by extension, the Democratic party. It achieves this by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques.

The piece is framed with **name-calling** (“Sore Loser,” “arrogant wanna-be”) and relies heavily on **loaded language** (“temper tantrum”) to evoke an emotional response rather than a rational one. It uses **causal oversimplification** to reduce a complex legal and political challenge to a simple case of one person’s poor character.

Furthermore, it employs logical fallacies to undermine its subject and distract the reader. The entire section on Jim Acosta is a blatant **red herring**. It uses **whataboutism** to deflect Abrams’ accusations of voter suppression by insinuating her party is guilty of other electoral crimes. It attacks a **straw man** by arguing against a dictionary definition instead of Abrams' stated point.

The text actively works to discredit its target by casting **doubt** on her claims (“Where is her evidence?”) and using **thought-terminating clichés** (“Democrats are often like that”) to shut down critical analysis. The sheer number and blatant use of these techniques confirm that the text is not a piece of objective journalism or balanced commentary, but a work of propaganda designed to manipulate audience perception.
