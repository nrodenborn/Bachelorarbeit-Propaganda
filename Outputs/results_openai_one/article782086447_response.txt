**Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, obfuscation, intentional vagueness, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques suggest a strong likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it seeks to influence the reader's perception of Pope Francis and the Church's situation by using emotionally charged language, presenting a simplified view of a complex issue, and questioning the credibility of Church leaders. However, it does not employ all the techniques listed, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood.**
