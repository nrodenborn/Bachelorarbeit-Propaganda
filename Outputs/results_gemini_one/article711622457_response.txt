Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack a subject, for example, when it refers to "jihad preachers" and "Sharia supremacism," and quotes Trump's tweet about "destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism."
Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the core message that the UK government is hypocritical for wanting to ban critics of jihad while admitting "jihad preachers." Donald Trump's tweet is also shown twice in the text.
Slogans – Yes – The text quotes Donald Trump's tweet which ends with the brief, memorable phrase: "We are doing just fine!"
Appeal to fear – Yes – The text aims to instill fear by highlighting the violent rhetoric of individuals it claims the UK has admitted, such as Shaykh Hamza Sodagar, who is quoted as suggesting punishments including to "chop their head off" or "burn them to death."
Doubt – Yes – The author questions the credibility of the label used against him and Pamela Geller by asking: "Why are we “far right”?" and "That’s “far right”?"
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author minimizes the reason for his ban by framing it as a response to a single "demonstrably true statement," while simultaneously highlighting the most extreme examples of jihadist rhetoric to exaggerate the threat posed by those the UK has admitted.
Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a "defense of Britain and its values against jihad terror."
Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases such as "jihad atrocities," "destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism," and "Sharia supremacism" to evoke strong emotional reactions.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text reports that a Labour MP, Chris Bryant, used this technique by calling for a ban on Trump "on the grounds he is condoning fascism."
Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea should be accepted because it is popular.
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex political fallout from Trump's retweets by stating it is simply a "manifestation of the general tendency to blame those who call attention to jihad atrocities rather than to focus upon the jihad atrocities themselves."
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its accusations and provides specific examples and names rather than using intentionally vague language.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The author presents President Trump as an authority on the issue, stating "Trump himself said it best" and "Trump is right that the real problem is jihad terror and Sharia supremacism."
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a binary choice: the UK government is either focusing on the "real problem" of "jihad terror" or it is wrongly focusing on "the messenger" (Trump). It presents a world where the UK bans critics of jihad while welcoming "jihad preachers," ignoring other possibilities.
Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author's assertion that the statement he was banned for is a "demonstrably true statement" is presented as a final, unchallengeable fact intended to end that line of discussion.
Red herring – Yes – The main topic is the call to ban Trump for his retweets. The author distracts from this by introducing the topic of the UK admitting "jihad preachers" and banning Christian bishops, shifting the focus to the UK's alleged hypocrisy rather than Trump's actions.
Straw men – Yes – The author refutes the charge of "fascism" by creating a distorted version of his opponent's argument, stating: "For Chris Bryant, apparently “fascism” means “defense of Britain and its values against jihad terror.”"
Whataboutism – Yes – The entire article is structured as a whataboutism argument. In response to calls to ban Donald Trump, the author deflects by repeatedly asking, in effect, "What about the jihad preachers the UK has admitted?" and "What about the Christian bishops the UK has banned?"

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or engage in a balanced debate, but to persuade the reader to adopt the author's viewpoint by employing a wide array of manipulative techniques.

The article's entire structure is built upon the logical fallacies of **Whataboutism** and **Red Herring**. Instead of addressing the central issue—the appropriateness of President Trump's retweets and the subsequent call to ban him—the author immediately deflects to the alleged hypocrisy of the UK government. This is the core propagandistic strategy.

This strategy is supported by numerous other techniques. **Loaded Language** ("jihad atrocities," "Sharia supremacism") and **Appeal to Fear** (the graphic quotes from Shaykh Hamza Sodagar) are used to create a strong emotional response against the author's opponents. A **Black & White Fallacy** is presented where the UK can only choose between focusing on Trump or focusing on "jihad terror," ignoring any nuanced position. The author uses a **Straw Man** to redefine the accusation of "fascism" into something absurd and easily dismissed.

Furthermore, the author defends his own position by using **Doubt** to question the "far-right" label and **Minimization** to frame his ban as a response to a simple "demonstrably true statement." The use of a large number of propaganda techniques in a coordinated fashion to promote a specific agenda, while discrediting opposition through logical fallacies and emotional manipulation, confirms the text's nature as propaganda.
