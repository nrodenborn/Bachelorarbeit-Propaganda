Name calling – Yes – The text quotes a source describing the conquerors of Constantinople as ‘inhuman barbarians’ and ‘the most savage enemies of the Christian faith, by the fiercest of wild beasts.’ It also labels people who might disagree with the author's premise as ‘gullible Westerners.’

Repetition – Yes – The poll question ‘Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?’ is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – Yes – The phrase “arm yourself with the truth” is used as a brief, memorable call to action.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses a graphic historical account of violence (‘Men have been butchered like cattle, women abducted, virgins ravished’) and directly connects it to the modern issue of ‘mass Muslim migration into Europe and North America,’ implying a similar fate awaits if resistance is not offered.

Doubt – Yes – The line “So much for the much-vaunted Islamic “tolerance” in Europe” is used to cast doubt on the entire concept of historical Islamic tolerance.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggerated language from a historical source, such as ‘butchered like cattle’ and ‘fiercest of wild beasts,’ to create a dramatic effect. It also minimizes the work of most historians by claiming they simply ‘turn their attention away’ from the aftermath of the conquest.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a collective identity by framing the conflict as one against ‘the Christian faith’ and by addressing ‘gullible Westerners,’ invoking a sense of Western and/or Christian identity that is under threat.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as ‘warriors of jihad,’ ‘inhuman barbarians,’ ‘savage enemies,’ ‘butchered like cattle,’ and ‘virgins ravished,’ to provoke a strong emotional response from the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to the Nazis or other similarly hated groups to discredit them.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular and that the reader should join the crowd. In fact, it suggests the reader should go against the "gullible" majority.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text implies that the singular cause for the historical violence described was ‘jihad’ and that this same cause will inevitably lead to the same effects in the context of modern ‘mass Muslim migration,’ ignoring all other complex historical, social, and political factors.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text’s message is direct and its language, while emotional, is not intentionally vague or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites ‘the Byzantine scholar Bessarion’ to lend credibility to its historical claims. It also presents the author, Robert Spencer, and his book as the ultimate authority on the ‘truth’ of the matter.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy: either you are a ‘gullible Westerner’ being ‘fooled’ by tales of Islamic tolerance, or you ‘arm yourself with the truth’ by accepting the author’s narrative and buying his book. It leaves no room for a nuanced or alternative perspective.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “So much for the much-vaunted Islamic “tolerance”...” is used as a dismissive statement to shut down any further discussion or consideration of the topic.

Red herring – Yes – The repeated poll about Brett Kavanaugh is completely irrelevant to the article's topic of Islamic history and migration. It serves as a distraction and a tool for data collection.

Straw men – Yes – The text creates a caricature of the argument for ‘Islamic “tolerance”’, presenting it as a simple-minded effort to ‘fool gullible Westerners.’ It then attacks this simplified, misrepresented version of the argument rather than engaging with actual nuanced historical scholarship on the topic.

Whataboutism – No – The text attacks its opponents but does not do so by accusing them of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. It employs a very high number (14 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques to achieve its goal. The primary purpose is not to present a balanced historical account, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, fearful worldview regarding Islam and Muslim migration, and ultimately, to purchase the author's book.

The piece relies heavily on emotional manipulation through **Loaded Language** (‘butchered like cattle’), **Name Calling** (‘inhuman barbarians’), and a powerful **Appeal to Fear**. It builds a logically flawed argument using a **Black & White Fallacy** (you are either ‘gullible’ or you accept the author’s ‘truth’), **Causal Oversimplification** (jihad is the sole cause of historical and future violence), and a **Straw Man** (attacking a simplistic version of ‘Islamic tolerance’). It attempts to distract the reader with a **Red Herring** (the Kavanaugh poll) while using an **Appeal to Authority** (a Byzantine scholar and the author himself) to legitimize its claims. The combination of these techniques creates a persuasive but highly manipulative message designed to bypass critical thinking in favor of an emotional reaction and a specific call to action.
