Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: The text exaggerates the bravery of Brett Kavanaugh ("Judge Kavanaugh has faced it all and fought back against it.") while minimizing the scrutiny of the allegations against Ellison by quoting a journalist only to immediately dismiss the point ("The story... not held up under media scrutiny...

Thought-terminating clichés – No – Explanation: The text does not use clichés to shut down critical thought.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. It employs a multitude of propaganda techniques with the primary goal of persuading the audience, rather than informing them objectively. The piece is not a balanced news report but a one-sided attack piece. It heavily relies on emotional manipulation through **Name-calling** ("effeminate pansy") and **Loaded Language**. Its core logical structure is built on the fallacies of **Whataboutism** and a **Black & White Fallacy**, constantly creating a false and simplistic comparison between Ellison and Kavanaugh to discredit Democrats. The author actively works to instill **Doubt** about Ellison, his party's investigation, and the media. Finally, the inclusion of a completely irrelevant **Red Herring** poll is a hallmark of agenda-driven content over factual reporting. The cumulative effect of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion.
