**Name calling – Yes –** The text uses the term “illegals” and “criminal illegals” to label the people arrested, which is a form of name-calling.

**Repetition – Yes –** The text repeatedly reinforces the idea that the mayor’s actions were politically motivated and dangerous, stating she “tried to warn the constituents,” her decision was “reckless” and “based on her political agenda,” and she “betrayed the law-abiding citizens.”

**Slogans – Yes –** The text uses the phrase “law and order” to frame the issue, as seen in: “True to the left's support for criminality over law and order…”

**Appeal to fear – Yes –** The text instills fear by highlighting that about half of those arrested had convictions for “assault and battery, crimes against children, weapons charges and DUI” and that “864 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions and other public safety threats ‘remain at large’”.

**Doubt – Yes –** The text questions the mayor’s credibility and motives by stating her decision was “based on her political agenda” and notes that the Department of Justice is being asked to “look into whether she broke any laws.”

**Exaggeration/minimization – Yes –** The text exaggerates the position of an entire political group with the statement, “True to the left's support for criminality over law and order,” which is a broad generalization. It also minimizes the non-criminal individuals arrested by focusing almost exclusively on those with convictions.

**Flag-Waving – Yes –** The text appeals to patriotism by contrasting the ICE officers who “fulfill their sworn duty to protect public safety” with the mayor who “betrayed the law-abiding citizens of Northern California.”

**Loaded Language – Yes –** The text uses emotionally charged words like “illegals,” “fugitives,” “reckless,” and “betrayed” to influence the reader's emotions.

**Reduction ad Hitlerum – No –** The text does not compare any idea or person to Hitler or associated groups.

**Bandwagon – No –** The text does not suggest that an idea is correct because it is popular.

**Causal Oversimplification – Yes –** The text simplifies the mayor’s complex decision by attributing it to a single cause: “her political agenda,” ignoring other potential motivations.

**Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No –** The text is direct in its accusations and does not use deliberately unclear language to confuse the audience.

**Appeal to authority – Yes –** The text uses the authority of ICE Deputy Director Thomas Homan, quoting his statement to support its argument against the mayor. It also cites “Fox News” and “ICE reports” as sources.

**Black & white fallacy – Yes –** The text presents the situation as a simple choice between “criminality” (the mayor’s side) and “law and order” (ICE’s side), ignoring any other possible perspectives or nuances.

**Thought-terminating clichés – Yes –** The text uses the phrase “law and order,” which is often used to shut down debate on the complexities of justice and law enforcement.

**Red herring – Yes –** The text provides a detailed account of one specific gang member’s extensive criminal history to characterize all the immigrants who avoided arrest, distracting from the fact that the actual impact of the mayor’s warning is unknown.

**Straw men – Yes –** The text refutes the argument that the mayor supports criminality (“True to the left's support for criminality”), which is a misrepresentation of her likely and more complex position on sanctuary cities and civil liberties.

**Whataboutism – No –** The text focuses its criticism on the mayor and does not attempt to deflect by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is highly propagandistic. It moves beyond factual reporting into persuasive framing by employing a vast number of propaganda techniques. The narrative is not balanced but is constructed as a simple conflict between a heroic law enforcement agency (“sworn duty to protect public safety”) and a villainous politician who sides with criminals (“betrayed the law-abiding citizens”). This is achieved through the pervasive use of loaded language, name-calling, and appeals to fear, which are designed to provoke an emotional response rather than rational analysis. Furthermore, the text relies on logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy (“law and order” vs. “criminality”), a straw man of the mayor’s position, and causal oversimplification of her motives. By selectively highlighting the most dangerous criminals and quoting only authority figures who support its narrative, the text presents a biased and manipulative account of the event, fitting the definition of propaganda.
