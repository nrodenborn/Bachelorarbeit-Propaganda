Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "blue privilege" (used as an insulting label for perceived special treatment given to police).
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "blue privilege" is used as a brief, memorable phrase encapsulating the article's core critique.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "Super scary because the police are supposed to protect you..." (Instills fear about police actions).
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "The details of how or why this officer would walk into an apartment that was not hers are unclear." (Casts doubt on the officer's account/actions).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – "Highlighting the *sheer insane state* of law enforcement in America today..." (Exaggerates the overall state of law enforcement). Also, "simply placed on administrative leave" minimizes the action taken against the officer.
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – No appeal to patriotism or national/group identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "tragic story", "sheer insane state", "glaring function of blue privilege", "slap to the face", "grieving for the rest of their lives". These use emotionally charged words and phrases.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or other universally despised groups.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – No appeal to the popularity of an idea is present.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – "If an average citizen walked into the wrong home and shot and killed an innocent homeowner, rest assured that they would be in jail—right now." (Oversimplifies the complex legal factors involved in arrests and prosecutions, implying the *only* difference is police status).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes** – "While the details surrounding how Jean was killed are unclear..." and "The details of how or why this officer would walk into an apartment that was not hers are unclear." (Highlights lack of clarity without providing resolution, potentially confusing the audience).
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – While official sources (police statement, resident quote, mother's quote) are used, they are presented as factual reporting of statements, not primarily as an authoritative endorsement of the article's *opinion*.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – "If an average citizen... would be in jail—right now. However, instead... she was simply placed on administrative leave..." (Presents the situation as only two starkly contrasting possibilities based solely on citizen vs. police status).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" or "just the way things are" that shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – The entire embedded poll section ("Who should replace Nikki Haley...") is irrelevant to the story about the police shooting and distracts the reader.
17. **Straw men – No** – The article does not misrepresent or refute an argument not actually made by an opponent.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The article focuses on this specific incident and its critique of police treatment; it does not accuse critics of hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated issues.

**Verdict – 50% –** The text reports a factual event (an off-duty officer killing a homeowner after entering the wrong apartment) but employs several propaganda techniques to frame the narrative and persuade the reader towards a specific viewpoint (criticism of police accountability and "blue privilege"). Techniques like **Loaded Language**, **Exaggeration**, **Name Calling** ("blue privilege"), **Appeal to Fear**, **Doubt**, **Causal Oversimplification**, **Black & White Fallacy**, and **Obfuscation** are used to evoke strong emotions (outrage, fear, sympathy) and present a simplified, biased interpretation of the event and its implications for law enforcement. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant **Red Herring** (the Nikki Haley poll) is a strong propaganda tactic. However, the core event is real and reported with factual details from official sources, preventing a higher propaganda likelihood. The purpose is clearly to persuade as much as (or more than) to inform objectively.
