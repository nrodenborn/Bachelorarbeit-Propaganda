Here's the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "authorities have so far done everything in their power to **cover-up**", "authorities have **lied** to the American people". These are insulting labels directed at authorities.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The phrase "active shooter" is repeated numerous times (e.g., "active shooter targeting", "active shooter situation", "incident with an active shooter", "active shooter inside the Bellagio Hotel"). The location "Bellagio" is also repeated frequently.
3.  **Slogans** – No – While phrases like "Slowly but surely" are used, there isn't a single, brief, memorable phrase acting as a central slogan in this specific text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The entire text is built on instilling fear: fear that the government is lying about a major terrorist attack ("worst mass shooting"), fear that there were multiple shooters targeting different hotels, and fear of an ongoing cover-up. This is used to support the idea that the official story is false.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "contradicts the official story", "authorities have so far done everything in their power to cover-up", "police and the FBI has hidden from the American people", "authorities have lied to the American people", "One can only speculate as to what the reasons for these lies actually are?" – These all directly question the credibility and honesty of authorities.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes (Exaggeration) – "completely destroyed" (regarding the official narrative) is an exaggeration. "Strikingly obvious" also overstates the presented evidence. Minimization isn't prominent.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There's no explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity. The focus is on authorities lying, not on national pride.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like "astonishing", "confessional", "reveal", "cover-up", "hidden", "Amazingly", "completely destroyed", "strikingly obvious", "lied" are emotionally charged and designed to evoke outrage and suspicion.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups is made to disapprove an idea.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "This testimony also backs up claims by another eyewitness", "Slowly but surely we are starting to see..." – This implies growing consensus and encourages the reader to join the side uncovering the "truth".
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text presents the discrepancies in eyewitness reports and police audio solely as proof of a deliberate government cover-up ("authorities have lied", "done everything in their power to cover-up"), ignoring other potential explanations (e.g., chaos, miscommunication, investigation complexities).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – While the claims are dramatic, the text is relatively clear about *what* it is alleging (multiple shooters, cover-up at Bellagio). It doesn't rely on deliberately obscure language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – The appeal is to *eyewitnesses* (Jeff, Rene Downs) and a commentator (Shepard Ambellas), not to a recognized authority figure or institution. In fact, it attacks established authorities (police, FBI).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text frames the situation as a binary choice: either the official narrative is true, or authorities are deliberately lying and covering up multiple shooters ("authorities have lied", "cover-up"). It dismisses nuances like incomplete information or investigative errors.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Slowly but surely we are starting to see the official narrative... be completely destroyed" functions as a thought-terminating cliché. It shuts down critical examination by declaring the matter settled and the official story "destroyed" based on the presented claims.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the claim of a Bellagio shooter and the alleged cover-up. It doesn't introduce an obviously irrelevant topic to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text doesn't misrepresent an opposing argument and then refute that misrepresentation. It directly attacks the official story as a lie/cover-up.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse its opponents (authorities) of hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions or unrelated wrongdoings.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its primary function is not to neutrally report facts but to aggressively promote a specific, highly controversial narrative (a government cover-up of multiple shooters) and discredit official sources. Key indicators include: heavy use of **Loaded Language** to evoke outrage, repeated **Appeal to Fear** regarding government deceit and public safety, instilling **Doubt** about authorities, employing the **Bandwagon** effect with other witnesses, **Causal Oversimplification** by attributing discrepancies solely to malice, the **Black & white fallacy** of "official story vs. deliberate lie", and the **Thought-terminating cliché** declaring the official narrative "destroyed". While it presents eyewitness claims and references police audio, the framing, selective emphasis, and manipulative language overwhelmingly serve a persuasive and agenda-driven purpose characteristic of propaganda. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of specific claims (eyewitness testimony, police audio reference) but the overall presentation is heavily slanted.
