1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the media as “The enemedia,” which is an insulting label suggesting they are an enemy.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses short, impactful phrases like “It was a jihad training camp” and “Raising an army for jihad slaughter” to frame the story in a simple, memorable way.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses phrases like “jihad slaughter” and “killing non-believers on behalf of Allah” to create fear about the group and, by extension, the perceived threat of radical Islam.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the media’s credibility by stating, “The enemedia is scrubbing and censoring this story”.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggerated language like “jihad slaughter” to describe the alleged training. It also minimizes the defense’s argument by reducing it to a simple claim of “islamophobia” without deeper engagement.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not explicitly appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its case.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like “jihad slaughter,” “squalid,” and “enemedia” that are designed to evoke strong negative emotions and rely on stereotypes.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its ideas are popular or that the reader should agree because everyone else does. In fact, it suggests its view is being suppressed.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex legal case and the motivations of the individuals involved down to a single cause: a plan for “jihad slaughter.” It also oversimplifies the defense’s position as merely a claim of “islamophobia.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text’s message is direct and clear, not intentionally vague or confusing.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly cites an “FBI special agent” and an “affidavit” to lend credibility to its claims and frame its narrative as fact-based, even though these sources are embedded within highly biased commentary.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a simple binary: the group was either a “jihad training camp” as the author asserts, or they were innocent people being persecuted for their religion (“islamophobia”), leaving no room for nuance or other interpretations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “There it is” is used after presenting the defense’s argument to dismiss it and discourage any further consideration of its merits.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll asking “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is completely irrelevant to the article’s topic and serves as a distraction and likely a data-collection tool.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text simplifies the defense’s position into a weak argument of “‘freedom of religion,’ calling this prosecution ‘islamophobia.’” This is an oversimplified and easily dismissible version of what would be a complex legal defense, making it a straw man.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text attacks its opponents directly but does not use the technique of deflecting criticism by accusing them of hypocrisy on other matters.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it is built around factual elements from an FBI affidavit and a Reuters report, these facts are framed by a significant amount of commentary that employs a wide array of propaganda techniques. The primary goal is not to objectively inform the reader about the case, but to persuade them to adopt a specific, fearful viewpoint. This is achieved through the heavy use of loaded language ("jihad slaughter"), name-calling ("enemedia"), and appeals to fear. The author constructs a simple, good-versus-evil narrative using a black & white fallacy, dismisses opposing views with straw man arguments and thought-terminating clichés ("There it is."), and casts doubt on the credibility of mainstream sources. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring poll further demonstrates that the article's purpose extends beyond journalism into persuasion and audience engagement for a specific agenda. The combination of these techniques shows a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions rather than to encourage critical thought.
