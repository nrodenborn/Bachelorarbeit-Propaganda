### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "killer cop" (used to describe Amber Guyger)  
2. **Repetition** – No – No significant repetition of identical phrases beyond the poll question (which is external content).  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, rallying phrases (e.g., "Justice for Botham" is absent).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – Focuses on outrage, not fear of future threats.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Challenges Chief Hall’s credibility: *"experts say this is not true"* and *"Chief Hall might not have been well informed on the law."*  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes Hall’s justification: *"Exactly what ‘investigative process’ needs to happen... remains unclear"*; maximizes Jean’s virtue: *"innocent, pillar of society."*  
7. **Flag-waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or group identity.  
8. **Loaded language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms: *"cold-blooded killing," "proven to be a threat to society," "different set of rules."*  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis/hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – References public demand: *"citizens call for justice,"* and precedents (Wilburn/Spencer firings) to imply consensus.  
11. **Causal oversimplification** – Yes – Reduces lack of firing solely to double standards: *"Amber Guyger is subject to a different set of rules."*  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – The text clarifies contradictions (e.g., citing department rules vs. Hall’s claims).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Uses "civil rights attorney Justin Moore" and WFAA’s reporting to debunk Hall.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents firing as the only moral option: *"she has already proven that she is no longer fit for duty, ever again."*  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases halting debate (e.g., "case closed").  
16. **Red herring** – No – All examples (Wilburn, Spencer) directly support the firing argument.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Hall’s stance is accurately quoted and dissected.  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Uses past firings to accuse hypocrisy: *"Lots of cops... have been fired... This includes cops within the Dallas police department"* (Wilburn/Spencer cases).

### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of persuasive techniques to advance a specific narrative. Key indicators:  
- **Biased framing**: Loaded language (e.g., "killer cop," "cold-blooded killing") and minimization of counterarguments paint Guyger and the department as unequivocally guilty, bypassing neutral reporting.  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Repeated emphasis on Jean’s innocence and Guyger’s privilege ("different set of rules") fuels outrage, not objective analysis.  
- **Selective evidence**: Precedents (Wilburn/Spencer) are cited to imply hypocrisy, while omitting potential complexities in Guyger’s case (e.g., ongoing investigations).  
- **Fallacious reasoning**: Black-and-white framing ("should be fired") and causal oversimplification (attributing inaction solely to bias) dismiss procedural nuances.  
- **Agenda-driven structure**: The article is sourced from *The Free Thought Project* (a known libertarian/anti-establishment outlet), and the poll distraction underscores activist intent.  

However, it avoids outright falsehoods by anchoring claims in verifiable reports (WFAA, direct quotes). This prevents a 100% rating but still aligns with propaganda’s core function: to persuade, not inform, by prioritizing emotional impact over balanced discourse.
