Name calling – No – The text does not use any insulting labels to attack a person, group, or object.

Repetition – No – While the topic of the solar storm is mentioned multiple times, the text does not repeat a specific propagandistic message or phrase to reinforce an idea.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote a cause or idea.

Appeal to fear – Yes – "A gird failure would almost immediately fling the United States into a state of panic, and it’s always good to be prepared just in case."

Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or source; in fact, it relies on sources like NOAA and NASA to build its own credibility.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the storm's power by calling it "minor" and a "glancing blow," but exaggerates the potential consequences with the phrase "fling the United States into a state of panic."

Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions the United States as a geographical location but does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "havoc" and "panic" to describe potential outcomes, for example: "it could still cause some havoc down on Earth."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text makes no comparisons to hated groups like the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest the reader should adopt a viewpoint because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text provides a simplified but scientifically-based explanation for the solar storm, rather than attributing a complex event to a single, simple cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text aims to explain the phenomenon to a general audience and clarifies technical terms. It is not deliberately unclear.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the credibility of official sources as evidence for its claims: "The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts...", "According to Seeker...", and "NASA stated...".

Black & white fallacy – No – The text presents a range of possible outcomes (a light show, weak fluctuations, satellite impact, unlikely grid failure) rather than only two extreme options.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "it’s always good to be prepared just in case" is used to end discussion on the topic of risk without critical examination.

Red herring – No – The text stays on the topic of the solar storm and its effects without introducing irrelevant material to distract the reader.

Straw men – No – The text does not create and then refute a false argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any party of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 25% – The text uses several propaganda techniques, primarily Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language, and Exaggeration. These are employed to sensationalize a relatively minor scientific event, likely to generate more reader interest and clicks (a practice often called "clickbait"). However, the piece lacks a strong, clear ideological or political agenda that is the hallmark of true propaganda. It also grounds its claims in scientific sources (Appeal to Authority) and repeatedly clarifies that the risk of serious damage is low. Therefore, while it borrows tools from the propaganda playbook for sensationalism, it functions more as low-quality journalism than as a dedicated propaganda piece.
