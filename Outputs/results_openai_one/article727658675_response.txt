Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, bandwagon, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These elements suggest a moderate likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it uses emotional and authoritative appeals to persuade the audience regarding the sanctity of marriage and the perceived threat of certain pastoral norms. However, it does not employ all possible techniques, and the presence of factual information and quotes from authoritative figures adds some balance to the text.
