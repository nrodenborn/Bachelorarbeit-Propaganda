### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 40% –**  
**Explanation:**  
The text contains some elements of propaganda, particularly in the use of loaded language, exaggeration/minimization, doubt, and some intentional vagueness. These techniques are present in the way accusations are framed and in the emotionally charged descriptions of the election process. However, the majority of the text is straightforward reporting, quoting both sides and providing factual information about the events and statements made by the parties involved. The presence of some propaganda techniques suggests a moderate likelihood (40%) that the text is propaganda, but it is not overtly or heavily propagandistic. The article leans more toward biased reporting than outright propaganda.
