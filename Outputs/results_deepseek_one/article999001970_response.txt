Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "snowflakes" (used to insult the Columbia students/critics), "Comrades" (used mockingly to imply the organizers are authoritarian like communists).
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: No specific phrase or message is repeated significantly throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable, rallying phrase is used (like "Build the Wall").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Also the Left killed comedy. This is what its corpse looks like." instills fear that comedy/speech is being destroyed by a specific ideology.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: "I can't imagine what they would have made of Richard Pryor, or at this point even, Chris Rock." questions the legitimacy/criteria of the critics by implying they couldn't handle universally respected comedians.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: "This is what its corpse looks like." (exaggerates the state of comedy); "Patel is 32. I'm sure Patel felt very, like, accepted." (minimizes the age difference/generational conflict and mocks the concept of acceptance).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: No appeal to patriotism, national identity, or a specific group identity (like "We the People") is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: "social justice crybullying", "corpse", "snowflakes", "Comrades", "thought crimes" are all emotionally charged words/phrases designed to evoke strong negative reactions and employ stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: While "Comrades" hints at communism, it doesn't specifically invoke Nazis, Hitler, or universally hated groups like the Nazis/Vichy to discredit the opponents' position.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text doesn't argue that an idea is correct or should be adopted simply because it's popular.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Also the Left killed comedy. This is what its corpse looks like." attributes the complex issues of comedy, free speech, and sensitivity on campus solely to "the Left" in an overly simplistic way.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is opinionated but generally clear about its points. Terms like "the Left" and "social justice crybullying" are loaded but not deliberately obscure or vague in context.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: References to Richard Pryor, Chris Rock, and Sammy Davis Jr. are used implicitly as authorities on comedy/edginess to support the author's defense of Patel and criticism of the students ("I can't imagine what they would have made of Richard Pryor...", "It's also a version of a Sammy Davis Jr joke...").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: The contrast between "the real world" (presented as tough, unvarnished truth) and "Columbia" (presented as an artificial, oversensitive bubble) frames the situation as only having these two opposing, simplistic options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Comrades, these jokes you have been listening to are thought crimes!" uses a loaded cliché ("thought crimes") to mock the critics and shut down discussion about the actual content/impact of the jokes.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: Introducing the examples of Richard Pryor, Chris Rock, and Sammy Davis Jr. distracts from evaluating Patel's specific jokes and the specific reaction at Columbia by shifting focus to how *other* comedians would supposedly be treated.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Comrades, these jokes you have been listening to are thought crimes!" misrepresents the critics' position (who objected to specific jokes as racist/homophobic) as labeling them "thought crimes," a much more extreme and authoritarian concept.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Explanation: "I can't imagine what they would have made of Richard Pryor, or at this point even, Chris Rock." deflects criticism of Patel's jokes by pointing to other comedians (implying hypocrisy or inconsistency in standards).

**Verdict – 85% –** Explanation: The text exhibits a high concentration of identifiable propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-Terminating Clichés, Red Herring, Straw Men, Whataboutism). Its primary goal is not simply to report the event at Columbia, but to aggressively promote a specific, highly slanted interpretation: that the incident exemplifies "the Left" killing comedy through oversensitive "crybullying" and censorship ("snowflakes", "thought crimes"). It uses emotionally charged language, fallacious reasoning, misrepresentation, and appeals to authority to persuade the reader towards this viewpoint and against the students/organizers involved. While based on a real event, the framing, selective emphasis, and consistent use of persuasive/attacking techniques align strongly with the purpose of propaganda – advancing a particular agenda and shaping perception. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the core event is factual, but the overwhelming presentation is propagandistic.
