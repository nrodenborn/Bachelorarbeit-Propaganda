Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – Explanation: The text labels Hafiz Kazi as a "terrorist" ("Travis Air Force Base terrorist identified") and associates him with "another jihad terror attack" before authorities have determined a motive (as stated in the article: "Authorities... are analyzing... to try and see if it could help point to a motive," "information gathered so far still does not point to a concrete motive").
2.  **Repetition – No** – Explanation: No specific phrase or core message is repeated insistently throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans – No** – Explanation: There are no brief, memorable, rallying phrases used in the text itself (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL!" is quoted but as an example definition, not used here).
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Explanation: The text instills fear by claiming officials prioritize "Protecting the image of Islam" over "protecting the public," suggesting an imminent threat from both the attacker and the authorities' inaction.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – Explanation: The text explicitly questions the motives of officials ("Why?", "They wanted to hold off...", "Protecting the image of Islam, not protecting the public, still seems to be the most important priority..."), casting doubt on their actions and priorities.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Explanation: The text exaggerates by definitively labeling the incident "another jihad terror attack" ("identifying this terrorist as another Muslim, and this as another jihad terror attack") based on the driver's name/religion alone, before any evidence of motive is presented (authorities state no concrete motive is known and are investigating all possibilities). It minimizes the complexity of the investigation and the authorities' stated reasons for withholding information initially.
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – Explanation: While the setting (military base) and mention of "public" safety could evoke patriotism, the text does not explicitly appeal to patriotism or national identity as a core argument technique.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Explanation: The text uses highly charged, negative, and prejudicial language like "terrorist," "another Muslim," "jihad terror attack," "Protecting the image of Islam," implying nefarious motives without evidence. Words like "blew up," "breaching security gates," and "deliberately" also heighten emotional impact.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – Explanation: The text does not attempt to link its opponents or their actions to Nazism or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – Explanation: The text does not argue that its viewpoint is correct because it is popular or gaining support.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Explanation: The text reduces the complex event (a car explosion at a base with an unknown motive) to a simple cause: Islamic terrorism ("another Muslim," "another jihad terror attack"), ignoring the investigation's findings that no concrete motive was known and all possibilities (including mental health) were being considered.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – Explanation: The text is direct and accusatory, not deliberately vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Explanation: The text concludes by appealing to the authority of Pamela Geller ("Article posted with permission from Pamela Geller," "Pamela Geller's commitment to freedom from jihad and Shariah shines forth..."), implying her endorsement lends credibility to the article's claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Explanation: The text presents the officials' actions as a stark choice between only two options: "Protecting the image of Islam" or "protecting the public," ignoring legitimate investigative or procedural reasons for withholding information initially.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – Explanation: The text doesn't employ phrases designed to shut down critical thinking (e.g., "it is what it is"). Its assertions are presented as conclusions to be accepted, but not via clichés.
16. **Red herring – No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the incident and the accusation against officials. It doesn't introduce a significantly irrelevant topic to distract.
17. **Straw men – No** – Explanation: The text does not misrepresent an opposing argument to make it easier to attack. It directly attacks the officials' actions as it perceives them.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – Explanation: The text does not accuse its opponents (the officials) of hypocrisy by pointing to their other actions.

**Verdict – 95% –** Explanation: The text exhibits a high concentration of recognized propaganda techniques. It definitively labels the driver a "Muslim terrorist" responsible for a "jihad terror attack" (Name Calling, Exaggeration, Causal Oversimplification, Loaded Language) based solely on his name and religion, ignoring the authorities' explicit statement that no motive was known and all possibilities were being investigated. It heavily implies a conspiracy by officials to hide this purported Islamic motive to protect Islam's image rather than the public (Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Black & White Fallacy). The inclusion and endorsement of Pamela Geller, a known controversial figure with strong anti-Islam views, reinforces the biased perspective (Appeal to Authority). The core message is driven by prejudice, fear-mongering, and the dismissal of factual complexity in favor of a predetermined narrative centered on Islamic extremism as the sole explanation. While it reports some basic facts from the ABC News report, the framing, language, conclusions, and endorsement overwhelmingly push a specific, unsubstantiated, and inflammatory agenda characteristic of propaganda.
