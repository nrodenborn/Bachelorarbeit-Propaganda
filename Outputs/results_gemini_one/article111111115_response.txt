Name calling – No – The text uses descriptive terms like "sexual misconduct accusations" to categorize the events, but it does not use insulting labels to attack any individual.

Repetition – No – The text lists multiple, distinct accusations. It does not repeat the same message or phrase to reinforce a point.

Slogans – No – The text is a news report and does not contain any brief, memorable phrases intended as slogans.

Appeal to fear – No – The text reports on past events and does not attempt to instill fear about future consequences or alternative ideas.

Doubt – No – The text reports that Sen. Franken denied or questioned the allegations ("he remembered the skit incident differently," "called the allegation 'categorically not true'"). However, the article itself is not casting doubt; it is reporting the facts of his response.

Exaggeration/minimization – No – The article lists the accusations and responses without using language that exaggerates or minimizes their significance.

Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions the "USO tour" and Franken's role as a "senator," but these are factual details for context and are not used to appeal to patriotism.

Loaded Language – No – While the descriptions of the accusations contain emotionally charged words ("groped," "forcibly kissed"), these are direct reports of the allegations themselves, not the author's framing. The article's own language is neutral and descriptive.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text reports that "About 30 Senate Democrats... have urged the Minnesota Democrat to step down," which describes a bandwagon effect. However, the text itself is not using this fact to persuade the reader to join in, but rather to provide context for his resignation.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not offer any cause-and-effect analysis; it simply lists the accusations.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is specific, detailing each accusation, the source, the approximate date, and the response. It is the opposite of vague.

Appeal to authority – No – The text mentions authorities (senators, elected officials) as subjects of the news story, not as evidence to support a claim.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text presents a range of accusations and a variety of responses from Franken, not a simple two-sided choice.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases that discourage critical thought.

Red herring – No – All information presented is directly relevant to the topic of the sexual misconduct accusations against Sen. Franken.

Straw men – No – The text does not create or refute any misrepresented arguments. It reports on direct accusations and direct responses.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge any party with hypocrisy or deflect from the topic at hand.

Verdict – 5% – The text is a piece of informative news reporting, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the public by systematically listing a series of factual allegations made against a public figure and, where available, that figure's response to each claim. The structure is balanced, and the language is neutral and descriptive. It avoids using the listed propaganda techniques to persuade the audience. Instead, it presents information from multiple sides, leaving the reader to form their own conclusion. The very low percentage accounts for the fact that any presentation of information involves selection, but this text adheres closely to the standards of objective journalism rather than persuasive propaganda.
