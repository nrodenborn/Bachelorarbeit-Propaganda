Here are the propaganda techniques and whether they are used in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – The text repeatedly uses insulting labels to describe the groups and individuals it opposes. Example: "These days it’s instead partnering with Jewish Voice for Peace: an anti-Israel BDS hate group that defends anti-Semitism"
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The text repeats the central message that the American Jewish Historical Society (AJHS) is partnering with an anti-Israel group (JVP). Example: The partnership is mentioned numerous times, such as "the AJHS and JVP partnership", "partnership between AJHS and JVP", and "AJHS’s partnership with JVP".
3.  **Slogans** – No – The author does not use their own brief, memorable phrases to serve as a slogan for their cause.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text suggests a dangerous and escalating threat from a specific group. Example: "The anti-Israel left has built networks that can blacklist, smear and silence almost anyone in an academic field."
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The text consistently works to undermine the credibility and stated motives of the organizations it targets. Example: "Is co-sponsoring events with a hate group that has sponsored talks by a woman who accused Jews of drinking blood also apolitical scholarship?"
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The text exaggerates the nature of an event to fit its narrative. Example: The title, "The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event," exaggerates the purpose of a debate titled “The Balfour Declaration: Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State?”
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – The text appeals to a shared Jewish identity to create an "us vs. them" dynamic. Example: "Either you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews."
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to influence the reader's opinion. Example: "Its perversion by the radical anti-Jewish and anti-Israel left to serve anti-Semitic narratives is tragic."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – The text makes a comparison to Nazi Germany to discredit those it opposes. Example: "When we think about Nazi Germany, we remember those who spoke out. We don’t remember those who were too intimidated and uncertain to rise against anti-Semitism when they saw it and heard it."
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not argue that an idea should be adopted because it is popular; in fact, it argues for standing against a perceived popular trend within certain academic circles.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text attributes complex institutional changes to a single, simple cause. Example: "When we look at what is going on in CJH’s components like the AJHS, the elevation of David N. Myers to head CJH is unsurprising. Myers is a symptom of the problem."
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is direct and specific in its accusations and targets, not vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text presents the author's credentials at the very beginning to establish him as a credible expert on the topic. Example: "Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism."
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text presents a complex issue as having only two possible sides, with no room for nuance. Example: "Either you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews."
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – The text uses phrases that present a conclusion as obvious and not open to discussion. Example: "And it’s no mystery why."
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The text introduces a speculative and emotional point to distract from the main argument. Example: "What would he think if he knew the anti-Israel purposes that CJH is putting his gift to?"
17. **Straw men** – Yes – The text misrepresents the argument of its opponents to make it easier to attack. Example: "The “Jewish Homeland” or “Jewish State” argument is a hook for contending that the Balfour Declaration didn’t endorse Israel, but some sort of Jewish Bantustan within a Muslim country."
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – The text charges an opponent with hypocrisy. Example: "An organization that hands out the Emma Lazarus Award, named after a passionate Zionist, at its posh dinners is hosting attacks on the existence of Israel."

***

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. While it is based on factual events (the existence of the organizations and the scheduling of the events), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint. This is achieved through the extensive and combined use of numerous propaganda techniques. The article employs constant **Name calling** ("hate group," "anti-Semite") and emotionally **Loaded Language** ("perversion," "corruption," "tragic") to frame the subjects in the worst possible light from the outset. It constructs a **Black & white fallacy**, forcing readers into a simplistic choice: "Either you stand with... those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews." This appeal to identity (**Flag-Waving**) is reinforced by an **Appeal to fear**, which warns of powerful networks that "blacklist, smear and silence" opponents, and a **Reduction ad Hitlerum** that compares the situation to the rise of Nazism. The author systematically uses techniques like **Whataboutism** and **Doubt** to portray the targeted Jewish organizations as hypocritical and their motives as sinister. The argument itself relies on **Exaggeration**, **Causal Oversimplification**, and **Straw men** rather than a fair representation of the opponents' positions. An objective report would seek comment from the accused parties, avoid emotionally manipulative language, and present different perspectives fairly. This text does the opposite, functioning as a polemical attack designed to provoke outrage and condemn its targets.
