Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "disgraced former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page" (uses "disgraced" as an insulting label).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated excessively throughout the text.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans (e.g., no equivalents to "Make America Great Again").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text reports actions and criticisms but does not instill fear against alternatives.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Republicans are "hoping the files reveal details about the start of the Russia investigation," implying doubt about the probe's legitimacy.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Schiff calls the order a "clear abuse of power" (potential exaggeration). The text also minimizes the FISA pages: "The 21 pages make up only a small portion."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity are present.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "hamstrung the administration," "disgraced," "bias," "abuse of power," "false narrative," and "narrow self-interest" evoke strong emotions.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on the popularity of the declassification to persuade.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text does not reduce complex events (e.g., the Russia probe) to a single cause.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is specific about documents, timelines, and sources (e.g., "21 pages," "412 pages," "compressed timeline").  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Quotes from officials (e.g., DOJ spokesperson, Schiff) are used to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomies (e.g., "only two options") are presented.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "end of story" are used to halt discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All content relates directly to the declassification order and its implications.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments (e.g., Schiff’s criticism is quoted directly).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no "but what about X?").

**Verdict – 30% –**  
The text exhibits some propaganda techniques (e.g., **loaded language**, **name-calling**, **doubt**, and **appeal to authority**), primarily through quoted statements from polarized figures (e.g., Trump’s team uses "disgraced" for FBI officials, while Schiff uses "abuse of power"). However, the article itself is structured as a neutral news report: it cites sources from both sides (Republicans and Democrats), provides specific details about the documents and process, and avoids overtly persuasive language in the narrative. The presence of multiple perspectives and factual reporting reduces the overall propagandistic intent, though embedded quotes introduce bias. Thus, the likelihood of the text being propaganda is low but not absent due to selective emotional language.
