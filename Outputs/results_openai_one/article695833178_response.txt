### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 95% –**  
The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, obfuscation, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and red herring. These techniques are used to undermine trust in official sources, create suspicion, and emotionally manipulate the reader. The language is sensationalist and designed to provoke distrust and anxiety rather than to inform objectively. The presence of multiple, overlapping propaganda techniques strongly suggests that the text is propaganda, with a very high likelihood (95%).
