Based on the provided definitions and the text "ICE Deports Guatemalan Man Wanted For Assassination":

1.  **Name calling** – **No** – The text uses the legal term "assassination" as defined by Guatemalan law to describe the charge. It does not use an insulting label beyond the factual accusation.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – The core message (deportation of a fugitive) is stated clearly but not repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to encapsulate the message (like "Build the Wall").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – While the crime (assassination) is serious and the individual is described as "a threat to public safety," the text presents this as a factual reason for deportation, not primarily to instill fear about alternatives or inaction. The focus is on the action taken.
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – The text does not question the credibility of anyone involved. It reports the accusations, actions, and statements directly.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – The description of the crime ("fatally shooting," "assassination") and the statistics (1,700 fugitives removed, 240,255 removals) are presented as factual claims without obvious inflation or downplaying.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While the text highlights US-Guatemalan cooperation and frames the deportation as a priority ("ICE top priority"), it does not explicitly appeal to patriotism or national identity (e.g., "making America safe").
8.  **Loaded Language** – **No** – The language is generally neutral and factual. Terms like "foreign fugitives," "threat to public safety," and "serious crimes" are descriptive within the law enforcement context and not overtly emotionally charged or stereotyping in this presentation.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – There are no comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally despised groups to disapprove of anything.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text does not appeal to the popularity of the idea of deportation or suggest others are doing it to encourage joining in.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The text describes a specific deportation action and its rationale (removing a fugitive) without making broad claims about complex problems having single, simple causes.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text provides specific details: the individual's name, the crime, dates (entry, overstay, arrest, deportation), locations, charges, and statistics. It is clear and direct.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The quote from Ricardo Wong, field office director for ERO Chicago, is used to support the importance and priority of the action ("Removing foreign fugitives... is an ICE top priority"). His statement lends official weight to the message.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – The text presents the deportation of this specific individual based on specific charges. It does not present only two stark choices or oversimplify a complex issue into an either/or scenario.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thought (e.g., "It is what it is," "That's just the way things are").
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on the details of this specific deportation case and related statistics about ICE's fugitive removal operations. It does not introduce irrelevant material to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text does not present or refute any opposing arguments or misrepresent a position to make it easier to attack.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not accuse critics or opponents of hypocrisy regarding other issues to deflect from the subject.

**Verdict – 10% –** The text reads primarily as a straightforward law enforcement press release or news report. Its core purpose is to inform about a specific deportation action and provide context about ICE's fugitive removal operations. The inclusion of the ICE official's statement ("Appeal to authority") is standard practice in such releases to provide institutional perspective and frames the action positively, representing the agency's viewpoint. While this framing could be seen as a mild form of institutional promotion (hence the 10%), it lacks the defining characteristics of propaganda: there's no discernible attempt to deceive, manipulate emotions excessively, employ misleading techniques, or promote a broader ideological agenda beyond standard law enforcement public relations. The information presented (names, dates, charges, statistics) is specific and factual within the context of official actions and statements.
