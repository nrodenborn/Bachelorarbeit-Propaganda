1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the subjects of the ICE raid as “illegal alien criminals” and “rapists and child sex offenders.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The central idea that the mayor “tipped off” criminals or warned about the raid is repeated throughout the text in various forms to reinforce the message.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases designed to be repeated as a rallying cry.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states that the mayor’s actions resulted in “rapists and child sex offenders escaping arrest,” which instills fear in the reader about dangerous criminals being at large.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the mayor’s credibility by highlighting that “Schaaf refuses to say how she learned about the ICE raids” and speculating about her sources.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the consequences of the mayor's actions by immediately stating her warning resulted in “rapists and child sex offenders escaping arrest,” a specific and highly inflammatory outcome that is not substantiated in the text itself.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity using symbols like the flag.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “illegal alien criminals,” “rapists and child sex offenders,” and “Obama holdovers ensconced in the government” to evoke strong negative emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest that the mayor’s ideas are popular with groups like Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular or that the reader should agree because everyone else does.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause-and-effect: the mayor’s warning directly “result[ed] in rapists and child sex offenders escaping arrest.” This ignores the complexities of law enforcement operations and immigration.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague speculation presented as a near-certainty, such as “it's good odds that it began with Obama holdovers,” to create suspicion without providing concrete evidence.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites its own authority in obtaining documents (“In emails we obtained through a public records request”) and quotes federal law to support its claim that the mayor’s actions were criminal.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text implicitly frames the issue as a choice between supporting law enforcement (ICE) and supporting “illegal alien criminals,” leaving no room for nuanced positions on immigration or mayoral duties.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down discussion.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a detailed section of law about the felony of *hiring* and *harboring* illegal aliens as an employer, then pivots to accuse the mayor of “tipping off criminals committing a felony,” conflating her warning with the specific crime of an employer.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not present or refute a counter-argument from the mayor or her supporters; it solely focuses on its own line of attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism of one party by accusing another of the same or a similar offense.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a neutral report but a piece of persuasive writing designed to condemn the mayor's actions and provoke an emotional response in the reader. This is achieved through a potent combination of techniques. It immediately employs name-calling and an appeal to fear by linking the mayor's warning to "rapists and child sex offenders." It uses loaded language ("illegal alien criminals," "Obama holdovers") to frame the subjects negatively from the start. The piece relies on causal oversimplification and exaggeration to draw a direct, unproven line between the mayor's warning and the escape of dangerous criminals. Furthermore, it uses red herrings (the detailed law about employers) and appeals to its own authority ("emails we obtained") to create a veneer of legal and journalistic legitimacy for its one-sided argument. The sheer number of techniques used in concert demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than to inform them objectively.
