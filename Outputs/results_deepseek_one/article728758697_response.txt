Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "Hitler-Loving Anti-Semite" (headline), "racist hate group leader".
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – "thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people".
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "The media is very interested in racism. Except when it's coming from inside the house." (Repeated theme/accusation).
4.  **Appeal to fear – No** – While the text describes hateful statements (Farrakhan's quotes), it doesn't primarily use fear of consequences to support its own idea. The fear is presented as evidence of Farrakhan's character, not as a direct threat from an alternative.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "It's maintained a solid boycott on reporting...", "Don't count on these comments... to get reported", "The media is happy to talk about anti-Semitism. It just won't address left-wing anti-Semitism and racism." (These cast doubt on the media's motives, fairness, and honesty).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Minimization: "Davis was dismissive and said that many people in politics have a history of inflammatory comments." (This downplays the severity of Farrakhan's specific, extreme anti-Semitism by equating it vaguely with "inflammatory comments" by "many").
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – "Would a Republican get a pass...? Obviously not." (Appeals to partisan identity and loyalty, implying Democrats get special treatment).
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "Hitler-Loving Anti-Semite", "racist hate group leader", "solid boycott", "defended", "racially extreme comments", "inflammatory comments", "get a pass", "happy to talk" (vs. "won't address"). (These words are emotionally charged and carry strong negative connotations).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes** – The entire headline and focus relies on linking Farrakhan (and by association, Davis and Obama) to Hitler and Nazism through Farrakhan's own quotes. The term "pass" implies excusing Nazism/Hitler praise.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – The text doesn't argue that supporting Davis/Farrakhan is popular or that the reader should join a popular cause. It attacks the media for *not* covering it.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – No** – The text doesn't present a simplistic cause for a complex problem.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is direct and accusatory, not vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – No authority figure is cited to support the author's claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – "Would a Republican get a pass on meeting with a racist hate group leader? Obviously not." (Presents only two rigidly opposed options: Republicans *never* get a pass for such things, implying Democrats *always* do).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "He was just saying what most of them think." (This dismisses the need for further discussion or evidence about the views of the Congressional Black Caucus).
16. **Red herring – Yes** – Introducing Obama's meeting with Farrakhan and the CBC's lack of apology distracts from the core subject of Rep. Davis's specific comments defending Farrakhan. The question "Would a Republican get a pass?" also shifts focus away from Davis/Farrakhan.
17. **Straw men – No** – The text attacks the media's actual reported behavior (or lack thereof) regarding Davis and Farrakhan, not a misrepresented version of their argument.
18. **Whataboutism – Yes** – "When asked about Farrakhan’s history of anti-Semitic comments, Davis was dismissive and said that many people in politics have a history of inflammatory comments." (Davis deflects by pointing to unspecified others). Also, the entire section comparing to hypothetical Republican treatment ("What about Republicans?") is classic Whataboutism.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely propaganda. It employs numerous propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Doubt, Minimization, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Reduction ad Hitlerum, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating cliché, Red Herring, Whataboutism, Repetition, Slogan) to advance a specific, partisan narrative. Its primary goal is not balanced reporting but to attack Democrats (Rep. Davis, the Congressional Black Caucus, Obama), defend Louis Farrakhan minimally while using his extreme views as a weapon, and, most prominently, discredit the media as biased and hypocritical. The selective presentation of facts (focusing solely on Davis's defense while downplaying Farrakhan's quotes within the argument, emphasizing media non-coverage), heavy use of emotionally charged language, and reliance on logical fallacies to frame the issue all strongly indicate an intent to persuade and manipulate the audience towards a specific political viewpoint rather than inform objectively. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the text includes verifiable facts (Davis's quotes, Farrakhan's quotes) but frames and uses them propagandistically.
