Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text "What Happens After Islamic Conquest?" for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "inhuman barbarians," "savage enemies," "fiercest of wild beasts" used to describe the Muslim conquerors; "gullible Westerners" used to describe the audience the author opposes.
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "arm yourself with the truth" is a brief, memorable phrase urging action (buying the book).
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Descriptions of butchery, abduction, rape, and child-snatching instill fear of the conquerors; the warning against being "fooled" by tales of tolerance aims to instill fear about mass Muslim migration softening Western resistance.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "So much for the much-vaunted Islamic 'tolerance' in Europe" directly questions the credibility of narratives about historical Islamic tolerance, implying they are false; "the tales of which Islamic scholar Akbar Ahmed is using to fool gullible Westerners today" casts doubt on Ahmed's motives and the truthfulness of his message.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Likely Yes (Exaggeration)** – The descriptions ("most inhuman," "most savage," "fiercest of wild beasts," "Men have been butchered like cattle," "virgins ravished") use extreme and emotionally charged language typical of exaggeration, though based on a historical account. Minimization isn't evident.
7.  **Flag-Waving – Indirectly Yes** – Appeals to Western/Christian identity by framing the conquest as an attack on "the Christian faith" and positioning the book as arming "Westerners" against deception threatening their societies.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Pervasive use of emotionally charged and negative terms: "inhuman barbarians," "savage enemies," "wild beasts," "sacked," "consumed," "destroyed," "stripped," "butchered like cattle," "abducted," "ravished," "snatched," "much-vaunted" (used sarcastically), "fool," "gullible," "soften their resistance," "arm yourself."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – The text doesn't attempt to link its opponents (e.g., Akbar Ahmed, proponents of tolerance narratives) to Nazis or universally hated groups explicitly.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – The text doesn't argue for its position based on its popularity. It focuses on historical atrocity and warning against deception.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – No** – The text describes events and a perceived current deception but doesn't explicitly attribute a complex modern issue (like migration) solely to a simple cause like the tolerance narrative.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is direct and uses strong, clear language. Its message is not obscured by vagueness.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – The text heavily relies on quoting the Byzantine scholar Bessarion ("The Byzantine scholar Bessarion wrote...") as an authoritative eyewitness to validate the description of atrocities. It also positions the author's own book ("I detail what happened next") and Robert Spencer (via permission) as sources of authority.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents the conquest solely as an atrocity committed by savage barbarians against innocent Christians, dismissing any counter-narrative of tolerance as a deceptive tale used to "fool" people. It frames the issue as truth (the book, the described atrocities) vs. dangerous deception (tolerance narratives).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "So much for the much-vaunted Islamic 'tolerance' in Europe" dismisses the entire concept of historical Islamic tolerance in Europe as invalid based on this single (though significant) event, discouraging deeper historical analysis. "Arm yourself with the truth" implies the book provides the complete and final answer.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – The entire poll section about Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation is completely irrelevant to the topic of the Islamic conquest of Constantinople or modern migration. Its sole purpose is to distract and capture reader data.
17. **Straw men – Likely Yes** – The text attacks "the much-vaunted Islamic 'tolerance' in Europe," implying this narrative claims universal peace and harmony, which is likely an oversimplification or misrepresentation of the more nuanced historical arguments about periods of relative coexistence or tolerance *in specific contexts* within Islamic-ruled territories. It refutes this oversimplified version.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The text does not accuse its opponents of hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated wrongs they or their side committed. It accuses them of deception regarding a specific historical narrative.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a dense concentration of propaganda techniques: **Name Calling, Loaded Language, and Appeal to Fear** create a highly negative and emotionally charged portrayal of the historical Muslim conquerors and implicitly of modern Muslims/migration. **Repetition** (of the poll) and **Slogans** ("arm yourself with the truth") are used for emphasis and memorability. **Doubt** and the **Black & White Fallacy** are used to discredit opposing historical narratives and present the author's view as the only truth. **Appeal to Authority** (Bessarion, the author's book) provides apparent legitimacy. **Thought-terminating clichés** shut down critical examination of the tolerance narrative. A blatant **Red Herring** (the Kavanaugh poll) distracts the reader for data collection. The core purpose is not balanced historical analysis but to promote a specific, alarmist viewpoint about Islam (historically and contemporarily) and, crucially, to **sell the author's book** ("preordering The History of Jihad... click here"). The permission notice from Robert Spencer, a figure known for controversial views on Islam, further signals the ideological and promotional intent. While based on a historical event, the presentation is deliberately manipulative and one-sided to serve the author's agenda and commercial interest.
