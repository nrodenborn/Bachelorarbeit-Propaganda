1. Name calling – Yes – Explanation: The text repeatedly uses the term "Infidels" to label the non-Muslim victims of attacks, adopting the language of extremists to create an "us vs. them" narrative. Example: "...the jihad death toll so far stands at 218 Infidels, murdered in 53 jihad attacks."
2. Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The core message that Ramadan is a "month of jihad" is stated and restated throughout the piece. Example: "Once again this year we see that Ramadan is quintessentially the month of jihad," and "it would be dangerous, suicidal folly for Infidels to pretend that Ramadan is not the month of jihad." The poll question is also repeated three times.
3. Slogans – Yes – Explanation: The headline "Ramadan Jihad" functions as a short, memorable slogan that encapsulates the article's entire argument, linking a religious observance directly with violence.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation: The text repeatedly warns of death and danger to persuade the reader. Example: "it would be dangerous, suicidal folly for Infidels to pretend that Ramadan is not the month of jihad. And as our Ramadan willful blindness continues, more Infidels will die."
5. Doubt – Yes – Explanation: The text casts doubt on the credibility of official statements about Ramadan by contrasting them with extremist views. Example: "So which is it? Does Ramadan remind us of “the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,” or is Ramadan “a month of calamity everywhere for nonbelievers”?"
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: The text exaggerates the views and actions of a violent minority to represent the entire faith during Ramadan, while minimizing peaceful interpretations. Example: "Murdering infidels thus doesn’t contradict the spirit of Ramadan; it embodies it."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation: The text appeals to American identity by framing the issue as a threat to "the American people" and contrasting extremist views with statements about "the religious tapestry of American life." Example: "Trump was, unfortunately, following the example of his two immediate predecessors when he claimed that 'Ramadan reminds us of the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,' and was severely misleading the American people."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's opinion. Example: The phrase "dangerous, suicidal folly" is used to create a sense of extreme peril and ridicule opposing views.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation: The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis to discredit an idea.
10. Bandwagon – No – Explanation: The text argues against the popular, mainstream view of Ramadan, positioning itself as a contrarian voice rather than appealing to popularity.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: The text presents a simple and direct cause for a complex issue, arguing that the observance of Ramadan itself is the cause of terrorism. Example: "If the Ramadan imperative is to become more devout... [the Muslim] will simultaneously become more... severe against the unbelievers. Murdering infidels thus doesn’t contradict the spirit of Ramadan; it embodies it."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanation: The article's argument is direct, clear, and unambiguous, not vague or intentionally confusing.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation: The text cites extremist groups as authorities on the "true" meaning of Islam to support its claims. Example: "A jihad group explained it back in 2012: 'The month of Ramadan is a month of holy war and death for Allah.'"
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation: The text presents only two extreme options as the only possibilities for understanding Ramadan. Example: "So which is it? Does Ramadan remind us of 'the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,' or is Ramadan 'a month of calamity everywhere for nonbelievers'?"
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – Explanation: The text uses strong assertions and arguments rather than simple, common clichés to end discussion.
16. Red herring – Yes – Explanation: The text introduces a completely irrelevant topic to distract the reader. Example: The poll inserted in the middle of the article, "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?", has no connection to the topic of Ramadan.
17. Straw men – Yes – Explanation: The author misrepresents an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. Example: The author claims Shadi Hamid tried to "absolve the Muslim community of any responsibility," when Hamid's actual point was that Muslims should not be *defined solely* by the actions of terrorists.
18. Whataboutism – No – Explanation: The text criticizes opponents but does not use the specific tactic of deflecting blame by accusing them of hypocrisy on another matter.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and overt piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative, and extreme viewpoint. It achieves this by employing a dense concentration of propaganda techniques, including appeals to fear, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and black-and-white fallacies. The article systematically presents the most violent, extremist interpretations of a religion as its "core beliefs" and "quintessential" nature, while dismissing all other perspectives as dangerously naive. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant political poll (a red herring) further demonstrates that the article's intent is to manipulate a specific audience rather than engage in honest discourse. The sheer number and blatant use of these techniques confirm its nature as propaganda.
