1. Name calling – No – The text does not use name calling. It reports on Louis Farrakhan using name calling (e.g., calling “powerful Jews” his “enemies”), and it reports that organizations have condemned him with labels like “anti-Semitic,” but the author of the text does not use this technique.
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat a specific message to persuade the audience.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use or promote any slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not instill fear to support an idea. It reports on Farrakhan’s “incendiary remarks” but does not use fear as a persuasive tool itself.
5. Doubt – No – The text reports on the criticism and controversy surrounding public figures’ association with Farrakhan, but the article itself does not cast doubt on a person or thing to push an agenda. It reports on the doubt expressed by others.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text uses specific quotes and cites expert estimates on membership numbers (e.g., “tens of thousands,” “could be in the thousands, and there could even be as many as 10,000 followers”), which is the opposite of exaggeration or minimization.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or identity to make its point. It describes the Nation of Islam’s identity-based appeal (e.g., “radical black self love”) but does not use this technique itself.
8. Loaded Language – No – The text reports on the loaded language used by others, such as Farrakhan’s description of Hollywood putting out “filth and degenerate behavior.” The article uses strong but descriptive words like “incendiary,” “bigoted,” and “vile,” but these are used to accurately characterize the direct quotes provided, rather than to manipulate the reader’s emotions without evidence.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not use this technique. It factually reports that Farrakhan himself made a comment about Hitler: “(Among his more infamous comments is his 1984 description of Adolf Hitler as “a very great man.”)” This is reporting on Farrakhan’s own words, not a technique used by the author.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is popular and should be joined. In fact, it details the widespread criticism faced by those who associate with Farrakhan.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text avoids this by exploring the complex reasons why someone like Tamika Mallory might be reluctant to condemn Farrakhan, citing personal history and the role of the Nation of Islam in her life.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is clear, specific, and provides names, dates, and direct quotations to inform the reader.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text quotes academic experts to provide context and analysis. Example: "Edward E. Curtis IV, the author of “Black Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam,” said that while estimates ranged wildly about how many bona fide members belonged to the Nation, he believes that there were tens of thousands of members in the 1960s and early 1970s." This is used journalistically to provide informed context, not to shut down debate.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text presents multiple perspectives, including those of Farrakhan, his critics, academic experts, and associates like Tamika Mallory and Danny Davis, avoiding a simple two-sided presentation.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text is analytical and provides detailed context, which encourages critical thought rather than discouraging it with clichés.
16. Red herring – No – All the information provided, such as the history of the Nation of Islam and the context of the Obama photo, is relevant to the central question of "Why Louis Farrakhan Is Back in the News."
17. Straw men – No – The text is informational and does not construct or refute any arguments that were not presented.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge anyone with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 5% – This text is an informational news article, not a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about a complex and controversial news event by providing background, context, direct quotes, and multiple perspectives. The key distinction is that the article *reports on* propaganda (specifically the rhetoric of Louis Farrakhan) but does not *use* propaganda techniques itself to persuade the audience. For example, it quotes Farrakhan’s use of name-calling and loaded language but does not engage in it. It presents facts, such as Farrakhan’s praise for Hitler, without using them as a reduction ad hitlerum argument of its own. The one technique it employs, Appeal to authority, is used in a standard journalistic fashion to lend credibility and depth to the reporting by citing experts in the field, rather than to demand belief without evidence. The article’s structure—presenting the controversy, giving historical background, quoting all relevant parties (Farrakhan, his critics, his associates, academic experts), and explaining the complexities of the situation—is the hallmark of explanatory journalism, which is the opposite of propaganda.
