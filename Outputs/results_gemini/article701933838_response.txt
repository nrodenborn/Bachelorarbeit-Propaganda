1. Name calling – No – The text uses factual descriptors for the individual ("Guatemalan citizen," "wanted in his home country on charges of homicide") rather than purely insulting labels.
2. Repetition – No – The core message is not repeated excessively beyond the standard structure of a news report (headline, lede, details).
3. Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases or slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text supports ICE’s actions by highlighting that the subject is wanted for "homicide" and that the agency removes fugitives sought for "serious crimes, including kidnapping, rape and murder." This instills fear about the alternative, which is these individuals remaining in the country.
5. Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or entity.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the number of non-criminal removals by focusing on a specific, high statistic: "Ninety-two percent of individuals removed from the interior of the United States had previously been convicted of a criminal offense." This selectively focuses attention on the most justifiable removals, minimizing the 8% who were not.
7. Flag-Waving – No – While the text is about a U.S. government agency, it does not use patriotic language or symbols to appeal to the audience's national pride.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "foreign fugitives" and lists "serious crimes, including kidnapping, rape and murder" to create a strong negative emotional response towards the individuals being removed and a positive one towards the agency's actions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not associate any idea with hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its position is popular or that the reader should agree because many others do.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simplified cause-and-effect narrative: ICE removes dangerous criminals, which makes the country safer. This ignores the vast complexities of immigration, crime, and international law, reducing the issue to a simple "good vs. evil" scenario.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is generally specific, providing names, dates, and statistics. It is not deliberately vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The entire text is an appeal to the authority of ICE itself, as it is an official press release. It presents its own data and actions as justified and factual. It also cites the authority of an "immigration judge" to legitimize the deportation.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text implicitly frames the situation as a binary choice: either ICE removes dangerous criminals, or the public is left in danger. It does not present any other options, nuances, or complexities related to immigration enforcement.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any common clichés intended to stop critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text focuses on the specific case of a man wanted for murder, then introduces broad statistics about "1,700 foreign fugitives" and "240,255 removals." This information, while related, distracts from the single case and serves to bolster the agency's overall image by showcasing large-scale "successes."
17. Straw men – No – The text does not present or refute any counter-arguments.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 85% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it is presented as a factual news release and contains verifiable information (names, dates, specific events), its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the public of the necessity and effectiveness of ICE. It achieves this by carefully selecting a case that is difficult to argue against—the removal of a man wanted for murder—and using it as a vehicle to promote the agency's entire mission. The text employs several propaganda techniques to frame the narrative: it uses loaded language ("foreign fugitives," "serious crimes") and appeals to fear to create an emotional bias; it simplifies the complex issue of immigration into a matter of public safety (causal oversimplification); it uses statistics selectively to minimize less favorable aspects of its work (minimization) and distract from the single case (red herring); and it relies on its own status as a government body to present its case (appeal to authority). This is a form of institutional public relations that functions as propaganda by shaping public opinion through a one-sided and emotionally-driven narrative.
