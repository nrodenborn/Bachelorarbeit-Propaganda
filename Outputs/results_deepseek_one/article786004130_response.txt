Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No. No insulting labels are applied to Guyger, Jean, or other subjects.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes. The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – No. There are no brief, memorable phrases used to promote an idea.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No. The text reports outrage and questions the event but does not use fear to promote a specific alternative course of action or idea.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes. The author explicitly questions the plausibility of Guyger's account: "I have no idea how you can enter an apartment mistakenly. Does Guyger leave her door unlocked?" and "Ok, some of this seems plausible, but I still am left wondering about the door being ajar. Is this something people are prone to do at 10 o'clock at night in Dallas?"
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No. The text reports facts from affidavits and news reports without clear exaggeration or minimization. Skepticism is expressed, but the facts presented aren't inflated or downplayed.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No. There are no appeals to patriotism or national/group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Mildly, but insufficient for a definitive Yes. Words like "outrage" carry emotional weight, but the text primarily reports facts and expresses skepticism rather than heavily relying on emotionally charged language or stereotypes. ("Knowing this provoked outrage across the nation over the weekend.").
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No. No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No. While public outrage is mentioned ("outcry from the community", "provoked outrage across the nation"), it's reported as a fact and not used explicitly to argue that the reader should adopt a position *because* it's popular.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No. The text doesn't attribute the complex event to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No. The text is relatively clear and reports specific details from affidavits and news reports.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No. The text cites sources (affidavits, Dallas News, USA Today) for factual reporting but does not use an authority's support specifically as evidence to endorse a particular viewpoint beyond the facts presented.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No. The text does not present only two extreme options; it reports facts and expresses skepticism.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No. No phrases are used to shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is", "that's just common sense").
16. **Red herring** – **Yes.** The repeated poll about replacing Nikki Haley as UN Ambassador ("Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" x3 and the poll options/opt-in) is entirely irrelevant to the story about Amber Guyger and Botham Jean. It serves as a distraction.
17. **Straw men** – No. The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that wasn't made.
18. **Whataboutism** – No. The text mentions Guyger's prior shooting incident, but this is presented as relevant background information establishing a pattern, not primarily as an accusation of hypocrisy directed at her or the police regarding the current incident. The focus remains on the current case.

**Verdict – 20% –** The text is primarily a factual report on the incident involving Amber Guyger and Botham Jean, incorporating details from official sources (police statements, affidavits) and news reports. It includes relevant background (the 2017 shooting). While it expresses skepticism about Guyger's account ("I have no idea...", wondering about the door), this falls more under commentary or doubt than overt propaganda. The most significant propagandistic element is the **Red Herring** – the intrusive, repeated, and completely irrelevant poll/question about Nikki Haley's replacement. This poll serves no purpose within the news story other than to distract or potentially harvest user data/engagement under the guise of the tragic event. This single element pushes the text slightly towards propaganda, but the core content remains news reporting. Therefore, the likelihood of the text *as a whole* being propaganda is low (20%).
