1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses "cultural Marxism" as an insulting and pejorative label for the ideology it claims has infiltrated public schools.

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times consecutively.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not employ brief, memorable phrases that are repeated to encapsulate an idea.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text opens by linking public schools to a "mass shooting" and later mentions "violence," "mass shooters," and "bullying" to instill fear in parents about the safety of public schools.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on the credibility and effectiveness of public education, stating that "Too many government schools are more concerned with promoting political correctness than ensuring that students receive a good education."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the threat of a specific ideology by claiming "cultural Marxism has infiltrated many schools" and has led to the "dumbing down of public education."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific political identity (libertarianism) by promoting an education that emphasizes "the ideas of liberty" and the "history of liberty."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like "defenseless schoolchildren," "indoctrinating children," "dumbing down," and "hyper-interventionist foreign policy" to evoke strong emotional responses.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by associating it with groups like Nazis or other figures widely hated by the audience.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text creates the impression of a growing movement by stating that the Parkland shooting "prompted many parents to consider homeschooling" and that "Many potential homeschooling parents are concerned."

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue by stating, "The spread of cultural Marxism has contributed to the dumbing down of public education."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The term "cultural Marxism" is used multiple times as a major threat but is never defined, leaving it as a vague and ominous concept for the audience to fear.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The entire article is presented by Ron Paul, a political figure, and promotes his own curriculum. The byline "Article posted with permission from Ron Paul" reinforces his authority on the subject.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark choice between "government schools," which it portrays as violent and ideologically corrupt, and homeschooling (specifically the author's curriculum) as the only rational and safe alternative.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not rely on common, simplistic phrases or clichés to shut down discussion.

16. Red herring – Yes – The embedded poll asking "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is entirely unrelated to the topic of homeschooling and serves to distract and engage the reader on a separate partisan issue.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text creates a caricature of public schools, suggesting they are primarily focused on "indoctrinating children with... left-wing ideologies" rather than education, which is an oversimplified and easily refutable argument.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader by employing a wide range of manipulative techniques. The article systematically builds a narrative of crisis and fear around public schools, using emotionally loaded language ("violence," "defenseless," "indoctrination") and appealing to fear of both physical harm (school shootings) and ideological corruption ("cultural Marxism"). It then presents a black-and-white choice, positioning the author's own commercial product, the Ron Paul Curriculum, as the sole viable solution. The use of an authority figure (Ron Paul), logical fallacies like causal oversimplification and straw men, and a distracting red herring poll all serve to bypass critical reasoning in favor of an emotional and ideological appeal. The text is simultaneously an ideological manifesto and a direct advertisement, a combination that is a hallmark of modern propaganda.
