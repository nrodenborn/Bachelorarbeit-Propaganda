Below is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the provided text, based on the definitions given. Each entry follows the format: "Propaganda technique – Yes or No – Explanation".

### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – Explanation: The text uses the phrase "cramming lies down our throats" to insult authorities, implying they are deceitful and forceful.  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Explanation: The phrase "vanished into thin air" is repeated verbatim to emphasize Campos's disappearance, reinforcing the mystery.  
3. **Slogans** – No – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Build the Wall") are used to summarize the message.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Explanation: The text implies authorities fabricated Campos and the shooting narrative for "political agendas," instilling fear about institutional deceit.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Explanation: The text repeatedly questions Campos's existence (e.g., "Campos didn’t even exist") and the official timeline, undermining credibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Explanation: Exaggeration is used with "vanished into thin air" and "fabricated by the very authorities," amplifying the mystery beyond verified facts.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – Explanation: No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty (e.g., "We the People") are present.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Explanation: Emotionally charged phrases like "cramming lies down our throats" and "mysteriously vanished" evoke anger and suspicion.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or universally hated groups (e.g., "Vichy journalism") appear.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Explanation: No appeal to popularity (e.g., "Time for US to do same") is made; the focus is on isolated inconsistencies.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Explanation: The text does not oversimplify causes; it highlights contradictions (e.g., conflicting timelines) without attributing the event to one factor.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Explanation: Details are specific (e.g., "32nd floor hallway," "UMC Quick Care"); no deliberate vagueness is used to confuse.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Explanation: Sources like Hickey or UMC Quick Care are cited for factual claims, not to validate the core conspiracy narrative.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Explanation: No false dichotomy (e.g., "everyone is guilty") is presented; the text acknowledges ambiguities.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – Explanation: No phrases (e.g., "Marx is the President") are used to shut down debate; questions are raised instead.  
16. **Red herring** – No – Explanation: All details (e.g., Campos's absence from the security registry) directly relate to the disappearance narrative; no irrelevant distractions are introduced.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Explanation: The text addresses actual inconsistencies (e.g., conflicting injury timelines) without misrepresenting authorities' claims.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., "avoided military service") are made against critics or authorities.  

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 80% – Explanation**  
The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques (e.g., Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language) to frame the Campos disappearance as evidence of a government/media conspiracy. It uses emotionally manipulative language ("cramming lies down our throats"), amplifies unverified claims ("vanished into thin air"), and selectively presents facts (e.g., absence from the security registry) to cast doubt on official narratives without providing counter-evidence. While it cites legitimate inconsistencies (e.g., revised timelines), its tone and framing aim to provoke suspicion rather than encourage critical inquiry. The 80% likelihood reflects its heavy reliance on persuasive techniques over balanced reporting, though it stops short of fabricating events outright.
