Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Jim Acosta's behavior as being like a child ("you can't act like a child and keep your pass") and describes the judge's decision as a "frivolous ruling."

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases designed for mass repetition.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The author instills fear about the consequences of the White House's compliance, stating, "I wonder just how dangerous a precedent this sets."

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and competence of the judge ("a federal judge who should know better") and the White House ("a testimony to how little those who represent us know of our Constitution").

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the severity of the situation by suggesting the judge "should be impeached over his frivolous ruling" and calling the ruling "nothing but surreal."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and constitutional principles by opening with "For any constitutionalist..." and repeatedly referencing the Constitution to frame the issue as a defense of American values.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents a loaded choice between "Yes, he should have gotten it back" and "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass," framing the options as either supporting Acosta or supporting proper behavior. It also frames the White House's options as either complying or aggressively rejecting the ruling ("telling Judge Kelly where he can take his ruling"), ignoring other potential responses.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion.

Red herring – No – The text stays focused on the topic of Jim Acosta's press pass and the White House's response without introducing distracting, irrelevant material.

Straw men – No – The text attacks the actual ruling and the people involved directly, rather than misrepresenting their arguments to make them easier to attack.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. It is not a neutral news report but a highly biased opinion piece that uses numerous propaganda techniques to promote a specific political viewpoint. The primary goal is to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of a judge, a specific journalist (Jim Acosta), and a news organization (CNN), while portraying the Trump administration as a victim of an "unconstitutional" ruling. It employs techniques like name-calling ("act like a child"), loaded language ("frivolous ruling," "ridiculous demand"), appeal to fear ("dangerous precedent"), and flag-waving ("For any constitutionalist...") to bypass rational analysis and evoke a strong emotional response. The use of a repetitive, loaded poll and a black & white fallacy further manipulates the reader into siding with the author's viewpoint. The text selectively presents information and frames the entire event in a way that supports its predetermined conclusion, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
