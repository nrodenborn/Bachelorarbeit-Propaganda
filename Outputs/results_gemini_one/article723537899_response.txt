Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack subjects, such as calling the Syrian regime "ruthless" and referring to a pro-interventionist group as the "U.S. War Party." It also quotes others using name-calling, such as Erdogan branding the BSF a "terror army" and Assad calling its members "traitors."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the authority and justification for U.S. military presence and action in Syria. This is done through a series of similarly structured rhetorical questions, such as "by what authority do U.S. forces remain...?", "But who authorized this strategic commitment...?", and "Who sanctioned this commitment to a new army...?"

Slogans – No – The text does not use or create any brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate its message. It quotes a statement from Erdogan, but does not employ slogans as its own technique.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text repeatedly warns of a negative future to instill fear, suggesting that the current U.S. policy will lead to a "clash with the U.S.," a "shooting war with a Syrian army, backed by Russia, Iran, Hezbollah," and a "major U.S. war with no allies but the Kurds."

Doubt – Yes – The text is built around a series of rhetorical questions designed to cast doubt on the credibility and wisdom of U.S. foreign policy. For example: "Does not the Syrian government have a point?" and "Have the American people been had again?"

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes potential U.S. interests in the region by stating, "While our 'allies' and adversaries have vital interests there, we do not." This presents a complex geopolitical issue as one where the U.S. has zero stake, which is a form of minimization.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and the concept of the popular will of the American people. For example: "Again and again, the American people have said they do not want to be dragged into Syria's civil war. Donald Trump won the presidency on a promise of no more unnecessary wars."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses words with strong emotional connotations to influence the reader. Examples include "crushing of ISIS," "mortal peril," "ruthless regime," "blatant attack," and "flagrant violation."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to the Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text appeals to the idea that because many people believe something, it must be true or right. For example: "Again and again, the American people have said they do not want to be dragged into Syria's civil war."

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not propose a simple cause for a complex past event; rather, it argues that the current situation is complex and warns against a simple-minded policy.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's language is direct and his argument is clear. The rhetorical questions are not meant to be vague but to pointedly question U.S. policy.

Appeal to authority – No – While the text quotes figures like Erdogan and Tillerson, it does so to lay out the situation, not to use their authority as evidence to support the author's own conclusion. The author is, in fact, questioning these authorities.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice between non-involvement and a disastrous war, ignoring other potential outcomes or policy options. This is exemplified by the argument that the U.S. has no vital interests, while its adversaries do, simplifying the decision to one of staying for no reason or leaving.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down debate; on the contrary, it uses rhetorical questions to provoke critical thought about the subject.

Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central argument against U.S. intervention in Syria. The reference to the Iraqi Kurds is not a distraction but an analogy used to support the main point.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent an opponent's argument in order to attack it. Instead, it questions the lack of a clear public justification for the U.S. government's policy.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge an opponent with hypocrisy to deflect criticism. The comparison to the war in Afghanistan is used as an example of past failure to argue against a similar future policy, not as a whataboutism.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it is presented as a political commentary and contains factual elements about the situation in Syria, its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, anti-interventionist viewpoint. This is achieved through the heavy and combined use of numerous propaganda techniques, including loaded language, appeal to fear, name-calling, flag-waving, and casting doubt. The article systematically frames the issue in a way that leads to one desired conclusion by asking leading rhetorical questions, minimizing any potential U.S. interests, and creating a sense of an inevitable, looming disaster caused by a "War Party" acting against the will of "the American people." The one-sided presentation and reliance on emotional and persuasive devices over balanced analysis are hallmarks of propaganda.
