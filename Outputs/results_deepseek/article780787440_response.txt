Based on the definitions provided and the text analysis, here is the assessment for each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to any subject. The text reports facts and quotes neutrally.
2. **Repetition** – No – While the topic of abuse is central, no specific phrase or message is repeated excessively to manipulate.
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable persuasive phrases are used. Quotes (e.g., "zero tolerance") are contextual, not deployed as slogans.
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text describes past atrocities but does not use fear to promote an alternative idea or solution.
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of victims' credibility occurs. The text treats abuse claims as factual (e.g., grand jury report details).
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Events are reported factually (e.g., "301 priests," "thousand survivors"). No understatement or overstatement is evident.
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism, Catholic identity, or group loyalty to sway opinion.
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Phrases like "heart-wrenching pain," "atrocities," and "filth" evoke strong emotions, aligning with the technique’s use of charged words.  
   *Example*: "The heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association of ideas/people with hated groups (e.g., Nazis).  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to the popularity of an idea (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Complexity is acknowledged (e.g., John L. Allen’s analysis of structural problems).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Language is clear and specific (e.g., "301 priests," "seventy years").  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – The Pope’s statements are reported but not used as proof; they are balanced with criticism (e.g., O’Gorman’s rebuttal).  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Multiple perspectives are presented (e.g., Pope’s apology, survivor critiques, expert analysis).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases halt critical thought (e.g., open-ended questions remain).  
16. **Red herring** – No – All content is relevant to abuse scandals and Church responses.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Criticisms (e.g., O’Gorman’s) address actual Church actions, not misrepresented positions.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No deflection via accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., focus remains on Church accountability).  

---

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is a factual news report, not propaganda. It neutrally presents:  
1. **Multiple perspectives** (Pope’s apology, survivor critiques like O’Gorman’s, expert analysis from Allen).  
2. **Evidence-based claims** (e.g., Pennsylvania grand jury report, specific timelines).  
3. **Lack of persuasive intent** – It informs rather than manipulates, detailing events without endorsing a specific agenda.  
4. **Critical context** included (e.g., Church’s ongoing structural failures, past controversies in Chile).  
The sole minor exception is emotionally charged language in direct quotes (e.g., "heart-wrenching pain"), but this reflects the gravity of the topic and direct speech, not systemic propagandistic design. Overall, the piece prioritizes journalistic balance and factual reporting.
