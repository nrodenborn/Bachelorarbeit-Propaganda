### Verdict – 25% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is primarily a factual news report quoting Clinton’s interview and Lewinsky’s response. While Clinton employs **minimization** (downplaying private accountability), **thought-terminating clichés** (shutting down reflection), and a **red herring** (distracting with debt), these occur within his personal statements, not as systemic propaganda. The article itself presents balanced perspectives: it includes Lewinsky’s PTSD revelation and #MeToo reflection, countering Clinton’s narrative. Propaganda typically seeks mass influence through coordinated techniques; here, the intent appears to report news, not manipulate. However, Clinton’s rhetorical tactics slightly skew the discourse (25% likelihood), reflecting individual persuasion rather than institutional propaganda.
