**Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as name calling, appeal to fear, exaggeration, loaded language, and causal oversimplification. These elements suggest a high likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it seeks to influence the audience's perception of Facebook and its actions by using emotionally charged language and presenting a one-sided narrative. However, not all techniques are present, and some elements of the text provide factual information, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood.**
