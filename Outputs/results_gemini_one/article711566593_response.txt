Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly labels the defendant with insulting terms such as “criminal illegal,” “career criminal,” and “killer.”

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes that Garcia Zarate is a “Mexican national,” a “seven-time felon,” has been “deported five times,” and is a “criminal illegal,” reinforcing a negative image.

Slogans – Yes – The text ends by re-purposing the well-known slogan “no justice, no peace” to sarcastically comment on the verdict.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that as a result of this verdict and sanctuary city policies, a “career criminal who is not even supposed to be in the country can literally get away with murder in broad daylight,” creating fear for public safety.

Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the defendant’s identity by stating, “Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, or whatever his real name is,” and on the prosecution’s efforts by saying, “the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the outcome by stating the defendant can “literally get away with murder,” and minimizes the defense’s argument as “politically correct nonsense.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national identity by highlighting that the defendant was “funded by American taxpayers” and violated “U.S. immigration law.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like “disgraceful verdict,” “heartbreaking death,” “horrifying,” and “politically correct nonsense” to evoke strong feelings in the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text quotes President Trump’s tweet, “No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration,” suggesting that this anger is a popular and widespread sentiment the reader should share.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents Jeff Sessions’ claim that San Francisco’s “sanctuary city policy ‘led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle’” as a simple cause for a complex event.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its viewpoint and accusations; it does not use vague or confusing language.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites several authorities to support its argument, including “Attorney David Wohl,” “Conservative Ben Shapiro,” “Jeff Sessions,” and “President Trump.”

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the issue as a choice between placing “the safety and security of their communities above the convenience of criminal aliens,” presenting only two opposing options without nuance.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase “politically correct nonsense” to dismiss the defense’s arguments without engaging with them, and quotes “Justice was rendered, but it was not served” to shut down acceptance of the legal verdict.

Red herring – Yes – The text quotes the defense attorney Matt Gonzalez bringing up the investigation into Trump and his administration, which is irrelevant to the verdict of the Steinle case, to distract from criticism.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the defense’s legal arguments about the nature of the shooting (e.g., accidental discharge, ricochet) by framing their entire case as political, summed up by the question “If this was a college student or Swedish kid would he be charged with murder?” and calling it “politically correct nonsense.”

Whataboutism – Yes – The text quotes defense attorney Matt Gonzalez charging the Trump administration with hypocrisy: “Let me just remind them, they are themselves under investigation... so I ask that they reflect on that before they comment or disparage the results of this case.”

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It employs 16 of the 18 listed techniques, often multiple times, to construct a narrative that is intentionally persuasive rather than informative. The article’s primary goal is not to report on the verdict, but to use the verdict as a vehicle to promote a specific political agenda. This is achieved through a relentless use of loaded language (“disgraceful,” “heartbreaking”), name-calling (“criminal illegal,” “killer”), and appeals to fear (one can “literally get away with murder”). It simplifies a complex legal case into a single cause: a failed “sanctuary city policy.” The author strategically uses appeals to authority (quoting Trump, Sessions, Shapiro) to validate their viewpoint while dismissing opposing arguments as “politically correct nonsense” (a thought-terminating cliché and straw man). The entire piece is framed to provoke anger and fear, pushing the reader to conclude that the American legal and political system is failing to protect its citizens from a dangerous, privileged class of “false-documented illegals.” While it reports some factual elements of the case, the selection, framing, and interpretation of these facts are all manipulated to serve a clear propagandistic purpose.
