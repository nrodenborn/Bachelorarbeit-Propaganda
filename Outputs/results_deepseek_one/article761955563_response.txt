### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly propagandistic**. It employs multiple techniques to manipulate emotions and promote a specific agenda:  
- **Fear-mongering**: Portrays Muslims as seeking "total control" and the UK descending into "tyranny."  
- **Bias and distortion**: Presents Tommy Robinson as a martyr ("hero") while omitting context for his legal troubles (e.g., violating court orders). The firefighter’s suspension is framed as religious persecution, ignoring potential workplace conduct violations.  
- **Loaded narratives**: Uses emotionally charged language ("Muslim rape gang," "disgrace") and false equivalences (comparing UK to North Korea).  
- **Irrelevant content**: The poll about "corrupt Democrats" distracts from the UK-focused story.  
- **Repetition and sloganeering**: Reinforces the "Free Tommy" message to galvanize action.  
The text avoids balanced reporting, instead cherry-picking events to advance an anti-Islam, anti-establishment narrative. Its reliance on exaggeration, fear appeals, and oversimplification confirms propaganda intent. The 5% uncertainty stems from factual elements (e.g., the firefighter’s suspension), though these are framed manipulatively.
