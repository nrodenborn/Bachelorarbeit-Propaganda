**Verdict – 10% – The text is primarily a straightforward news report about Gina Haspel’s formal nomination as CIA director. The only possible propaganda technique present is the introduction of doubt regarding the White House’s commitment to the nomination, as critics speculate about the delay. However, this is a minor element and is presented as the opinion of critics rather than as a fact or as the main focus of the article. The overall tone is neutral and factual, with no strong evidence of propaganda.**
