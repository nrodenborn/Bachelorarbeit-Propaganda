Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

**Technique Analysis**  
1. **Name calling** – No. No insulting labels are used against subjects (e.g., patients or officials are described neutrally).  
2. **Repetition** – No. Key messages (e.g., escapes, antibiotic resistance) are mentioned but not excessively repeated.  
3. **Slogans** – No. No brief, memorable phrases are used to summarize the message (e.g., "turning the bones" is descriptive, not a slogan).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes. *Example:* "prompted fears that the plague could spread even further" and warnings of global pandemic if it reaches mainland Africa.  
5. **Doubt** – No. No direct questioning of credibility; sources (Unicef, experts) are cited without undermining them.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes. *Example:* "Black Death" (historically loaded term) and "inevitable" antibiotic resistance amplify severity.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No. No appeals to patriotism or group identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes. *Example:* "shocking report," "forcefully keeping," "much more terrifying," and "overwhelmed" evoke alarm.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No. No association with hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No. No emphasis on popularity to persuade.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No. Complex factors (fear of hospitals, cultural practices, antibiotic overuse) are acknowledged.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No. Language is direct (e.g., specifics about Famidihana tradition and transmission risks).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes. *Example:* Quotes from Unicef’s Jean Benoit Manhes and unnamed "experts/officials" lend credibility.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No. No false dilemmas (e.g., multiple solutions are implied).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No. No phrases stifling debate (e.g., cultural context is explained).  
16. **Red herring** – No. All content relates to plague risks (escapes, burials, antibiotic resistance).  
17. **Straw men** – No. No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No. No accusations of hypocrisy.  

**Verdict – 40% –** The text exhibits elements of propaganda, primarily through **appeal to fear** (pandemic warnings), **loaded language** ("terrifying," "shocking"), and **exaggeration** ("Black Death," inevitable antibiotic resistance). However, it cites credible sources (Unicef, medical experts) and reports factual events (hospital escapes, burial traditions). The sensational framing (headline, dramatic quotes) leans toward propaganda, but the inclusion of verifiable details and context prevents it from being purely manipulative. Overall, it is more sensationalist journalism than systematic propaganda.
