### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "criminal mayors" (used to attack mayors supporting gun control).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are coined or emphasized beyond generic terms like "unconstitutional laws."  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warns that policies "infringe on rights," "side with criminals," and create fear of government overreach (e.g., "violating the Fifth Amendment rights").  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Repeatedly questions credibility: "How any of this is consistent with support for the Second Amendment is anyone's guess."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes gun control effectiveness: "gun violence didn’t go down one bit during the decade of the Clinton/Feinstein assault weapons ban."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to constitutional identity: "the Second Amendment recognizes the right ... given to us by our Creator."  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms like "hypocrisy," "attacking rights," "criminal mayors," and "unconstitutional and unlawful laws."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to the popularity of the author’s stance.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Claims gun laws fail solely because "criminals won’t follow your laws," ignoring other factors.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Arguments are direct, not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites the Second Amendment and "our Creator" as moral/legal authorities.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents gun control as inherently "unconstitutional" and rights-infringing with no middle ground (e.g., "nothing could be further from the truth").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Phrases like "It’s as simple as that" (mocking opponents) and "nothing could be further from the truth" shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Distracts by citing Chicago’s safety record: "If you buy into this, you probably think places like Chicago ... are among the safest places."  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents mayors’ stance as "attacking the Second Amendment head-on" despite their stated support for it.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No direct accusations of hypocrisy targeting individuals (e.g., not contrasting mayors’ policies with personal actions).

### Verdict – 85% –  
**Explanation:** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic, employing at least 12 of the 18 techniques analyzed. It uses **loaded language** ("criminal mayors," "hypocrisy"), **appeals to fear** (rights erosion, government overreach), and **doubt** to discredit opponents. **Repetition** (poll question), **straw men** (misrepresenting mayors’ intent), and **black-and-white framing** (rights vs. tyranny) dominate the narrative. While it cites factual elements (e.g., assault weapon ban statistics), these are minimized or twisted to fit an ideological narrative. Emotional appeals overshadow balanced analysis, and the goal is clearly to persuade readers to reject gun control by framing it as unconstitutional and dangerous. The final comparison to Chicago exemplifies **red herring**, further confirming its persuasive intent over objective discourse. The 15% non-propaganda margin accounts for referencing real policies/quotes, though these are embedded in a heavily biased framework.
