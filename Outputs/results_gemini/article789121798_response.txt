Name calling – Yes – The author labels those making the allegations as “documented liars” and refers to politicians who oppose the nominee as acting “like children.” The accuser is also referred to as a “Trump-hating woman.”

Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – Yes – The text references President Trump’s popular slogan, “Drain the Swamp,” to frame him as an outsider fighting the establishment.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that because of this “pathetic attempt at a smear campaign,” in the future, “people will be that much less likely to believe his accuser” when a “real sex offender” is nominated.

Doubt – Yes – The entire premise of the article is to cast doubt on the accuser’s credibility, questioning the “timing” of the allegation and her political affiliations, stating it’s “far too suspicious to lend it any credibility.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the behavior of politicians, claiming they “kick and scream and lie and pout.” The allegation itself is minimized as an “ambiguous-at-best claim” and a “pathetic attempt at a smear campaign.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The author appeals to a specific American identity by framing their perspective as that of “an outsider, a regular Joe American,” contrasting it with the “Washington establishment.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “documented liars,” “pathetic attempt at a smear campaign,” and describes a woman as having “crawls out from a line of protesters” to evoke negative emotions in the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or the Nazi party.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that President Trump’s growing popularity is evidence of his correctness, stating that when Congress continues to behave like this, “he only gets more popular.”

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex motivations and circumstances behind the sexual assault allegation to a single, simple cause: a political plot by Democrats to “delay the confirmation until after the election.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s language is direct and not deliberately unclear; they are presenting a very specific and clear (though biased) narrative.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the authority of the FBI, stating the nominee “has been investigated by the FBI six times prior,” and cites “75 women publicly vouching for his character” as evidence against the allegation.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a simple binary: the Republicans who will all vote “Yes” versus the Democrats who will all vote “No.” It frames the conflict as a righteous Trump appointee versus a purely political "smear campaign," ignoring any other possible interpretations or complexities.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text concludes a highly biased interpretation of events with the phrase, “These are the facts. This is not my opinion. Everything else is just noise,” which is a classic technique to shut down critical thought or disagreement.

Red herring – Yes – The embedded poll asking “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is entirely irrelevant to the article’s topic of the Supreme Court nomination and serves as a distraction.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the opposing viewpoint by stating, “Ladies, you demand to be believed, no matter what.” This is an oversimplified and inaccurate caricature of the argument for taking sexual assault allegations seriously.

Whataboutism – No – While the text is highly critical of the opposition, it does not deflect a specific charge of hypocrisy by pointing to a similar fault in an opponent. The attacks are direct rather than diversionary.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint by employing a vast array of manipulative techniques. The piece systematically uses 15 of the 18 listed propaganda methods.

It relies heavily on emotional manipulation through **Name Calling** (“documented liars”), **Loaded Language** (“smear campaign”), and **Appeal to Fear** (warning that real sex offenders will get away with crimes). It constructs a simplified, fallacious argument using the **Black & White Fallacy** to create an "us vs. them" narrative, **Causal Oversimplification** to present a complex event as a simple political plot, and a **Straw Man** to easily discredit the opposing side's position.

The author attempts to establish their own credibility through **Flag-Waving** (“a regular Joe American”) while simultaneously using **Doubt** to dismantle the credibility of the accuser. The argument is sealed with a **Thought-Terminating Cliché** (“These are the facts... Everything else is just noise”) designed to shut down any further discussion or critical analysis. The complete abandonment of objectivity in favor of emotional persuasion and logical fallacies makes this text a textbook case of propaganda.
