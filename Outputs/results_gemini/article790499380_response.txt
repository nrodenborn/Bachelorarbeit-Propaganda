15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés intended to shut down discussion.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text includes a completely irrelevant poll about Nikki Haley's replacement, which serves to distract the reader and gather user information.

For example: "Well, unlike Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Rep. Keith Ellison... has not stood before a committee to deny or address accusations against him."

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a large number of propaganda techniques (11 out of 18) to construct a biased and manipulative narrative. The primary goal is not to inform the reader objectively about the allegations against Keith Ellison, but to discredit him and the Democratic party. This is achieved through prominent use of Whataboutism (constantly framing the issue against the Brett Kavanaugh case), Name Calling ("effeminate pansy"), Loaded Language ("pure hell"), and a Black & White Fallacy that portrays Ellison as a coward and Kavanaugh as brave. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant Red Herring poll further underscores that the article's purpose extends beyond journalism into persuasion and data collection. While it incorporates factual elements like quotes and news reports, they are selectively framed to support a one-sided, negative conclusion.
