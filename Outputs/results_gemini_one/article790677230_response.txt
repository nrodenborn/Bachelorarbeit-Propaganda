1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Democrats and their actions with insulting terms, such as "desperate Democrats," "underhanded tactics," "character assassination," "search and destroy strategy," and calls the process a "total sham" and a "national disgrace." It also refers to "porn star lawyers."

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly pushes the message that the confirmation process was a politically motivated attack by Democrats. This idea is phrased in various ways throughout the article, such as "underhanded tactics employed by the Left," "Democrats’ search and destroy strategy is disgraceful," "a new tactic was needed," and "the most unethical sham since I've been in politics."

3. Slogans – Yes – The text highlights brief, memorable, and action-oriented phrases from its quoted subjects. For example, President Trump’s tweet ends with the capitalized call to action, “The Senate must vote!”

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses quotes to instill fear about the motives and potential power of the opposition. For example, Sen. Lindsey Graham is quoted shouting at the Democrats, “Boy, you all want power. God, I hope you never get it.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The text consistently works to create doubt about Christine Blasey Ford's credibility. It describes her as an "attempted rape accuser," refers to her "ridiculous overall story," calls her testimony "vague and sometimes evasive," and highlights that "everyone she says was present at the alleged incident--even her best friend--has denied it.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates Kavanaugh's performance, calling it "outstanding" and saying he "stole the show." It also exaggerates the Democrats' actions, calling the process the "most unethical sham" and a "national disgrace." Conversely, it minimizes the questions from supportive senators by calling them "softballs."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to national identity and patriotism to build its case. Examples include President Trump's quote, “Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him,” and Sen. Graham's plea, “I hope the American people can see through this sham.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to influence the reader's perception. Examples include "embattled nomination," "righteous indignation," "plotting against him," "last-minute smears," "sordid behavior," and "despicable thing."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text makes negative comparisons to the confirmations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas, but it does not compare any person or idea to the Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests a shift in popular opinion to encourage the reader to join the "correct" side. It notes that commentators who were initially doubtful "were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later," implying a bandwagon effect in favor of Kavanaugh.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex event by framing the entire controversy as a singular "search and destroy strategy" by Democrats designed to "hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020," ignoring any other potential motivations or complexities.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague or obscure. It is direct and forceful in its language and presents a very clear, albeit one-sided, point of view.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on quotes from authority figures who support its narrative, such as President Trump, Sen. Lindsey Graham, Sen. Orrin Hatch, and Sen. Chuck Grassley, using their positions to lend weight to the article's claims.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a two-sided conflict with no middle ground: either you support the honest and wronged Kavanaugh, or you support the "despicable" and politically-motivated "sham" perpetrated by the Democrats. Sen. Graham's quote exemplifies this: "if you vote no, you're legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics."

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down discussion. Instead, it uses strong, emotional accusations and labels to achieve a similar effect, which is better categorized under Name Calling or Loaded Language.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces irrelevant material to distract from the central allegation. The reference by Sen. Hatch to "porn star lawyers" is a clear example, intended to distract and create a negative association by bringing up the unrelated Michael Avenatti.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified and misrepresented version of the opposition's argument. It characterizes the Democrats' position not as one of genuine concern but as a cynical plot: “What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020.” This attributes a motive to them and then attacks that motive.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text attacks the Democrats for their actions within this specific confirmation process but does not accuse them of hypocrisy by pointing to a different, past event.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It is not a neutral news report but a highly persuasive piece designed to manipulate the reader's emotions and opinions to align with a specific viewpoint. The article employs a vast array of propaganda techniques consistently and forcefully. The narrative is framed from the outset with a biased title and uses a constant stream of loaded language, name-calling, and exaggeration to portray Brett Kavanaugh as a heroic victim and his opponents as malicious, desperate villains. It systematically casts doubt on the accuser, presents a black-and-white view of the situation, and simplifies the complex controversy into a simple political plot (causal oversimplification). The heavy reliance on appeals to authority (quoting only those who support the article's thesis) and the use of red herrings further cement its function as a persuasive, one-sided argument rather than an objective account of events. The sheer density and combination of these techniques indicate a clear propagandistic intent.
