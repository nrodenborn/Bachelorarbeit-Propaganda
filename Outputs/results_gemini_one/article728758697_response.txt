1. Name calling – Yes – The headline "Dem Congressman Praises Hitler-Loving Anti-Semite" uses insulting labels to attack both the Congressman and Louis Farrakhan.
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that the media ignores racism and anti-Semitism from "the left" is stated at the beginning ("The media is very interested in racism. Except when it's coming from inside the house.") and repeated at the end ("The media is happy to talk about anti-Semitism. It just won't address left-wing anti-Semitism and racism.").
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear about a future outcome; it focuses on criticizing current and past actions.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text seeks to create doubt about the media's objectivity and integrity. Example: "The media is very interested in racism. Except when it's coming from inside the house." and "Don't count on these comments by a Congressional Black Cacus member to get reported either."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to generalize the views of a group. Example: "He was just saying what most of them think," which exaggerates by claiming to know the thoughts of most members of the Congressional Black Caucus without evidence.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the audience. Example: "Hitler-Loving Anti-Semite" and "racist hate group leader."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of Rep. Davis and, by extension, his political allies, by linking them to Louis Farrakhan, who is then directly quoted praising Hitler. Example: "Farrakhan had praised Hitler and declared that the Jews, 'can't say 'Never Again' to God, because when he puts you in the ovens, you're there forever.’ ... Hitler was a very great man."
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is good because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple reason for a complex situation. Example: "He was just saying what most of them think," which oversimplifies the potential reasons for the Caucus's silence into a single, unproven cause (that they all agree with the comments).
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and point of view.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text quotes individuals as subjects of criticism, not as authorities to support its own claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a situation as having only two options. Example: "Would a Republican get a pass on meeting with a racist hate group leader? Obviously not." This creates a false dichotomy that the media either condemns both sides equally or is completely biased, ignoring any nuances in coverage.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a phrase to dismiss dissent and discourage critical thought. Example: "Obviously not," which presents the author's conclusion as self-evident and not open to discussion.
16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on its central argument about alleged hypocrisy and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the media's position to make it easier to attack. It sets up the media as claiming to be interested in all racism ("The media is very interested in racism") and then refutes this simplified position by providing an example it claims the media is ignoring.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text's primary structure is to counter accusations of racism/anti-Semitism on one side of the political spectrum by charging the other side and the media with hypocrisy. Example: "Would a Republican get a pass on meeting with a racist hate group leader?" This deflects from a broader issue by pointing to the alleged hypocrisy of an opponent.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly propagandistic. It employs a dense concentration of propaganda techniques with the clear intent to persuade the reader towards a specific political viewpoint rather than to inform them objectively. The piece begins with inflammatory **Name calling** and uses **Loaded Language** throughout to provoke an emotional response. Its central argument is built on **Whataboutism** and a **Straw man** of the media, designed to cast doubt on its credibility. It uses **Exaggeration** and **Causal Oversimplification** to make sweeping, unsupported claims about the thoughts of an entire political caucus ("He was just saying what most of them think."). The use of **Reduction ad Hitlerum** by linking a political figure to praise for Hitler is a powerful tool of condemnation. The combination of these techniques, along with the **Black & white fallacy** and **Repetition** of its core theme, demonstrates a clear purpose to manipulate the reader's opinion against the Democratic party and the media, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
