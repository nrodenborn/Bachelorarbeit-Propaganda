### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Labels critics as "neo-Catholic commentators" and dismisses them as unserious (e.g., "neo-Catholic commentator professes he can find no source... he hasn’t bothered to do any serious investigation").  
2. **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: No single phrase or idea is repeated insistently; arguments are elaborated discursively.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable rallying phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL!") are used.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Quotes St. Francis’ prophecy to evoke dread about a papal "destroyer" causing apostasy and persecution (e.g., "persecution of faithful Catholics as ‘schismatics’").  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Questions critics’ credibility by implying they fabricate claims (e.g., "they merely assert [quotations] must be [apocryphal]... without serious investigation").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Minimizes critics’ research as lazy "Google searches" and exaggerates their dismissal of quotes as baseless (e.g., "dismiss out of hand").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to Catholic traditionalist identity by venerating saints and condemning deviations (e.g., "defending every word and deed of a given Pope... absolutely inadmissible").  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged terms like "destroyer," "apostasy," "persecution," and "schismatics" to vilify opponents.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: Does not appeal to popular opinion or trends.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: No oversimplified cause-effect claims (e.g., prophecy is discussed contextually).  
12. **Obfuscation** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses vague terms like "neo-Catholic" (undefined) and implies unclear links between St. Francis’ prophecy and Pope Francis.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Cites St. Francis, Pius XII, and St. Robert Bellarmine to legitimize arguments (e.g., "Saint Robert Bellarmine... hypothesized as possible").  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents a binary: traditionalists (virtuous) vs. neo-Catholics/modernists (deceptive), and faithful vs. "destroyer" pope.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses phrases like "That question answers itself" to shut down critical reflection on Pope Francis’ actions.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: Diverts focus by attacking Emile Poulet’s character (e.g., "Modernist apostate priest... left the priesthood and married") to discredit his critique.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: Misrepresents critics as dismissing quotes without evidence (e.g., "they merely assert... [without] serious investigation").  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: Does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy unrelated to the core argument.

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs **10 of 18 techniques** (e.g., Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language, Black & White Fallacy) to advance a specific ideological agenda: discrediting Pope Francis and "neo-Catholic" critics while promoting a traditionalist worldview. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional manipulation:** Uses apocalyptic language (e.g., "destroyer," "persecution") to instill fear.  
- **Ad hominem attacks:** Focuses on discrediting opponents (e.g., "neo-Catholics," "apostate priest") rather than engaging fairly with their arguments.  
- **Selective evidence:** Cites prophecies and authorities (e.g., St. Francis, Bellarmine) uncritically to imply Pope Francis fits a foretold crisis, while dismissing counter-evidence as malicious or lazy.  
- **False dichotomies:** Frames the debate as a battle between true traditionalists and deceitful modernists, leaving no room for nuance.  
- **Obfuscation:** Avoids direct proof of Pope Francis being the "destroyer," relying on insinuation (e.g., "what inference might one draw...?").  
The text’s goal is not balanced analysis but persuasion through demonization, appeals to tradition, and suppression of dissent, hallmarks of propaganda. The 10% uncertainty reflects the use of sourced quotations (e.g., Pius XII) and historical references, though these are weaponized selectively.
