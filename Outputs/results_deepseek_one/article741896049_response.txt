Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – No – The text uses descriptive terms like "immigration violators," "convicted criminals," and "alien" (a legal term), but these are not inherently insulting labels used purely for attack. They describe legal statuses or actions.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message about arrests and violations is stated clearly but not repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as slogans (e.g., "Build the Wall" is absent). The quoted official statement is descriptive praise, not a slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While crimes committed by some arrestees are listed (domestic violence, DUI, assault, etc.), the text reports facts without explicitly using these crimes to instill fear of immigrants or promote the operation by scaring the audience about alternatives (like not enforcing laws).
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person, group, or institution. It presents information assertively.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text reports numbers (16 arrests, 9 criminals, 2 re-entrants), charges, and convictions factually without obvious exaggeration or minimization.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – While the ICE official praises her agents ("brave men and women... keep our community safe"), this is framed as appreciation for dangerous work, not explicitly tied to patriotism, national identity, or "our way of life."
8.  **Loaded Language** – Weak/No – Terms like "violators," "brave," "harm's way," and listing crimes carry some connotation. However, the language is primarily descriptive and factual within the context of law enforcement reporting. It avoids overtly inflammatory or stereotypical emotional appeals.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis, Hitler, or universally despised groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not argue for the operation's validity based on its popularity or suggest others are adopting similar views/actions.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text does not attempt to explain complex immigration issues or the reasons for the operation with a single, simple cause. It reports the enforcement action and its results.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is specific: number arrested, nationalities, locations, specific crimes, legal consequences, custody status. It avoids unclear or confusing language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The quote from Rebecca Adducci, Field Office Director for ERO Detroit ("This operation reflects ICE’s commitment...", "I applaud the brave men and women...") uses her official position and authority to validate and lend credibility to the operation and ICE's efforts.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text does not present the immigration situation or the operation as having only two possible choices or outcomes. It reports on a specific enforcement action.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is," "America First," "common sense"). The statements are explanations or descriptions.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on reporting the details of the ICE operation: who was arrested, where, why, their status, and official statements related directly to it. No irrelevant material is introduced.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not present or refute any opposing arguments or viewpoints, weak or strong.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse critics or opponents of hypocrisy regarding immigration enforcement or related issues.

**Verdict – 10% –** The text reads primarily as a straightforward, factual press release from ICE reporting the results of a specific enforcement operation. It provides concrete details (numbers, locations, nationalities, specific crimes, legal statuses, official quotes). While it naturally presents ICE's actions in a positive light through the lens of law enforcement and uses an **Appeal to Authority** (the ICE official's quote) to validate the operation, this is standard practice for official communications. The language, while potentially carrying subtle connotations favorable to enforcement (e.g., "violators," "brave"), avoids overt emotional manipulation, fear-mongering, distortion, logical fallacies, or the other hallmarks of propaganda listed. The overwhelming focus is on reporting specific events and statements without discernible intent to deceive or manipulate the audience beyond promoting the agency's perspective on its lawful activities. The likelihood of it being deliberate propaganda is very low, hence 10%.
