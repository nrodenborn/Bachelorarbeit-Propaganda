Name calling – Yes – The poll about Jim Acosta, which is embedded in the article, contains the option, "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass," which attacks Acosta with an insulting label.

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases that function as slogans.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states, "Florida should be called and called now unless the GOP wants to Florida and Georgia stolen the way they are stealing House seats," which aims to instill fear that elections will be "stolen" if action is not taken.

Doubt – Yes – The text is structured to cast doubt on the Democratic party's actions and the integrity of election officials, for instance by mentioning "Brenda Snipes, Broward’s Elections chief, for her troubling history of election transgressions" and ending on the question of "ineptitude or deception."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline "Federal Prosecutors Called In After Florida Democrats Caught Altering Election Documents" is an exaggeration. The body of the article clarifies that prosecutors were asked to *look into* the matter, not that Democrats were definitively "caught" and proven guilty.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "stolen," "troubling history," "mishandling," and "deception" to create a negative impression.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to groups hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not claim an idea is popular to persuade the reader to agree with it.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents the complex issue of election administration and ballot curing as a simple narrative of partisan wrongdoing, culminating in the final sentence which reduces the possibilities to "Democratic ineptitude or deception."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague attribution in the line, "Some people point to Brenda Snipes," without specifying who "some people" are.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the authority of "federal prosecutors" and the "Florida Department of State" to lend weight and credibility to its narrative of wrongdoing.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The final sentence presents only two possible outcomes for the investigation: "It is yet to be determined whether the federal investigation will find Democratic ineptitude or deception in this case," ignoring any other potential explanations.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to end discussion.

Red herring – Yes – The embedded poll asking "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is entirely irrelevant to the article's topic of Florida election documents and serves to distract and engage the audience on a different, emotionally charged issue.

Straw men – No – The text makes direct accusations rather than misrepresenting and then refuting an opponent's argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect from a topic by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. While it is based on a real news event (a referral for a federal investigation), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint. This is achieved by employing a multitude of propaganda techniques.

The piece is framed with a highly exaggerated headline ("Caught Altering") and an appeal to fear ("stolen"). It uses loaded language ("mishandling," "deception") throughout to cast the subjects in a negative light and intentionally casts doubt on their motives. It oversimplifies a complex bureaucratic issue into a simple story of partisan malfeasance, presenting a false dichotomy of either "ineptitude or deception" as the only possible explanations.

Crucially, the inclusion of the entirely unrelated and repetitive poll about Jim Acosta serves as a red herring, designed to engage the publication's target audience on a separate partisan issue and collect user data. A neutral, journalistic article would have focused on the facts of the referral, sought comment from the accused party, and avoided speculative and emotionally charged framing. This text, by contrast, selectively presents information and uses persuasive techniques to construct a narrative that supports a partisan agenda, making it highly propagandistic.
