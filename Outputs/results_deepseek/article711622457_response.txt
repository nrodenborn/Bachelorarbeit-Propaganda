13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authoritative sources cited; relies on personal perspective.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Frames the issue as: focus on jihad terror (good) vs. "shoot the messenger" (bad), ignoring middle ground.

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 85% – The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements through selective framing, emotional manipulation, and multiple techniques (e.g., loaded language, whataboutism, appeal to fear). It centers on defending Trump and Spencer/Geller while attacking UK authorities as hypocritical. Though it cites factual examples (e.g., preachers’ quotes), it omits counter-evidence, uses exaggerated language ("destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism"), and distracts from the core issue (Trump’s retweets) to advance a biased narrative. The author’s permission line and self-identification as a banned "far-right" figure further signal ideological advocacy. However, the inclusion of verifiable quotes (e.g., Shaykh Sodagar’s statements) prevents a 100% rating.**  

**Breakdown:**  
- **Propaganda indicators (85%)**: Heavy use of loaded language, whataboutism, and fear appeals; clear agenda to vilify critics and glorify anti-jihad voices.  
- **Non-propaganda elements (15%)**: Specific facts (e.g., UK bans, preacher quotes) are cited accurately, but context is skewed.  
- **Overall**: The text functions as persuasive rhetoric masquerading as objective analysis, typical of advocacy journalism.
