1. Name calling – No – The text describes the actions and statements of individuals and groups but does not attack them with direct insulting labels.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text quotes Mathias von Gersdorff presenting only two possible outcomes for the German bishops: either they "forbid such blessings" in line with Church teaching, or they "essentially accept them," which ignores a wide range of other possible responses or actions.

Verdict – 85% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it reports on factual events and includes direct quotes, its primary purpose is not neutral information but persuasion. It achieves this by carefully selecting information and framing it to alarm a specific audience (traditional Catholics). The article employs numerous propaganda techniques, including loaded language ("moral turmoil") and exaggeration to create a sense of crisis (appeal to fear). It uses an appeal to authority (Mathias von Gersdorff) who then presents a black & white fallacy to heighten the stakes of the situation. Furthermore, it uses doubt and intentional vagueness ("It is not clear whether...") to undermine the legitimacy of the actions it describes. The entire narrative is a form of flag-waving, appealing to a specific Catholic identity and urging it to see these developments as a threat. The cumulative effect of these techniques moves the text from objective reporting into the realm of propaganda, designed to shape opinion and motivate its audience against the described events.
