Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "disastrous nuclear deal," "caved to Iranian pressure," "shamelessly denied."  
2. **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase is repeated verbatim throughout.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans (e.g., no equivalents to "Make America Great Again").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warns Iran could become a nuclear power like North Korea: "It bought time to turn into a full-fledged nuclear power under our noses" and references to North Korean threats.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions credibility of Kerry/Obama (e.g., "This turned out to be a lie," "another lie") and the IAEA (e.g., "IAEA relies on Iran for self-inspection").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates failures ("caved to Iranian pressure," "clean up the mess") and minimizes JCPOA compliance ("slightly exceeded... remedied").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to U.S. security/constitutionality: "Had Obama followed the Constitution," "security of the US and its allies."  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms: "reckless abandonment," "lying," "toothless," "duplicitous regime."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – Compares JCPOA to the Munich Pact with Hitler: "Appeasement through phony deals... infamous Munich Pact."  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Does not claim the anti-JCPOA stance is popular.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames Obama/Kerry alone for complex geopolitics: "Clinton started us down the primrose path... now on the verge of being able to strike the U.S. mainland."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct, not obscured.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authoritative figures cited to support claims (opponents' statements are dismissed).  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents JCPOA as all failure vs. Trump’s approach as only solution: Ignores middle-ground perspectives.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "case closed" to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – Stays focused on JCPOA flaws without major diversions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Accurately represents Kerry/Obama’s claims (e.g., quotes on inspections) before refuting.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Does not accuse critics of hypocrisy unrelated to the issue.  

---

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 9 distinct propaganda techniques (e.g., name-calling, appeal to fear, reduction ad Hitlerum) to vilify the JCPOA, Kerry, and Obama while glorifying Trump’s actions. The language is emotionally charged and one-sided, presenting complex diplomatic issues as moral failures ("lied," "caved") and ignoring counter-evidence (e.g., IAEA verification of compliance). Historical analogies (Munich Pact, North Korea) are weaponized to induce fear, and causal oversimplification assigns blame solely to political opponents. While factual elements exist (e.g., missile test details), their framing is manipulative, aiming to delegitimize opponents rather than encourage balanced discourse. The absence of neutral analysis or acknowledgment of JCPOA benefits confirms its intent to persuade through partisan rhetoric.
