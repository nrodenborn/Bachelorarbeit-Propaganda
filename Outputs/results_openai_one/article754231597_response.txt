Verdict – 10% – The text is primarily a factual report on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It provides information about the outbreak, the response by health authorities, and the history of Ebola in the country. The only potential propaganda technique present is an appeal to authority, as it references a WHO official's statements to support the response efforts. However, this is a common practice in reporting health-related news and does not significantly contribute to the text being considered propaganda. Therefore, the likelihood of this text being propaganda is very low.
