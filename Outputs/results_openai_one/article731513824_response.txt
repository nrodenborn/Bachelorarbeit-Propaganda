Verdict – 10% – The text primarily reports on events and statements related to the blessing of homosexual couples by the Diocese of Linz. It includes references to authoritative figures and documents, such as Amoris Laetitia and Pope Francis, to support the actions of the diocese, which could be seen as an appeal to authority. However, the overall tone and content of the text do not strongly indicate propaganda, as it lacks many of the typical techniques used to manipulate or persuade an audience.
