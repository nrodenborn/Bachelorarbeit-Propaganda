1. Name calling – Yes – Abid Awan's attorney is quoted calling the stepmother, Samina Gilani, a “wacko lunatic.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear by linking the subjects to a federal investigation, suggesting they made “unauthorized access” to congressmen’s data and might have been “selling [House] information,” implying a national security threat.
5. Doubt – Yes – The article is constructed to cast doubt on the Awan family's integrity, questioning their financial dealings, the timing of transactions, and Abid Awan's testimony on the witness stand where even the judge notes his difficulty answering a simple question.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The article exaggerates the significance of a family life insurance dispute by framing it as a key part of a larger national political scandal. It also minimizes a false statement on a death certificate, with the lawyer quoted as saying, “Why is that even relevant?”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the events within a context of a threat to the U.S. House of Representatives and national security, mentioning an FBI investigation into their activities involving "House computers."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language such as "Muslim Dem IT Aides," "burka-clad widow," and quotes describing the stepmother as a “wacko lunatic” and the family as being accused of "greed."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The inclusion of the poll, "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?", encourages the reader to join others in the act of condemning Democratic politicians, implying this is a popular sentiment.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The article implies a simple cause (the Awan family's greed and dishonesty) for a series of complex events, including a federal criminal investigation and their financial activities, without exploring alternative explanations or the full context of the investigation.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article uses specific names, dates, and financial figures. Its bias comes from framing and selection of facts rather than being deliberately unclear.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly cites authorities like the “FBI,” “prosecutors,” the “House Office of Inspector General,” and a “judge” to lend weight to its claims and negative narrative.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents a limited choice of "corrupt" Democrats, framing the issue as a choice between bad options rather than allowing for a more nuanced view. The narrative also paints the Awan family as wholly villainous and the stepmother as a simple victim.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases designed to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The main topic is a civil dispute over a life insurance policy, but the article repeatedly introduces the much larger, more serious, and politically charged federal investigation into the family's IT work to distract and color the reader's perception of the civil case.
17. Straw men – No – The text is presenting a one-sided narrative rather than misrepresenting and refuting an opponent's specific argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses its criticism on the Awan family and Democrats and does not attempt to deflect by accusing others of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. While it reports on a real court case and contains factual elements (names, dates, court records), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader towards a specific political viewpoint. This is achieved through the heavy use of numerous propaganda techniques.

The headline itself uses loaded language ("Muslim Dem IT Aides") and name-calling by association ("Money Laundering Cases") to immediately frame the subjects negatively. The article employs a red herring by focusing on a relatively minor family civil dispute to re-litigate a larger, politically charged scandal involving the Awan brothers' work for Democrats. It consistently uses appeals to fear and flag-waving by linking the family to potential national security threats.

The most blatant evidence of propaganda is the inclusion of a repetitive poll asking readers to identify "the most corrupt Democrat Politician." This feature serves no journalistic purpose and is purely designed to engage the reader in a political act that reinforces the article's narrative, a clear example of the bandwagon technique. The selective use of quotes, the constant appeal to authority (FBI, prosecutors) to validate the negative framing, and the black & white portrayal of the characters all contribute to a one-sided narrative designed to damage the reputation of the Awan family and, by extension, the Democratic party.
