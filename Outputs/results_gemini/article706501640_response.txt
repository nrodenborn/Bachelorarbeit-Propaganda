***

Verdict – 80% – While the article is based on a real event and contains factual information (e.g., death tolls, WHO involvement, expert quotes), its primary purpose is not to inform but to alarm. It heavily employs propaganda techniques to achieve this. The framing is built around an Appeal to Fear, using Exaggeration by focusing on a speculative worst-case scenario (mutation) and repeating it constantly. It uses Loaded Language ("Deadly Plague," "black death") to maximize the emotional impact. It then lends this sensationalized narrative a veneer of credibility by using an Appeal to Authority (quoting a professor and the WHO). A purely informational piece would have presented the facts more soberly, contextualized the risk of mutation as a general possibility for many diseases, and focused more on the current, successful containment and treatment efforts rather than future speculative horrors. The selection, framing, and repetition of information are all geared towards creating fear, which is a hallmark of propaganda.
