Verdict – 90% – The text is a news article that is overwhelmingly composed of direct quotes from political actors that employ a vast number of propaganda techniques. While presented in a journalistic format, the article's primary function is to amplify these propagandistic messages. It heavily features name-calling ("Rigged Witch Hunt"), loaded language ("dirty work," "disgrace"), appeals to fear ("stain our country"), and flag-waving ("will of We the People"). By quoting authorities like Alan Dershowitz and using bandwagon appeals ("Many Twitter users have taken his side"), the text builds a case for one side of a political argument. The article itself acts as a powerful vehicle for propaganda by curating and disseminating these emotionally charged and manipulative statements with minimal critical analysis, focusing instead on the spectacle of the political conflict.
