1. Name calling – No – The text does not use direct insulting labels against a specific person or group, but rather uses loaded language to create a negative association.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question ‘Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?’ is repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear by linking the events to a broader threat, stating that the men were “training children to carry out school shootings” and that “at least 22 verified Islamic jihadi camps have existed on American soil... within eyeshot of a nuclear power plant.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the competence of the FBI by stating the camps exist “under the watchful, or maybe not so watchful, eye of the FBI.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the scope of the threat by linking this single incident to “at least 22 verified Islamic jihadi camps” across the country, implying a widespread, coordinated conspiracy.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to national identity and patriotism by framing the issue as a threat to “Americans” on “American soil” with the line, “Well, all of this should make Americans feel just comfy, right?”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language such as “Islamic compound,” “brainwash,” and “Islamic jihadi camps” to evoke strong negative emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular or that the reader should agree because everyone else does.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple cause for the complex issue of extremism by stating the problem lies with “those who take the Quran's teachings seriously and actually are devout, not radical, followers of Muhammad,” reducing the cause to a single religion.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The claim about “at least 22 verified Islamic jihadi camps” is vague, lacking a source or specific details, which serves to create a sense of a large, undefined threat.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites official sources like the “Taos County Sheriff's Department,” “The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,” and “The Associated Press” to lend credibility to its initial claims before pivoting to opinion.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The final paragraph presents only two options: either one accepts “political correctness” or one must throw it out to deal with the supposed threat from devout Muslims, ignoring any other possible nuanced positions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “Political correctness needs to be thrown out the window” is used to dismiss nuanced discussion and discourage critical thought on the subject.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh is completely irrelevant to the story about the New Mexico compound and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that no one is making by sarcastically asking, “I mean, after all, Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah is out of office so these things aren't really going on in America, right?” This creates a false opponent that is easy to defeat.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it begins by reporting on a real news event and citing credible authorities (AP, local sheriff), it quickly pivots to a broader, fear-based narrative. The article employs a high density of propaganda techniques to achieve its goal, which is not merely to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific worldview.

It uses an Appeal to Fear by linking the isolated incident to school shootings and a nuclear plant. It employs Loaded Language (“Islamic jihadi camps”) and Causal Oversimplification to blame the events on the religion of Islam itself. It uses a Straw Man argument regarding President Obama and a Red Herring (the Kavanaugh poll) to distract and manipulate. Furthermore, it creates a Black & White Fallacy around "political correctness" and uses a Thought-terminating Cliché to shut down debate. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to shape opinion by stoking fear, distrust, and anger against a specific group, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
