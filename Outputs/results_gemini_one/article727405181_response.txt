Verdict – 15% – The text is overwhelmingly a factual news report intended to inform the audience about a scientific mission. However, it contains subtle elements of propaganda. The framing of the story, particularly in the headline ("India Joins U.S. and China") and in the body ("the agency won't beat India back to the moon"), uses the **Flag-Waving** technique by appealing to national pride and the **Bandwagon** technique by highlighting India's entry into an exclusive group of nations. This "soft nationalism" is common in reporting on international competition but still qualifies as a mild form of propaganda as it aims to shape perception through appeals to identity and popularity rather than just facts. The overall intent is informational, not deceptive, hence the very low likelihood.
