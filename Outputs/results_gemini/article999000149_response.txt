1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Ilhan Omar a "Pro-Sharia Democrat" and a "Leftist" in a pejorative context, intended to be insulting to the target audience.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not employ brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The inserted poll about the "caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border" and the option to use "military force" is designed to instill fear about immigration.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is structured to cast doubt on Ilhan Omar's character and her defense against anti-Semitism by presenting her statements and then immediately providing counter-information from sources hostile to her position.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The statement "she is a Leftist, and the Left is increasingly anti-Semitic, so she will cruise to victory" is a broad exaggeration, generalizing a large and diverse political group.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to national patriotism or identity to support its case.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "poisonous lies," "Pro-Sharia," and "evil doings" to evoke an emotional response rather than a rational one.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an idea by associating it with a group like the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text claims Omar "will cruise to victory" for the simple reason that "she is a Leftist, and the Left is increasingly anti-Semitic," reducing a complex electoral process to a single, biased cause.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not deliberately vague; its point of view and accusations are direct and clear.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the "Jewish Virtual Library," "Israel’s official New York consulate website," and the "Anti-Defamation League (ADL)" as authorities to support its argument against Omar.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents only two extreme options for dealing with the migrant caravan: "Yes, military force should be used" or "No, keep the military out of it," ignoring a wide range of other possible actions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about the migrant caravan is inserted into an article about Ilhan Omar's tweet. It is an irrelevant topic designed to distract the reader and provoke an emotional response on a separate issue.
17. Straw men – No – The text engages with arguments and statements Omar actually made (e.g., her tweet and her use of the word "apartheid") rather than inventing a false argument to attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses its criticism directly on Omar and her statements, rather than deflecting by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint of a political candidate. This is achieved through a high concentration of propaganda techniques. The article uses loaded language ("poisonous lies," "Pro-Sharia") and name-calling to frame the subject negatively from the headline. It employs causal oversimplification and exaggeration to create a biased narrative about its subject's political standing ("she is a Leftist... so she will cruise to victory"). The piece strategically uses an appeal to authority by selectively citing sources that support its viewpoint while omitting any that might offer a different perspective. Furthermore, it contains a blatant red herring—the repetitive poll about the migrant caravan—which is irrelevant to the topic at hand and serves only to distract and stoke fear. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than present a balanced account.
