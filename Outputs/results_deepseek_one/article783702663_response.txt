### Verdict – 85%  
**Explanation**:  
The text extensively employs propaganda techniques to advance a polemical narrative. It uses **loaded language** and **name-calling** ("neo-Catholics," "wolves") to vilify opponents, **exaggerates** the scale of homosexual influence, and **oversimplifies causes** by blaming Vatican II and "homosexual networks" for systemic issues. **Appeals to authority** (Viganò, supporting prelates) and **fear-mongering** (e.g., Church "strangled") bolster its credibility while **dismissing counterarguments** via **straw men** (portraying defenders of the status quo as pro-homosexuality). The **black-and-white framing** ("traditionalism vs. corruption") and **repetition** of key themes (cover-ups, resignation demands) reinforce a one-sided perspective. However, the text also cites documented events (McCarrick sanctions, grand jury reports) and direct testimony, preventing a 100% verdict. Its reliance on emotional persuasion, selective evidence, and ideological framing aligns strongly with propaganda objectives, justifying an 85% likelihood.
