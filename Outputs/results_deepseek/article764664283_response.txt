### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills" (title) and "naïve, inaccurate, misleadingly sunny view" (final paragraph). Insults Wills directly.  
2. **Repetition** – No – No significant repetition of identical phrases; arguments are varied.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – References to ISIS threats ("blow up the White House," "conquer Rome"), violence (executions, sex slaves), and weapons training to instill fear about Quranic interpretations.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Repeatedly questions Wills' credibility: "his manifest unreliability," "Wills is no more trustworthy," "ignored key passages."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes Wills' arguments as "fantasy" and "legerdemain"; exaggerates Quranic violence (e.g., framing 4:89 as a blanket command to kill apostates without context).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or group identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms like "incitement and hatred," "Islamophobes," "jihad violence," and "persecution."

10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on the popularity of the author’s view.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified cause-effect claims (e.g., acknowledges multiple interpretations but critiques Wills for ignoring them).  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Arguments are clearly stated, not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites Islamic scholar Bulandshahri to validate interpretations of Quran 2:193.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Acknowledges nuances (e.g., different Islamic interpretations exist) but critiques Wills for omitting them.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "case closed" to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – Arguments stay focused on Quranic interpretation and Wills’ reliability.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents Wills’ claim about Sharia: Wills says the Quran says "not a thing" *about Sharia law* (the term), but the author reframes it as ignoring Sharia *principles* (e.g., inheritance laws).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Does not accuse Wills of hypocrisy.

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques—including **name-calling**, **appeal to fear**, **loaded language**, **straw men**, and **doubt**—to discredit Gary Wills and advance a specific narrative about the Quran. It selectively presents evidence (e.g., highlighting violent Quranic verses Wills "ignores"), uses emotionally charged language ("terrorism," "jihad violence"), and invokes ISIS to instill fear. While it contains substantive criticism (e.g., pointing to omitted verses), its one-sided framing, derogatory tone, and reliance on emotional appeals over balanced analysis align with propagandistic intent. However, it avoids some techniques (e.g., obfuscation, thought-terminating clichés), and its citations (e.g., Bulandshahri) provide factual grounding, preventing a higher percentage.**
