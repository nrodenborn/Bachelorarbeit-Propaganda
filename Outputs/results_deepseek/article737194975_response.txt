3. **Slogans** – Yes – "Take the guns first, go through due process second" (quoted from Trump as a rallying cry).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warns of "defenseless" citizens being "robbed, assaulted, raped," and "tyrannical government" attacking liberties.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions the validity of complaints against the Seattle man: "Known for what? ... How many complaints?"  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates state actions as "Naziesque assault" and minimizes the Seattle man’s behavior ("just staring").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to patriotism: "Second Amendment liberties," "Natural right of self-defense," "constitutional rights."  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Egregious gun control machinations," "tyrannical government," "sin against God," "deliriously (and devilishly) happy."

16. **Red herring** – Yes – Focuses on Feinstein’s "delirious happiness" to distract from Trump’s role.

### Verict – 95% –   
The text is highly likely to be propaganda due to its systematic use of 17/18 identified techniques. It employs emotional manipulation (fear, religious appeals), demonization of opponents ("extremists," "Nazis"), and oversimplified causality (blaming Trump for all gun control advancements). The arguments rely heavily on loaded language, false dichotomies (surrender rights or resist as a "duty to God"), and cherry-picked examples (Seattle case) while ignoring counter-evidence. The tone is alarmist, urging outrage and vigilance, and it prioritizes persuasion over balanced analysis. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of factual elements (e.g., Trump’s quotes, state laws), but these are embedded in a framework designed to provoke ideological adherence rather than critical thought.
