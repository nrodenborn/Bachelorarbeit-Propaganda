### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic due to its heavy reliance on emotionally charged language, multiple manipulative techniques, and a clear agenda to discredit political opponents. Key indicators include:  
- **Dehumanizing language** ("Campus Commie," "loon") and **exaggeration** ("hysterical hissy fits") to vilify the subject.  
- **Fear-mongering** by linking mainstream political figures (DeSantis/Scott) to Nazism, simplifying a complex issue into a moral binary (black & white fallacy).  
- **Distraction** via irrelevant personal attacks ("where are her pants?"), undermining serious discourse.  
- **Repetition** of the "enabling Nazis" claim to reinforce the narrative without evidence.  
The text’s goal is not balanced reporting but to provoke outrage against "leftists" through selective framing, emotional manipulation, and ideological labeling. While it references a real event, the presentation is designed to inflame bias rather than inform, leaving minimal room for neutral interpretation. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the event’s existence but does not offset the pervasive propagandistic techniques.
