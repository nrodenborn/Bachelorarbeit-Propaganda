Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "lying CNN", "lying Jim Acosta", "Clown News Network", "immature children", "propaganda outlet", "rude, terrible person".
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No distinct, brief, memorable phrase is used as a slogan. "Fair and balanced" is referenced but not used as a slogan *by the author*.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text criticizes actions but doesn't instill fear about the consequences of alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "On the basis of what, Mr. Wallace?" questions the credibility/basis of Fox News' statement. "Do you see who they really are now?" questions Fox's true nature.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimization: Downplaying the legal action as "frivolous" and "grandstanding". Exaggeration: Describing CNN/Fox actions as "weaponized" (though quoting Wallace, the author uses it critically) and Fox pulling a "mask off".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – While concepts like "First Amendment" and "free press" are mentioned, they are discussed critically within the context of the specific case, not used as a broad patriotic appeal *by the author* to support their own point.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "lying CNN", "lying Jim Acosta", "neo-cons running rampant", "little Jimmy", "Clown News Network", "propaganda outlet", "immature children", "frivolous", "grandstanding", "mask off".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis or groups universally hated by the audience.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of the idea it supports; it positions itself against perceived mainstream/media actions (Fox, CNN, WHCA).
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – "Fox more than likely helped them grow a little in ratings by issuing support" simplistically attributes Fox's support solely to a ratings motive.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The author's points are generally direct and accusatory, not vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While authorities are quoted (Wallace, Sanders, Woodward), the author uses them critically or as examples of the opposition. The author doesn't cite an authority to support *their own* claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The poll presents only "Yes" or "No" as the primary options ("Maybe?" and "I'm not sure" are secondary), framing the Acosta pass issue as a binary choice. Also, framing Fox as either "controlled opposition" or truly conservative.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "If not, I can't help you" shuts down further discussion or dissent.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – "Here's the thing, if it is a right to have a press pass to the White House, where is mine? and yours? How about Infowars?" This introduces the irrelevant issue of the author's or reader's personal access (or Infowars') to distract from the specific legal/access arguments about Acosta/CNN.
17. **Straw men** – Yes – "Look how they doctored the video to not show what clearly took place and then lied about it, and I suppose Fox falls right in line with that behavior." This refutes an argument about video manipulation and lying that CNN/Fox are not explicitly making *in this text*. It misrepresents Fox's stated reason for support (free press access) as supporting doctoring videos and lying.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – While hypocrisy is implied (Fox claiming "fair and balanced" while supporting CNN), the core criticism is direct action (filing the brief), not primarily a charge of hypocrisy relative to the opponent's past actions. The text doesn't say "Fox shouldn't file the brief *because* of something specific Fox did hypocritically.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It employs numerous propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating clichés, Red Herring, Straw Men) to aggressively promote a specific, highly biased viewpoint against CNN, Jim Acosta, and especially Fox News. Its primary goal is not balanced analysis but to discredit these targets, manipulate the reader's perception of them ("Do you see who they really are now?"), and reinforce a pre-existing narrative of media bias and betrayal. The language is consistently inflammatory and dismissive ("lying", "Clown News Network", "immature children", "frivolous", "grandstanding"), designed to evoke strong negative emotions rather than encourage critical evaluation of the complex legal and journalistic issues involved. The structure, including the poll and conclusive statements, aims to solidify the reader's alignment with the author's perspective. While it references facts (the brief, statements), these are presented selectively and framed entirely through this highly manipulative and persuasive lens.
