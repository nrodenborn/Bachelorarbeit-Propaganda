Here's the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

**Propaganda Technique Analysis:**
1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "inflammatory speakers" (Vaz), "hate preachers" (Robinson), "some of the most extreme anti-Muslim activists in the world" (Collins).
2.  **Repetition** – No – No single message is repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – "Defeat Jihad" (referenced as the bloggers' poster campaign).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Statements about views that may "foster hatred" and lead to "inter-community violence" (Home Office letters), "stir up more trouble" (Collins), imply allowing entry will cause harm.
5.  **Doubt** – No – No direct questioning of credibility occurs within the presented quotes or reporting.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes (Exaggeration) – Calling the ban "a striking blow against freedom" and declaring "the nation that gave the world the Magna Carta is dead" (Bloggers) dramatically overstates the impact.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Robinson invokes "this so-called land of democracy and freedom of speech". The bloggers reference the Magna Carta. The government references "our shared values".
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Numerous examples: "anti-Muslim group", "murdered", "far-right EDL", "inflammatory speakers", "promote hate", "embarrassing", "hate preachers", "two-tier system", "anti-fascism campaigners", "delighted", "extreme anti-Muslim activists", "stir up more trouble", "foster hatred", "inter-community violence", "espouse such views".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association with Nazis or universally hated groups is made to discredit the bloggers' views.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – While support (Vaz, Collins) and opposition (Robinson) are noted, no explicit appeal to popularity ("everyone agrees/does this") is used as an argument.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The potential consequences (hatred, violence) are presented as risks based on past statements, not as simple, guaranteed outcomes.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The reporting and quotes are relatively clear. The Home Office letters cite specific reasons ("foster hatred", risk of violence) and reference examples.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The government spokesman and Home Secretary's decision are cited as justification ("A government spokesman said...", "I welcome the home secretary's ban..." - Vaz). The Home Office exclusion letters represent an official authority's judgment.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents multiple perspectives (Govt/Home Office, Vaz, Robinson, Collins/Bloggers) and nuances within the arguments, not just two absolute choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – While phrases like "shared values", "promote hate", and "foster hatred" are used, they are elaborated upon with context (e.g., linking to extremism, violence risk) rather than solely shutting down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No – The discussion remains focused on the ban, the bloggers' views, and the reasons for/against their entry. Robinson's "hate preachers" comment contrasts treatment but is directly relevant to his criticism of the ban.
17. **Straw men** – No – Arguments presented (e.g., bloggers claiming a blow to freedom, Govt. citing risk of hatred/violence, Robinson criticizing hypocrisy, Collins accusing them of stirring trouble) address the actual situation and stated positions.
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Robinson uses it: "How many hate preachers are living in this country? It just shows what sort of a two-tier system we have here." This charges the authorities with hypocrisy by pointing to others allegedly not banned.

**Verdict – 40% –** The text is primarily a factual news report presenting multiple viewpoints (government, banned individuals, supporting politician, opposing activist, critical activist group) regarding a specific administrative decision. It includes quotes containing propaganda techniques (Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear, Appeal to Authority, Whataboutism, Exaggeration, Flag-Waving, Slogans, Name Calling), primarily used *by the sources quoted* (Geller/Spencer, Robinson, Vaz, Collins, Home Office letters). However, the *structure and reporting of the text itself* maintains a relatively neutral tone, presenting these conflicting perspectives without overtly endorsing one narrative. It reports the event, the stated reasons, and reactions. While the sources use propagandistic language, the article functions more as a conduit for these views rather than deploying the techniques itself to craft a single, dominant propaganda message. The presence of strong, opposing viewpoints (Govt/Vaz/Collins vs. Bloggers/Robinson) further dilutes a singular propagandistic intent *in the reporting*. The 40% reflects the density of propagandistic language *within the quotes* contained in the report.
