### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes**

   *Explanation*: No recurring phrases or messages. The text cites multiple incidents but does not repeat a specific slogan or phrase.  

3. **Slogans** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL") are used. The text relies on descriptive language.  

4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation*: Warns that Zakkout "attempts to divide [the community] with his hatemongering," implying unchecked bigotry will fracture society.  

5. **Doubt** – **No**

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: Specific examples (e.g., direct quotes from Zakkout’s posts) are provided without clear hyperbole or understatement.  

7. **Flag-Waving** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or collective unity (e.g., "We the People").  

8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation*: Emotionally charged terms like "venomous," "grotesque," "bizarre," "toxic hate," and "facade of respectability" vilify Zakkout and his actions.

   *Explanation*: No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or Vichy collaborators.  

10. **Bandwagon** – **No**  
    *Explanation*: Does not argue that Zakkout’s views are popular or mainstream. Instead, it laments the lack of outcry.  

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No**  
    *Explanation*: No oversimplified causes (e.g., "If X, then Y"). Complexity (e.g., community inaction) is acknowledged.

14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Presents a dichotomy: Condemn Zakkout like Duke/Farrakhan, or tacitly endorse hate (e.g., "If people like David Duke... can be condemned... Zakkout can and must be as well").  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No**  
    *Explanation*: No phrases (e.g., "It is what it is") used to shut down discourse.

18. **Whataboutism** – **No**

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 25% –**  
The text documents verifiable examples of Sofian Zakkout’s bigoted statements and associations (e.g., Facebook posts praising David Duke, Holocaust denial, anti-Semitic slurs). Its primary aim is investigative exposure, not manipulation. However, it employs *some* propagandistic techniques (e.g., **loaded language**, **name-calling**, **appeal to authority**, **black & white fallacy**) to amplify outrage and urgency. These techniques serve a persuasive purpose but do not outweigh the evidentiary core. The text functions more as an exposé than pure propaganda, relying on cited sources and specific incidents to argue for accountability. Its call to action ("It is time for Zakkout to be exposed") is grounded in documented evidence, reducing its propagandistic weight.
