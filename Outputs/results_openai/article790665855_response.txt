Verdict – 80% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and red herring. These techniques are used to persuade the audience to focus on Kavanaugh's legal record rather than the sexual misconduct allegations, framing the latter as a distraction. The presence of multiple techniques suggests a high likelihood of the text being propaganda, aiming to influence public opinion against Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.
