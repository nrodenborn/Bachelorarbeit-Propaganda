Here are the propaganda techniques and whether they are used in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text labels the official explanation for JFK’s assassination as a “pat frame-up” and the term “national security” as one of the “two most important and meaningless words in the American political lexicon.”
2.  Repetition – Yes – The core message that the CIA is engaged in a “cover-up” of its role in the JFK assassination is stated repeatedly throughout the article. For example, “continue its cover-up of its assassination of the president” and “continue the JFK assassination cover-up.”
3.  Slogans – No – The text does not employ a brief, memorable phrase to promote its own message.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear of a powerful, rogue government element by repeatedly suggesting the CIA assassinated a president and is actively continuing a cover-up, implying a fundamental threat to American democracy.
5.  Doubt – Yes – The entire article is an exercise in casting doubt on the credibility of the CIA and the mainstream media. For example: “What is amazing (or not) is the extreme nonchalance of the mainstream media to the CIA’s request for continued secrecy.”
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the certainty of his predictions (“Make no mistake about it: A deal is about to be made. The CIA will cave.”) and minimizes the official “national security” argument by sarcastically questioning what old secrets could possibly matter.
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and the identity of “the American people” who are being deceived by their own government, and makes a call to civic duty: “Every American owes it to himself to read that manual.”
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as the CIA “desperately” needing secrecy, its claims being “ludicrous” and “ridiculous,” and the official story being a “pat frame-up.”
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of the CIA’s alleged strategy by comparing it to tactics taught to “Latin American military dictatorships,” a group hated or viewed negatively by the intended audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to popularity; instead, it presents its view as a contrarian one that goes against the mainstream narrative.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex reasons for classifying intelligence documents to a single, simple cause: the CIA’s desire to hide its guilt. For example: “it’s essentially an admission of guilt.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s argument, while speculative, is presented in a direct and clear manner, not with intentionally confusing language.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author uses the testimony of Lee Harvey Oswald as evidence to support the frame-up theory: “Don’t forget, after all, that that’s what Oswald said. He said he was being framed.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options for the CIA’s request for secrecy: it is either for “national security” (which the author dismisses as “ludicrous”) or it is to “continue its cover-up,” ignoring any other potential explanations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “Make no mistake about it” is used to assert a speculative conclusion as an undeniable fact, thereby discouraging critical thought or questioning of the claim.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text brings up other CIA regime-change operations in Iran, Guatemala, and Chile. These are irrelevant to the specific evidence of the JFK case but serve to distract the reader by establishing a pattern of behavior to make the central claim seem more plausible.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author presents the official story as a simplistic belief in a “lone nut former U.S. Marine communist, one who had no motive to kill the president.” This is a caricature of the official position, which is then easily refuted.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text is on the offensive, making accusations rather than deflecting criticism of its own argument by pointing out an opponent's hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. It is not a balanced news report or a neutral analysis; it is a polemic designed to persuade the reader to accept a specific, highly controversial conspiracy theory. The author systematically employs a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. The piece relies heavily on emotional manipulation (Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear), logical fallacies (Black & White Fallacy, Straw Men, Causal Oversimplification), and attacks on the credibility of official institutions (Doubt, Name Calling). It constructs a narrative that positions the CIA as a villain and the mainstream media as its complicit ally, while presenting the author's speculative theory as the only logical truth. The almost complete absence of verifiable evidence is compensated for by a dense application of rhetorical techniques aimed at bypassing critical analysis and encouraging an emotional, predetermined conclusion.
