1. Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack any person or country. It refers to them by their official titles, such as "United States government employee" or "The Cuban government."
2. Repetition – No – The text develops a story by introducing new information and does not repeat the same message or phrase over and over.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief or memorable phrases to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text builds a sense of fear and danger around the events. Examples include the headline's use of "ATTACK," the description of symptoms like "mild traumatic brain injury," "nosebleeds, nausea," and "permanent hearing or memory loss," and the State Department's warning to "move to a location where the sounds are not present."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the credibility of the Cuban government's denial. It states, "The Cuban government continues to deny they attacked U.S. diplomats," but immediately follows this with, "After months of investigations, U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device," which implicitly questions the truthfulness of the denial.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline, "Another Sound Weapon Used To ATTACK US Diplomats," exaggerates the certainty of the event. The body of the article is more cautious, stating, "It’s not known yet whether the injured government worker in China was targeted with any such device" and "It was not immediately clear if the device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text consistently frames the issue around national identity, focusing on "US Diplomats," an "American consulate," and "Americans at the embassy." This appeals to the reader's sense of patriotism and presents the events as an attack on the nation's representatives.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader. Words like "ATTACK," "weapon," "agonizing sound," "unmistakable consequences," and "strange ordeal" create a sense of menace, victimhood, and intrigue.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to groups hated by the audience, such as Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular and that the reader should adopt it for that reason.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The headline, "Another Sound Weapon Used To ATTACK US Diplomats," presents a simple and definitive cause (a deliberate attack with a sound weapon) for a complex and mysterious event that the article itself admits is not fully understood.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is reporting on a situation that is inherently vague and mysterious, but the writing itself is not deliberately unclear to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from official sources like "Jinnie Lee, U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Beijing," the "U.S. State Department," and "U.S. officials" to lend credibility and authority to its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – While it mentions two possibilities for the Cuba incident ("sonic attack" or "malfunctioning surveillance gear"), it presents them as alleged thoughts or speculation, not as the only two possible options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any clichés intended to stop critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – All the information presented, including the background on the Cuba incident, is relevant to the central topic.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that was not presented.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge an opponent with hypocrisy to deflect from the issue.

Verdict – 85% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it is structured like a news report and contains factual elements, such as quotes from official sources, its primary purpose is to frame a narrative rather than simply inform. The headline is the most significant piece of evidence, employing Exaggeration and Causal Oversimplification to declare a definitive "ATTACK" with a "Sound Weapon," a claim the article's body admits is unproven. This initial framing, combined with the heavy use of Loaded Language ("agonizing," "unmistakable consequences") and Appeal to Fear (listing severe medical symptoms), is designed to provoke an emotional response. Furthermore, the consistent use of Flag-Waving ("US Diplomats," "Americans") creates a strong "us vs. them" dynamic, casting the United States as a victim of a sinister foreign plot. The selective use of official statements to cast Doubt on Cuban denials reinforces this narrative. The combination of these techniques shows that the text is not just reporting on an event but is actively shaping the audience's perception of it as a malicious, deliberate attack on America by foreign adversaries.
