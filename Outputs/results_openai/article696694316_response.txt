Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, intentional vagueness, appeal to authority, and the black & white fallacy. These elements suggest a significant likelihood that the text is propaganda, as it seeks to influence the reader's perception of the Catholic Church and its leaders through emotional and biased language. However, it does not employ all possible propaganda techniques, which lowers the overall likelihood.
