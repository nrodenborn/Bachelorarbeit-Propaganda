1. Name calling – Yes – Explanation: "Historians will look back in amazement at how America's free trade zealots gave away the greatest manufacturing base the world had ever seen, as they quoted approvingly 18th- and 19th-century scribblers whose ideas had done so much to bring down their own country, Great Britain."
2. Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The core idea that the old Republican party is dead/gone and has been replaced by Trump's party is repeated throughout the text in various forms, such as "There is no Republican Party. There's a Trump party," "the Bush-Boehner GOP may not just be napping. It could be comatose," "Bush-Boehner Republicanism appears to be as dead today," and "If the Republican Party is "napping," let it slumber on, undisturbed, for its time has come and gone."
3. Slogans – Yes – Explanation: "After the Red Army went home, “America First” had a new appeal!"
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation: "The mass immigration of Third World peoples that began with the 1965 immigration act, and the decline in the birth rate of native-born Americans, began to swamp the Nixon-Reagan New Majority."
5. Doubt – Yes – Explanation: "How probable is it that a future GOP presidential candidate will revive the Bush-Boehner agenda the party rejected in 2016, run on it, win, and impose it on the party and nation?"
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: "Historians will look back in amazement at how America's free trade zealots gave away the greatest manufacturing base the world had ever seen..."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation: "Between 1997 and 2017, the EU ran up, at America's expense, trade surpluses in goods in excess of $2 trillion, while we also picked up the bill for Europe's defense."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: "That GOP was dedicated to free trade, open borders, amnesty and using U.S. power to punish aggressors and 'end tyranny in our world.'" (The words "open borders" and "amnesty" are used here with strong negative connotations for the target audience).
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation: The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis to discredit an idea.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – Explanation: "Yet, Donald Trump captured the Republican nomination and won the presidency—by saying goodbye to all that." (This suggests that because Trump's agenda was popular enough to win, it is the correct and inevitable path forward for the party).
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: The text presents a simple set of causes for a complex political shift: "What fractured and overwhelmed the Bush-Boehner Republican Party? First, demography... Second, the collapse of the Soviet Empire... Third, faithful to the free trade cult..."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanation: The author's points and arguments are presented directly and are not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation: "There's a Trump party," John Boehner told a Mackinac, Michigan, gathering of the GOP faithful last week." (The article opens by citing the authority of the former Speaker of the House to validate its premise).
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation: "And if Trumpism is not the future of the GOP, it is hard to see what a promising GOP agenda might look like." (This presents only two options: Trumpism or no promising future at all).
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation: "We are in a new world now." (This phrase is used to dismiss past political realities and arguments without needing to engage with their substance).
16. Red herring – No – Explanation: The text remains focused on its central argument about the transformation of the Republican party and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – Yes – Explanation: "'Trade deficits do not matter,' we hear from the economists. They might explain that to Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania." (This misrepresents the complex arguments of economists about trade deficits as a simplistic, easily dismissed statement).
18. Whataboutism – No – Explanation: The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – This text is an opinion editorial that heavily utilizes propaganda techniques to advance a specific political viewpoint. While not all editorials are propaganda, the density and variety of techniques used here push it firmly into that category. The author employs loaded language ("zealots," "scribblers," "swamp") and appeals to fear (demographic change, economic ruin) to create an emotional, rather than purely rational, response. The argument is built on a black & white fallacy, pitting the "dead" Bush-Boehner GOP against the vital and necessary "Trump party," dismissing any other possibilities. It uses causal oversimplification to explain complex political and economic shifts and a straw man argument to easily refute opposing economic views. By framing the argument with appeals to authority (Boehner) and patriotism (America First), and by declaring that Trump's victory proves the correctness of his agenda (bandwagon), the text systematically works to persuade the reader not through balanced evidence, but through a powerful and targeted combination of rhetorical manipulations characteristic of propaganda.
