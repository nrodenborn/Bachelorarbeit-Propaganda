1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses insulting labels to attack its targets, such as calling Don Lemon an "absolute hypocrite" and a "useful idiot, propagandist snowflake," and labeling CNN a "hypocritical, lying, fake news outlet."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated three times in a row to reinforce the message.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the style of a political slogan. It relies more on direct insults and accusations.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear of the migrants by describing them as "committing all sorts of crimes" and presents a poll on using "military force" to stop them, framing them as a dangerous threat.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is structured to question the credibility and integrity of Don Lemon and CNN. The line, "How can he contradict himself like that and not even bat an eyelid?" is a direct attempt to instill doubt in the audience.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates Don Lemon's position by concluding, "He just doesn't want white men here. There, I said it!", which is a significant escalation of his original statement.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue around the "US border," the enforcement of "our immigration laws," and the potential use of the "military," all of which are tied to national identity and security.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to create a negative impression, such as "utterly insane," "propagandist snowflake," and "busted through customs gates."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis to discredit its opponents.
10. Bandwagon – No – The article does not argue that its viewpoint is correct because it is popular. It presents its own arguments without referencing popular support.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces Don Lemon's complex (and controversial) statement to a simple, malicious motive: "He just doesn't want white men here."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and aggressive in its accusations. Its purpose is to attack clearly, not to confuse the audience with vague language.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The article does not cite any experts or authorities to support its claims; it relies on its own assertions.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents only two extreme options for dealing with the migrant caravan: "Yes, military force should be used" or "No, keep the military out of it," ignoring all other possible nuanced solutions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase "simply common sense" to describe its own position, which discourages further discussion by implying that any alternative view is nonsensical.
16. Red herring – Yes – While the main topic is Don Lemon's alleged hypocrisy, the text introduces the unrelated topic of "Islamic jihad" to distract and associate its opponents with another perceived threat.
17. Straw men – Yes – The article refutes an argument that was not made by claiming Lemon's statement means "He just doesn't want white men here." This creates a distorted, easier-to-attack version of his original position.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The entire premise of the article is to charge Don Lemon with hypocrisy ("How's that for hypocrisy?"), a classic whataboutism tactic used to discredit a person's argument by pointing out their own perceived faults.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader by employing a dense concentration of propaganda techniques. The article is built upon a foundation of **Name calling** ("hypocrite," "fake news") and **Loaded Language** ("utterly insane") to provoke an emotional response rather than a rational one. It systematically attacks the credibility of its targets, Don Lemon and CNN, through **Doubt**, **Whataboutism**, and by creating a **Straw man** argument ("He just doesn't want white men here") that is easier to attack than the original statement. The text uses **Appeal to fear** to characterize migrants as a criminal threat and then presents a **Black & white fallacy** in a poll to suggest a militaristic solution. The frequent use of these techniques, combined with others like **Repetition** and **Causal Oversimplification**, demonstrates a deliberate effort to manipulate the audience's perception and solidify a particular viewpoint by bypassing critical thought.
