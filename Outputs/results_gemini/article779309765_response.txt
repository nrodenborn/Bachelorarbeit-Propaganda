1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the subjects as “Islamic compound jihadis” and “extremist Muslim,” which are insulting labels used to attack them.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is repeated three times in a row. The word “Shame!” is also repeated for emphasis.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases like “Sharia trumps dead children” to encapsulate a complex argument in a simple, impactful way.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states that the children were being trained “to kill teachers, law enforcement and other institution” and that the adults were “radicalized,” instilling fear about the potential danger they pose to the public.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and competence of Judge Sarah Backus by calling her decision “stunning” and expressing hope that “no one dies because of her folly.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the hypothetical media reaction if the suspects were Christian (“there wouldn’t have been news coverage of anything else for weeks”) while minimizing the actual coverage the case received.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like “jihadis,” “extremist Muslim,” “squalor,” and “radicalized” to evoke strong negative feelings in the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest its ideas are correct because they are popular. It frames its position as being in opposition to a mainstream or “Leftist” view.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The statement “Because sharia trumps dead children” presents the judge’s complex legal decision as having a single, simple cause, ignoring the legal standards and evidence presented at a bond hearing.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text’s language is direct and inflammatory rather than intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites authorities like “Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe” and sources like “Jihad Watch” and “The Blaze” to support its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a choice between upholding justice or succumbing to “sharia.” The poll about Brett Kavanaugh also presents only two absolute options: “Yes, he will be confirmed” or “No, he will not be confirmed.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text defines “Islamophobia” as a “thought crushing device designed to silence any and critics and criticism of Islam,” a phrase that discourages any nuanced discussion of the concept.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh is completely unrelated to the New Mexico compound case and serves as a distraction. The references to “The Bundys” and “Waco” also introduce irrelevant cases to divert the reader’s attention.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an exaggerated version of the defense lawyer’s argument. The lawyer argued his clients might not be in court if they were white Christians; the text counters by creating a straw man of a massive, hypothetical media frenzy against “toxic Christianity,” which was not the lawyer's point.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects from the case at hand by bringing up other events, asking in effect, “What about the Bundys?” and “What about Waco?” to charge the justice system with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader by manipulating their emotions and shaping their perception of events. It employs an overwhelming number of propaganda techniques (16 out of the 18 listed) to achieve this goal. The piece uses emotionally loaded language and name-calling to demonize the subjects, appeals to fear to create a sense of imminent danger, and employs causal oversimplification to attribute a complex legal decision to a single, sinister motive ("sharia"). It distracts from the core issues with red herrings (the Kavanaugh poll) and whataboutism (Waco, the Bundys) while misrepresenting opposing viewpoints with straw man arguments. The entire article is constructed to provoke outrage against Muslims, the justice system, and the "Leftist" media, rather than to provide a balanced or factual account of the news event. The combination of these techniques in such high density confirms its nature as propaganda.
