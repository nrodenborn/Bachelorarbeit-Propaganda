1. Name calling – No – The text describes a practice as “dancing with corpses,” which is sensational, but it does not apply a direct insulting label to a specific person or group.
2. Repetition – Yes – The core idea that the plague is spreading due to the “dancing with corpses” ritual is stated in the headline, the first paragraph, and reinforced by the health official’s quote.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase “dancing with corpses” is used as a brief, memorable, and shocking slogan to encapsulate the story and grab the reader’s attention.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by using phrases like “The Plague Is AIRBORNE,” “killed at least 124 people,” and warning that “anyone coming close to the corpse… could themselves, catch the infection.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The text introduces doubt about the official narrative by quoting locals who claim the plague is a “government conspiracy” or that the government is “exaggerating the problem to get money.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline’s use of “Literally ‘Dancing With Corpses’” and the capitalization of “AIRBORNE” are forms of exaggeration for sensational effect. The text also reports on locals minimizing the threat by calling it “a lie.”
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text reports on locals appealing to their cultural identity and tradition (“I will always practice the turning of the bones of my ancestors”), but the article itself is not using this technique to persuade its own audience.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “plague,” “black death,” “corpse,” and the highly evocative “dancing with corpses” to create a strong emotional response.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to a widely hated entity like the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is good because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The headline and opening sentence present a single, simple cause for the outbreak: “It’s Spreading Because People Are Literally ‘Dancing With Corpses’,” simplifying a complex epidemiological event.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its message, not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from “Willy Randriamarotia, Madagascar’s health ministry chief of staff” and refers to “Health officials” to lend credibility to its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the issue as a simple conflict between two opposing views: the official scientific view that the ritual is deadly, and the local view that the plague is a lie. It presents these as the only two options, creating a false dichotomy.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – While the text quotes a local using a thought-terminating phrase (“The plague is a lie”), the article itself does not use such clichés to make its own point.
16. Red herring – No – The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main point.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not refute an argument that was not presented; it presents two conflicting viewpoints.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not use hypocrisy as a means of deflection.

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it is based on a real event and cites a real news agency (AFP), its primary goal is not to inform but to sensationalize and manipulate the reader's emotions. The headline itself is a masterclass in propaganda, employing an appeal to fear ("The Plague Is AIRBORNE"), loaded language and slogans ("Dancing With Corpses"), and causal oversimplification. The article consistently uses loaded language and frames the situation as a black & white conflict between modern health officials and superstitious locals. By selectively quoting authorities to support its main point while also including conspiratorial viewpoints, it creates a dramatic and emotionally charged narrative rather than a balanced and objective report. The heavy reliance on these techniques indicates the intent is to provoke a strong reaction of fear and shock, not to foster a nuanced understanding of a public health crisis and its cultural context.
