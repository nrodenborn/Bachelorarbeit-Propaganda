Below is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text, followed by a verdict:

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – No. No insulting labels are used against the US or its claims.  
2. **Repetition** – No. Key points (e.g., "no clues found") are stated once, not repeatedly.  
3. **Slogans** – No. No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., rallying cries).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No. No attempt to instill fear about alternatives.  
5. **Doubt** – No. The text reports China’s findings neutrally without overtly questioning US credibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes**. Minimization: China’s statement "not found any trace" downplays the severity/validity of US claims.  
7. **Flag-waving** – No. No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded language** – No. Language is neutral (e.g., "reported," "diagnosed," "investigation").  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No. No comparisons to hated groups (e.g., Nazis).  
10. **Bandwagon** – No. No appeal to popularity.  
11. **Causal oversimplification** – No. No oversimplified cause assigned (e.g., text notes cause "remains unresolved").  
12. **Obfuscation** – **Yes**. "Not found causes or clues" is intentionally vague about investigation methods/scope.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes**. Cites Vienna Conventions to legitimize China’s actions ("China has always protected safety... according to Vienna Convention").  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No. No false dichotomies presented.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No. No phrases halting critical thought (e.g., "preliminary feedback" invites ongoing inquiry).  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes**. Mentions Cuba incident (irrelevant to China’s case) to imply US unreliability: "The cause of those incidents remains unresolved."  
17. **Straw men** – No. Accurately addresses US claims without misrepresentation.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes**. Cuba reference implies US hypocrisy: "US government expelled 15 Cuban diplomats" for similar unresolved issues.

### Verdict – 30% – Explanation:  
The text exhibits **subtle propagandistic elements** (minimization, obfuscation, appeal to authority, red herring, whataboutism) primarily through framing and selective context. China’s investigation is portrayed as thorough and compliant ("always protected safety"), while US claims are minimized ("not found any trace"). The Cuba reference distracts from China’s accountability. However, the core structure remains factual and news-reporting-like, citing sources (Lu Kang, US embassy) and avoiding overt emotional manipulation. The propaganda likelihood is **moderate (30%)** as it primarily serves China’s narrative by downplaying concerns and deflecting blame, but does not heavily rely on overt techniques like fear-mongering or name-calling. The Reuters attribution adds veneer of neutrality.
