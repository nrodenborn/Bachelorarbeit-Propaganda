Verdict – 5% – The text largely reports on the developments surrounding the submission of Robert Mueller's report without employing propaganda techniques. The only potential technique identified is an appeal to authority, where Mueller's reputation is mentioned. However, this is a minor element in the overall context of the report and does not significantly contribute to the text being classified as propaganda. Therefore, the likelihood of the text being propaganda is very low.
