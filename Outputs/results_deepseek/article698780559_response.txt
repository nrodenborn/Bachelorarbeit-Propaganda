Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack a specific subject. Words like "heroic" are positive, and while authorities are implied to be deceptive, no specific insulting label is applied.
2.  **Repetition** – No – While the idea of Campos vanishing is central, the specific phrase "vanished into thin air" is used only twice. The core message isn't repeated excessively beyond the narrative flow.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used repeatedly as slogans within the text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text aims to create suspicion and distrust, but it doesn't explicitly try to instill fear *against alternatives* to support a specific idea. The fear is more general distrust of authorities.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The text systematically questions the credibility of the official narrative about Campos and the shooting. Examples: "this leads many to believe that Campos didn’t even exist," "His mere existence appears to have been fabricated," "authorities who are cramming lies down our throats," "authorities still have not released a conclusive timeline," "desperately want us to believe."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The text exaggerates the mystery and implications of Campos' disappearance and minimizes the credibility of official accounts. Example: "vanished into thin air" (exaggerating the nature of his absence), "cramming lies down our throats" (minimizing official statements as deliberate, forceful deceit).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity within the text.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and prejudicial language to evoke strong negative feelings towards authorities/the official story. Examples: "cramming lies down our throats," "fabricated," "mysteriously vanished," "desperately want us to believe."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There is no attempt to link the official narrative or Campos to a hated group like Nazis to discredit it.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text mentions "many" believe Campos didn't exist, but it doesn't primarily use the popularity of this belief as the reason to accept it.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – While implying a cover-up, the text doesn't explicitly state a single, simple cause for the complex event (the shooting or Campos' disappearance).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is actually quite direct in its accusations and implications. It doesn't use deliberately unclear language to confuse; it states its suspicions plainly.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – The text does not cite any authority figure to support its claims. It actively *discredits* authorities.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text doesn't explicitly present only two choices (e.g., "Either Campos is fake or the government is telling the truth"). It focuses on casting doubt on the official story without clearly defining the alternative.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – While phrases like "cramming lies down our throats" are loaded, they don't function specifically to *terminate* thought. They are used more as accusations to *provoke* suspicion and further questioning.
16. **Red herring** – No – The core focus on Campos' disappearance and the inconsistencies *is* the main argument casting doubt on the official narrative. It doesn't introduce irrelevant material to distract from a different point.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text doesn't misrepresent the official narrative to refute it. It points out specific inconsistencies (timelines, clinic records, license registry) and expresses distrust based on those.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge opponents (authorities/media) with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions or other issues.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits strong characteristics of propaganda. Its primary techniques are **Doubt** (systematically questioning the official story and Campos' existence), **Exaggeration/Minimization** (dramatizing the disappearance as "vanished into thin air" and minimizing official statements as deliberate lies), and **Loaded Language** (using highly charged, prejudicial terms like "cramming lies down our throats" and "fabricated"). These techniques are used consistently throughout to promote a narrative of government/media deception surrounding the Las Vegas shooting and the figure of Jesus Campos. While it presents specific claims (inconsistent timelines, missing license, failed clinic visit), the language and framing are designed not just to inform but to evoke suspicion, anger, and distrust, aligning with the purpose of propaganda to influence perception towards a specific, often conspiratorial, viewpoint. The lack of counter-perspective or evidence beyond casting doubt further supports this classification.
