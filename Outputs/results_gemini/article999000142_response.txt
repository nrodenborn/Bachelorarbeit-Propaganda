Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Hillary Clinton as “'Crooked' Hillary” and describes both her and Eric Holder as “criminals.”

Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?” is repeated three times consecutively.

Slogans – No – The text does not employ brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The poll about the “caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border” and the option to use “military force” is designed to instill fear about an external threat.

Doubt – Yes – The entire piece is designed to cast doubt on Hillary Clinton’s stated beliefs about diversity by contrasting them with her joke, as seen in the line, “Right, except she does just that and so do many in her party.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the potential reaction to a conservative making a similar comment by stating, “There would be a near lynching of them on the spot.” It also exaggerates the scope of Clinton's comment by claiming it insulted "every person with dark skin on the planet."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to national identity by presenting the “caravan of migrants” as a threat to the “U.S. border” that may require a response from the “military.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like “Disgusting,” “fawning,” “criminals,” and “racist” to provoke a strong emotional reaction from the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or person to groups like the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not claim its viewpoint is popular; rather, it frames its audience as being privy to a truth that others (like the laughing audience at the interview) are missing.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text uses a single joke from Hillary Clinton as the sole cause and definitive proof that she and her party are the “real people who engage in identity politics.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and clear in its accusations and does not use vague language to confuse the reader.

Appeal to authority – No – The text does not cite any authority figures to support its claims; it primarily attacks an authority figure.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents only two extreme options for a complex issue: “Yes, military force should be used” or “No, keep the military out of it,” ignoring all other possibilities.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common, cliché phrases to end discussion.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll about a migrant caravan and the use of military force, which is completely irrelevant to the story about Hillary Clinton’s joke, serving to distract and push a separate agenda.

Straw men – Yes – The text sets up Clinton's stated ideals about politeness and diversity as an argument and then uses her single joke to "refute" this entire position, as if the joke is the totality of her beliefs.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text immediately deflects from the subject by saying, “Well, this didn't come from President Donald Trump,” and later asks, “Can you imagine if a conservative person uttered those comments?” This shifts the focus to the perceived hypocrisy of others.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and overt piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader by manipulating their emotions and opinions. This is achieved through the heavy use of numerous propaganda techniques. The article employs name-calling (“Crooked Hillary”), loaded language (“Disgusting,” “criminals”), and exaggeration (“near lynching”) to create a strong negative emotional response towards Hillary Clinton. It uses whataboutism and doubt to undermine her credibility while deflecting criticism from its own political side. Furthermore, it inserts a completely unrelated red herring—the fear-inducing poll about the migrant caravan—to push a separate political narrative and collect user data. The combination of these techniques, all aimed at shaping perception rather than presenting facts objectively, confirms its status as propaganda.
