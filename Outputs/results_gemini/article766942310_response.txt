1. Name calling – Yes – The author labels the subjects with insulting terms such as ‘Great White Father Trump’, ‘delinquent Kim Jong-un’, ‘schoolyard bullies’, ‘publicity seekers’, ‘chunky leaders’, and calls John Bolton a ‘fanatic’s fanatic’.

2. Repetition – No – While the central theme that the summit was a failure for the US is consistent, the text does not repeat the same specific message or phrase over and over.

3. Slogans – Yes – The author uses the headline from The Economist, ‘Kim Jong Won!’, as a brief and memorable phrase to encapsulate his entire argument, stating “That said it all.”

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The author highlights the continued threat from North Korea to instill fear and argue that the summit was a failure, stating, “They threaten almost all of South Korea’s capital Seoul... This is a very real threat” and noting that this was not addressed.

5. Doubt – Yes – The author questions the credibility and substance of the summit, describing it as a “very expensive photo op for both publicity seekers that made much noise but produced very little” and casting doubt on the narrative sold to the “seriously credulous” American public.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates by calling the summit a “love-fest” and a “second-coming extravaganza.” He minimizes its achievements by calling them “very little” and mere “gestures.”

7. Flag-Waving – No – The text critiques US national policy and its leader rather than appealing to patriotism to persuade the audience.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The author uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language like ‘delinquent’, ‘bullies’, ‘huffing and puffing’, ‘fanatic’s fanatic’, and ‘stooges’ to influence the audience's perception.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other groups widely hated by the audience to discredit an idea.

10. Bandwagon – No – The author argues against the perceived popular narrative that the summit was a success, rather than suggesting the reader should agree with him because everyone else does.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author simplifies the complex motivations for the summit by attributing it primarily to Trump’s desire for “show-biz” and to be a “publicity seeker,” ignoring other complex geopolitical factors.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s language is direct and his points are specific and clearly stated; he is not trying to be intentionally vague or confusing.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text opens by citing and agreeing with “the great Economist” magazine to lend credibility to its argument. The author also subtly presents himself as an authority by saying, “I have seen these emplacements from the northern edge of the DMZ.”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the summit in binary terms as a clear win for Kim and a loss/humiliation for the US (“Kim Jong Won!”), ignoring any nuanced or mutually beneficial outcomes.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author uses the phrase “That said it all” after quoting The Economist’s headline, a cliché used to assert a conclusion is obvious and to discourage further discussion.

16. Red herring – No – The author does not introduce significant irrelevant material to distract from the main argument. The text remains focused on the summit and its consequences.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an exaggerated version of the opposing argument by claiming Trump’s supporters believe Americans “no longer have to fear North Korea and can sleep peacefully at night!” This oversimplifies and misrepresents the position of those who saw the summit as a positive step, making it easier to attack.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text is a direct critique and does not attempt to deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly propagandistic. It employs a significant majority (11 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques to advocate for a specific, one-sided viewpoint. The author’s primary goal is not to provide a balanced analysis of the summit but to persuade the reader that it was an unmitigated failure for the United States and a triumph for North Korea.

This is achieved by framing the entire piece with an appeal to authority (The Economist) and a slogan (‘Kim Jong Won!’). The author uses emotionally loaded language, name-calling (‘delinquent Kim’, ‘chunky leaders’), and exaggeration to paint the participants and the event in a negative light. Logical fallacies are prevalent, including a black & white fallacy that presents the outcome as a simple win/loss, a straw man argument that misrepresents the opposing view as naive, and causal oversimplification that reduces Trump’s motives to mere “show-biz.” By consistently using these techniques, the text moves beyond opinion or commentary into the realm of propaganda, as it systematically manipulates information and emotion to push a specific agenda rather than encouraging critical thought.
