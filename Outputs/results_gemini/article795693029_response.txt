***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a news article that heavily reports on statements made by a political figure. While the article itself includes factual reporting from sources like NBC News and The Washington Post (e.g., caravan size, border apprehension statistics), the overwhelming majority of the text consists of direct quotes from Donald Trump that are laden with propaganda techniques. The article acts as a vehicle for this propaganda. The quoted statements employ a vast array of techniques, including appeal to fear, loaded language ("onslaught," "assault"), name-calling ("CRIMINALS"), causal oversimplification ("All Democrats fault"), and the straw man fallacy ("they want Open Borders"). These techniques are not used to inform but to persuade an audience by creating an emotional response of fear and anger, simplifying a complex issue, and polarizing the public. The article presents these propagandistic statements with little to no critical analysis or counter-framing, therefore functioning primarily as a platform for the propaganda it contains.
