Name calling – Yes – The author calls the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, “dim-witted” and a “neocon poster-girl”.

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the catastrophic consequences of a potential war, mentioning high casualties (“250,000 US casualties”), the destruction of cities (“shatter Japan,” “cripple South Korea”), and the immense human cost (“tens of millions of South Korean and Japanese civilians who are at risk”).

Slogans – Yes – The title of the piece, “End The Korean War!”, functions as a brief, memorable slogan summarizing the author’s main point.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text details the horrific consequences of a potential war, such as “250,000 US casualties,” the potential for nuclear weapons to “shatter Japan” and “cripple South Korea,” and the global spread of “radioactive dust.”

Doubt – Yes – The author questions the credibility and competence of the US administration by calling them “amateur foreign policymakers” and stating that President Trump “really does not know what to do next.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates for rhetorical effect when describing Nikki Haley’s foreign policy experience as having been “limited to the International House of Pancakes in her native South Carolina.”

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to American patriotism; in fact, it is highly critical of US foreign policy and military actions.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “dim-witted,” “bloody slog,” “growing US hysteria,” and “bombast” to evoke negative feelings towards US policymakers and the prospect of war.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not associate any idea or person with Hitler or the Nazis to discredit them.

Bandwagon – Yes – The author states that “Most South Koreans shrug off the North’s threats and seek to avoid war at all costs,” using the popularity of this sentiment among the most affected group to support his argument against war.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author claims North Korea developed nuclear weapons for “the sole reason of deterring a major US attack,” which simplifies a complex issue by ignoring other potential factors like internal regime propaganda, regional power dynamics, or leadership consolidation.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s language is direct and his arguments are clearly stated, not vague or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites “US experts” to validate claims about North Korea’s missile capabilities and also establishes his own authority by stating, “I’ve been in the deep North Korean-dug tunnels under the Demilitarized Zone.”

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a choice between a catastrophic military conflict and the author’s proposed diplomatic solution (“recognize North Korea, set up diplomatic relations…”), ignoring a spectrum of other possibilities like continued sanctions, different diplomatic strategies, or multilateral negotiations.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; it presents a detailed, albeit one-sided, argument.

Red herring – No – The points raised, while often inflammatory, are used to support the central argument about the dangers of war with North Korea and are not used to distract from the main issue.

Straw men – Yes – The author portrays the US administration’s position as simply being “heedless of these hard facts” and beating “the war drums,” refuting a simplified, belligerent caricature rather than engaging with potentially more complex arguments for intervention, such as non-proliferation or alliance protection.

Whataboutism – Yes – When discussing North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, the author deflects by pointing to other nations, stating, “Pakistan ‘ate grass’ for decades to afford nuclear weapons... Israel uses the same argument to justify its large nuclear arsenal.”

***

Verdict – 90% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While presented as a political commentary, it employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to advocate for a specific viewpoint (ending the conflict with North Korea through diplomacy) while vehemently attacking the alternative. The author's goal is not to present a balanced analysis but to persuade the reader by manipulating emotions and employing logical fallacies.

The core of the argument is built on a powerful appeal to fear, graphically detailing the potential for nuclear war, mass casualties, and environmental disaster. This is reinforced by the heavy use of loaded language (“dim-witted,” “bloody slog,” “hysteria”) and direct name-calling to discredit opposing figures and policies.

The author structures the argument using logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy (presenting the only options as catastrophic war or his specific diplomatic solution), causal oversimplification (claiming North Korea’s *sole* motive is deterrence), and straw men (portraying the US administration as simply ignorant warmongers). Furthermore, the use of whataboutism (citing Pakistan and Israel) serves to excuse or contextualize North Korea's actions and deflect criticism.

Although the text contains factual data (e.g., troop numbers, missile names), this information is carefully selected and framed to support the author's predetermined conclusion. The combination of emotional manipulation, personal attacks, and logical fallacies to promote a specific agenda makes this a clear example of propaganda.
