Verdict – 20% – The text contains some elements that could be considered propaganda, such as repetition, doubt, loaded language, and appeal to authority. However, these elements are used in a journalistic context to report on the issue of child abuse within the Catholic Church rather than to manipulate or persuade the audience in a propagandistic manner. The text primarily aims to inform and present various perspectives on the issue, which reduces the likelihood of it being considered propaganda.
