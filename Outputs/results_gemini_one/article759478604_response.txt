1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to those implementing the new rules as “the despots of the New Paradigm” and “anti-Catholic revolutionaries.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The central idea that the new document is destructive is repeated throughout the text using phrases like “‘Cor Orans is the Death-Knell of Carmel’,” “It signals the end of the contemplative monastic life,” and “This is a disaster.”
3. Slogans – Yes – The title of the article itself serves as a slogan: “‘Cor Orans is the Death-Knell of Carmel’”.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses frightening language to describe the consequences of the document, such as, “This is a disaster,” and “The little green shoots of hope that the faithful Catholic world so rejoiced to see are to be stamped back into the frost of Vatican II’s perpetual winter.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and understanding of a Vatican official: “It is to wonder what this man [Archbishop Carballo] would make of a comment by the great Dom Paul Delatte.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggerated language to describe its opponents' motives and actions: “to fulfill the totalitarian fantasies of the anti-Catholic revolutionaries” and “his vicious persecution of the Franciscans of the Immaculate.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the specific religious identity of the Carmelite order: “Authentic autonomy, independence of formation and finances, ‘are essential points of our charism that Our Holy Mother established and to do away with them is to do away with the charism.’”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words intended to provoke a reaction, such as “death-knell,” “disaster,” “frightening,” “despots,” and “vicious persecution.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of an idea by associating it with a group hated by the audience (Marxists): “Given the Marxist leanings of the recent crop of Fathers General, it seems clear that what can be expected by ‘ongoing formation’ is, in essence, some form of political indoctrination.”
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to popularity. In fact, it does the opposite, arguing that the few "holdouts" who resist the popular trend are the ones who are correct.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex issue of declining vocations and struggling monasteries to a single cause: the reforms following the Second Vatican Council. “The whole world has seen what happens to religious life that takes on the VaticanTwoist New Paradigm.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s argument and accusations are direct and clearly stated, not vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The argument relies heavily on the testimony of “Sister T, fully professed and a senior member of the monastery’s council,” and quotes other authorities like “Dom Paul Delatte, OSB, Abbot of Solesmes.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between only two options: “The Vatican presents a choice: the world, or Christ.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to end discussion; rather, it presents a detailed (though one-sided) argument to persuade the reader.
16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on its central topic: the perceived negative effects of the document “Cor orans” on contemplative monasteries.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified and uncharitable version of the opponent's argument: “Not the charism of the order, nor the rule, nor the Patristic tradition... just Vatican II.” This portrays the Vatican's position as a total rejection of tradition, which is a caricature.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges Pope Francis with hypocrisy: “In this day and age, when Pope Francis is proclaiming... the ‘rights’ of women, here our rights are completely taken away.”

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to persuade the reader, rather than presenting a balanced or objective analysis. The author uses highly emotional and loaded language (death-knell, disaster, despots), appeals to fear about the future of monasticism, and relies on name-calling (“anti-Catholic revolutionaries”) and reduction ad Hitlerum (invoking Marxism) to demonize the opposition. The argument is built on logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy (“the world, or Christ”), causal oversimplification (blaming Vatican II for all problems), and straw men (misrepresenting the Vatican’s position). It consistently appeals to the authority of like-minded figures and to the specific identity of traditional Catholics to create an in-group vs. out-group dynamic. The entire piece is structured not to inform, but to alarm and rally the reader to a specific, highly critical viewpoint.
