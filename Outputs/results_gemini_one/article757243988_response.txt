Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The headline frames the academic exercise as "Submission To Allah." While "Islam" translates to "submission to God," using this specific phrasing in the headline is a form of name-calling, intended to sound sinister and imply forced conversion rather than education.

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times in a row. The core message that Islam is receiving special, preferential treatment over Christianity is also repeated throughout the text in different ways.

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates a sense of a widespread and insidious threat with the opening line, "We see this again and again: schoolchildren have to make the Islamic profession of faith or affirm Islam as fact, in public schools." This is designed to instill fear in parents about the indoctrination of their children.

Doubt – Yes – The article systematically casts doubt on the credibility of the school officials. After quoting Principal Branch's explanation, it immediately counters with, "Penkoski and his daughter, Brielle, contested Branch’s claims," directly questioning his version of events.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of a calligraphy assignment, framing it as a forced religious profession ("Write Out Their Submission To Allah"). Conversely, it minimizes the stated educational context of a world religions unit.

Flag-Waving – No – The appeal in the text is to a religious identity (Christianity) rather than a national or patriotic one.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "Christian Parent Furious," "forced to make professions of faith," and "Submission To Allah" to evoke an emotional response of outrage and alarm from the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea; rather, it presents a parent as standing against a perceived trend.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The article implies a simple and malicious cause—a deliberate pro-Islam agenda in public schools—for what is a complex situation involving a teacher's specific curriculum choices for a world religions class. It posits, "For some reason, this form of educational exercise is only ever used regarding Islam. Now, why is that?" suggesting a single, sinister reason.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article is direct in its accusations and point of view, not intentionally vague.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The article presents Rich Penkoski not just as a parent, but as the "founder of online ministry Warriors for Christ," lending him authority for the target audience. The article is also posted "with permission from Robert Spencer," who is an authority figure within anti-Islam circles.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice: either the school is actively promoting Islam, or it is treating all religions, especially Christianity, equitably. By claiming Christianity was not treated the same ("Notice no Bible verses..."), it concludes the only other possibility must be true.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; it actively seeks to provoke a specific line of thinking.

Red herring – Yes – The poll asking "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is a classic red herring. It is completely irrelevant to the story about the school assignment and serves to distract and associate the issue with a separate political grievance.

Straw men – Yes – The parent refutes the school's explanation that the assignment was for calligraphy practice by arguing, "calligraphy was invented in China 3,000 years prior to Muhammad." This is a straw man because the school was not claiming Islam invented calligraphy, only that this was an exercise *in* calligraphy. He attacks an argument that was never made.

Whataboutism – Yes – The article’s central argument is a form of whataboutism. It constantly deflects from the context of the Islam lesson by asking what about Christianity: "But we never, ever see Judaism or Christianity or Hinduism or Buddhism taught as fact in public schools..." This is used to allege hypocrisy and unfair treatment.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. It is not a neutral piece of journalism but a persuasive article constructed to promote a specific ideological viewpoint. The evidence for this is the sheer number and variety of propaganda techniques employed. The article begins with a fear-appealing and emotionally loaded headline, frames the entire issue as a conflict between a "Furious" Christian parent and a school promoting Islam, and systematically works to discredit the school's account using doubt and straw man arguments. The core of its argument rests on whataboutism (comparing the treatment of Islam to Christianity) and a black-and-white fallacy. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant political poll (a red herring) further reveals its intent to conflate issues and rally its target audience along partisan lines. Rather than reporting on an event, the text selectively presents and frames information to provoke outrage and confirm a pre-existing narrative of Christian persecution and Islamic encroachment in American public life.
