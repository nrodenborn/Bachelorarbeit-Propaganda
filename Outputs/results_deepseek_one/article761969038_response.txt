Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Main Stream Media" (used with implied negative connotations as gatekeepers suppressing the "immigration moratorium solution").
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – "ADVANTAGE NATIVE-BORN" is repeated three times to emphasize a perceived superiority.
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "The New VDAWDI" is introduced as a branded, memorable term for their displacement index.
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "Time is running out for native-born workers—a.k.a. Americans" instills fear about the future of native-born workers.
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Can the same be said for the Obama Administration?" questions the administration's legitimacy/sustainability.
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "a whopping 24.2%" (exaggerates Hispanic job growth) and "Time is running out" (exaggerates urgency). Minimizes context behind statistics.
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Equates "native-born workers" with "Americans," framing the issue as patriotic/national identity.
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "displacing," "bleaker," "panic," "befuddled," "convenient proxy," and "practical effect" carry negative/emotional weight.
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or vilified groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to popularity or trends.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes native-born job losses primarily to immigration ("displacing"), ignoring other economic factors (automation, policy, education, etc.).
12. **Obfuscation** – **No** – Data is presented clearly (though selectively); no deliberate vagueness.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Repeatedly cites BLS data to validate claims (e.g., "Source: BLS").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Frames job market as a zero-sum competition: immigrants vs. native-born (e.g., "ADVANTAGE NATIVE-BORN" tables).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" used to halt discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Mentions Obama’s inauguration timing ("amazing coincidence") to imply blame, distracting from economic analysis.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting opponents.

**Verdict – 80% –**  
The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs multiple propaganda techniques: **Name-calling** ("Main Stream Media"), **Repetition** ("ADVANTAGE NATIVE-BORN"), **Appeal to fear** ("Time is running out"), **Loaded Language** ("displacing," "bleaker"), **Black & white fallacy** (immigrants vs. natives), and **Causal Oversimplification** (blaming immigration for job losses). It selectively presents data from authoritative sources (BLS) to lend credibility but frames it through a nativist lens, using emotionally charged terms to portray immigrants as a threat to native-born workers. The red herring about Obama’s inauguration and the slogan "The New VDAWDI" further signal an agenda to promote a specific ideological narrative about demographic displacement. While it includes factual data, its presentation, omissions of broader economic context, and persistent us-vs-them framing align with propagandistic objectives. The absence of certain techniques (e.g., Reduction ad Hitlerum) prevents a 100% rating, but the cumulative effect strongly indicates propaganda.
