1. Name calling – No – The text reports that an organizer called Nimesh Patel "disrespectful," but the article itself does not use any insulting labels to attack a subject.
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat any message; it presents a chronological account of an event.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief or memorable phrases to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear in the reader.
5. Doubt – No – The text reports on the conflicting accounts between Patel and the organizers but does not itself cast doubt on the credibility of either party. It presents the information factually.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text reports on the events without any apparent exaggeration or minimization. It describes the tension and the actions taken in a neutral tone.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions the "Asian American Alliance" as the host of the event, which is a factual detail, but it does not use this to appeal to the reader's sense of patriotism or identity.
8. Loaded Language – No – The text uses neutral and descriptive language. Phrases like "uncomfortable territory" are used to describe the content of the jokes and the reason for the reaction, not to emotionally manipulate the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or person to a group hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text avoids oversimplification by presenting multiple potential causes for the set being cut short: the organizers' stated reason (tech issue) and Patel's belief (audience didn't like his jokes).
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is clear and direct. It even highlights its own lack of information by stating it is waiting for a statement from the Asian American Alliance, which is an act of transparency.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text itself does not use an authority's support as evidence. It does, however, report that Nimesh Patel used this technique in his own defense with the quote: “I’m a generation older than all of you I know comedy.”
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text presents multiple perspectives (Patel's, the organizers') rather than reducing the situation to only two options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any clichés to discourage critical thought. It reports that Nimesh Patel used one ("I know comedy"), but the article itself does not.
16. Red herring – No – The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the reader from the main point.
17. Straw men – No – The text is a report, not an argument, and does not refute any unstated positions.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge anyone with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 5% – The text is a news report, not a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about an event that occurred, not to persuade them to adopt a particular viewpoint. It maintains a neutral tone, presents multiple perspectives from the parties involved (Nimesh Patel and the event organizers), and uses factual, descriptive language. The text reports on individuals who may have used rhetorical or persuasive techniques (such as Patel's appeal to authority), but the article itself does not employ these techniques. It adheres to journalistic standards by quoting sources directly and noting that it has reached out for comment. The very low percentage accounts for the inherent, unavoidable bias in selecting which facts to present, but the text shows a clear intent to report objectively rather than to propagandize.
