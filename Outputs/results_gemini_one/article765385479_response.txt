Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text labels journalists critical of Assange as “Vichy journalists” and quotes a tweet calling Assange “Putin’s bitch.” It also quotes a book that called Assange a “damaged personality” and “callous.”

Repetition – Yes – The core message that Julian Assange is being persecuted and that the Australian government must act to “bring him home” is repeated throughout the text, appearing near the beginning and as the concluding call to action.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases that act as slogans, such as the opening line: “The persecution of Julian Assange must end.”

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns of dire consequences if action is not taken, stating, “The persecution of Julian Assange must end. Or it will end in tragedy,” and later, “That is why Assange is in mortal danger.”

Doubt – Yes – The text systematically questions the credibility of Assange’s opponents, for example, by pointing out that Hillary Clinton “offered no evidence — nor was asked for any — to back her grave allegations” against Assange.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the attacks on Assange, calling them a “tsunami of lies and smear,” while minimizing the allegations against him, stating, “The Swedish episode was bogus and farcical and he has been vindicated.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text repeatedly appeals to Australian national identity and duty, referring to Assange as a “remarkable Australian citizen” and calling on the Prime Minister to “bring his son home.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as “persecution,” “tragedy,” “tsunami of lies and smear,” “vindictively,” “perfidiously,” and “media witch-hunt.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text explicitly compares journalists critical of Assange to the Nazi-collaborating Vichy government in France: “I call them Vichy journalists — after the Vichy government that served and enabled the German occupation of wartime France.”

Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that support for Assange is widespread, stating his “courageous public service is recognised by countless people across the world.”

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes complex geopolitical events to a single cause, for example: “Thanks largely to her [Hillary Clinton], Libya became a breeding ground for ISIS and other jihadists.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and accusatory rather than vague. It makes clear claims and names specific individuals and organizations as responsible parties.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites authorities to support its claims, such as when it mentions that a “United Nations Special Rapporteur called it torture” in reference to Chelsea Manning’s treatment, and quotes Harold Pinter.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a situation with only two possible outcomes for the Australian government: “They can remain silent, for which history will be unforgiving. Or they can act in the interests of justice and humanity and bring this remarkable Australian citizen home.”

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases to shut down discussion. Instead, it actively makes a detailed, albeit one-sided, argument to persuade the reader.

Red herring – Yes – While discussing an interview with Hillary Clinton about Assange, the text goes into a long, detailed tangent about her role in the destruction of Libya and arms sales to Saudi Arabia. This serves to demonize Clinton rather than directly address the points of the interview concerning Assange.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified version of its opponents’ arguments. For example, it characterizes The Guardian’s critical stance as a petty, personal “vendetta” and the actions of a “spurned lover,” ignoring any potentially complex journalistic or ethical reasons for their reporting.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text accuses opponents of hypocrisy. For instance, it points out that Malcolm Turnbull, who is now silent on Assange, once “fought the British Government’s attempts to suppress free speech” when he defended the publication of the book Spycatcher.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and powerful example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform in a balanced way, but to persuade the reader to adopt a very specific viewpoint and support a specific course of action. It achieves this by employing a vast majority (16 out of 18) of the propaganda techniques listed.

The piece systematically builds a narrative of a heroic victim (Assange) being unjustly persecuted by a cabal of powerful and corrupt enemies (the US government, specific politicians like Hillary Clinton, and the "Vichy media"). It relies heavily on emotional manipulation through Loaded Language ("persecution," "tragedy," "vendetta") and Appeals to Fear ("mortal danger"). It demonizes opponents using Name Calling ("Vichy journalists"), Reduction ad Hitlerum (the Nazi-collaboration comparison), and by portraying them as hypocrites (Whataboutism).

The argument is framed using a Black & White Fallacy, presenting the Australian government with only two stark choices. It simplifies complex issues (Causal Oversimplification) and attacks weakened versions of its opponents' positions (Straw Men). The author's viewpoint is bolstered by appealing to patriotism (Flag-Waving), popular opinion (Bandwagon), and experts (Appeal to Authority). The sheer density and combination of these techniques create a highly persuasive but extremely one-sided account, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
