1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels for groups, such as "Muslim settlers" to describe Muslims living in France, and implies European authorities are "insane."

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly presents a pattern: a Muslim commits a violent act while shouting "Allahu Akbar," and the European authorities subsequently blame "mental illness." This pattern is repeated with examples from France, Germany, Russia, and the Netherlands to reinforce the central message.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases designed to be easily repeated as standalone slogans.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text lists a series of violent, graphic attacks (beheading, stabbing, beating to death) to instill fear in the reader. It suggests that the authorities' response is inadequate, implying that the reader and their society are in ongoing danger from this threat.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire text is structured to cast doubt on the credibility, competence, and motives of European authorities, police, and psychiatric professionals. The final line, "Maybe it's the authorities who are insane," is a direct questioning of their credibility.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the uniformity of the official response across all of Europe, presenting it as a monolithic "standard excuse." It also uses the sweeping exaggeration, "They're all crazy in Europe."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to identity by specifically mentioning the victim was a "Jewish man (wearing a kippah on his head)" and another target was a "Jewish restaurant," creating a sense of an "us vs. them" conflict based on religious identity and solidarity against anti-Semitism.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language. The term "Muslim settlers" is a loaded phrase, and the descriptions of the violence are graphic to provoke an emotional response.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – While the text quotes an attacker shouting "Long live Hitler," the author is not using this technique. The author is reporting the attacker's words as evidence of motive, not discrediting an opponent's idea by associating it with Hitler.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text argues against the perceived mainstream or official consensus, positioning itself as a contrarian voice rather than appealing to the popularity of an idea.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a single, simple reason for the authorities' actions in multiple complex cases across different countries: a deliberate effort to cover up Islamic extremism by blaming mental illness. This ignores the unique legal, political, and psychiatric details of each individual case.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's message is direct, clear, and unambiguous. The text accuses the authorities of obfuscation but does not use the technique itself.

13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does the opposite; it systematically attacks and undermines the credibility of authorities like the police, doctors, and the judicial system.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two explanations for the attackers' motives: they are either driven by radical Islam (the author's position) or they are simply "mentally ill" (the "insane" authorities' position). It dismisses any nuance or the possibility that both could be factors, forcing a choice between two extremes.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text uses sarcasm and rhetorical questions to make its point, but it does not rely on stock phrases or clichés meant to shut down critical thought.

16. Red herring – No – All the examples and information presented, however biased, are directly relevant to the author's central argument and are not used to distract the reader.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text creates a simplified and easily refutable version of the authorities' position. For instance, it claims the "German authorities came to the inescapable conclusion that the attack had nothing to do with Islam," which is likely a caricature of a more nuanced official statement, making the official position seem absurd and easy to attack.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses on accusing authorities of a specific failure and does not deflect criticism by charging them with hypocrisy on an unrelated matter.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly a piece of propaganda. It does not aim to inform in a balanced way but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly emotional, and cynical viewpoint. It achieves this by selectively presenting factual events (the attacks) while stripping them of individual context and nuance. The author then weaves these events into a single, overarching narrative using a high density of propaganda techniques. The piece relies heavily on loaded language ("Muslim settlers"), appeal to fear (graphic descriptions of violence), causal oversimplification (blaming all official responses on a single conspiracy of political correctness), and casting doubt on all official institutions. By creating a straw man of the "official explanation" and presenting the issue as a black & white fallacy, the text funnels the reader towards a predetermined conclusion: that European authorities are deliberately and insanely ignoring a clear and present danger of Islamic extremism. The goal is not to analyze a complex social issue but to generate anger, fear, and distrust.
