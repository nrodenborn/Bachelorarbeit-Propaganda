1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels such as describing Mike Pompeo’s comments as “un-American,” referring to the government as the “Deep State” engaged in “criminal activity,” and quoting Glenn Greenwald who calls Gina Haspel an “actual torturer.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats Donald Trump's tweet announcing the changes, both in text form and as an embedded image. The accusation that Gina Haspel was involved in torture is also repeated through quotes from Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald.
3. Slogans – Yes – The title of the article, “From Bad To Worse?”, acts as a memorable phrase that frames the entire piece with a negative outlook.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear and concern about the new appointments by stating, “it looks like it’s about to get a lot worse.” It highlights Pompeo’s stance against whistleblowers and Haspel’s alleged involvement in torture to instill fear about the future of the State Department and CIA.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the White House's narrative by highlighting the firing of spokesman Steve Goldstein, who “contradicted the administration’s account of Tillerson’s ouster.” This questions the credibility and transparency of the administration's actions.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text includes a quote from Edward Snowden that uses exaggeration: “The CIA might as well start issuing uniforms decorated with skulls and lightning bolts.” This exaggerates the character of the CIA to create a strong negative image.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific interpretation of American values by labeling Pompeo’s comments as “un-American” and quoting Snowden asking, “Are these really the values the US should be promoting?” This frames the appointments as being against true patriotism.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “crimes of our government,” “fraught relationship,” “horrific torture,” and “gruesome torture” to evoke a strong emotional response from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text quotes Edward Snowden’s tweet, “The CIA might as well start issuing uniforms decorated with skulls and lightning bolts,” which is a clear allusion to the insignia of the Nazi SS, thereby associating the CIA with a hated group.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text uses phrases like “a lot of us can just shout out” and “many of us are concerned” to suggest that the viewpoint presented is already held by a large group, encouraging the reader to join in.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not assume a single simple cause for a complex event. It mentions several reasons for Tillerson's firing, such as disagreements over the Iran deal and North Korea.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its criticism and uses specific quotes and examples to make its point. It is not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on the authority of figures like Edward Snowden and journalist Glenn Greenwald. Their tweets and articles are used as the main evidence to support the article’s critical stance on the appointments.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The title “From Bad To Worse?” presents a false dilemma, suggesting the only two possibilities are a bad situation (with Tillerson) or a worse one (with Pompeo/Haspel), ignoring other potential interpretations or outcomes.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase “This is more of the same old, same old going on” to dismiss the event as unremarkable and discourage deeper analysis or discussion.
16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on the topic of the personnel changes at the State Department and CIA and their implications. It does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the audience.
17. Straw men – No – The text directly attacks the individuals being appointed and the decision to appoint them, rather than misrepresenting and refuting an argument that was not made.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses its criticism on the current event and the people involved. It does not deflect this criticism by pointing to the alleged hypocrisy of an opponent.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint. This is evident from the outset with the title "From Bad To Worse?", which frames the entire article. The piece selectively uses sources, relying exclusively on critics of the administration like Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald, whose opinions are presented as authoritative facts. It employs a wide array of propaganda techniques, including loaded language ("horrific torture," "criminal activity"), name-calling ("un-American," "actual torturer"), appeals to fear ("it's about to get a lot worse"), and even a Reduction ad Hitlerum by quoting a reference to Nazi insignia. The author uses bandwagon phrases ("many of us are concerned") to create a sense of shared outrage. By presenting a one-sided narrative devoid of any counter-arguments or neutral perspectives, the text aims to manipulate the reader's emotions and solidify a predetermined conclusion rather than encouraging critical thought.
