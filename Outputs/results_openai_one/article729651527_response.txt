Verdict – 30% – The text contains some elements that could be considered propaganda, such as doubt, loaded language, and appeal to authority. However, these elements are not overwhelmingly present, and the text primarily reports on events and responses related to anti-Semitism allegations at McGill. The presence of these techniques suggests a moderate likelihood of propaganda, but the overall tone and content appear to focus on presenting a narrative rather than overtly persuading the audience.
