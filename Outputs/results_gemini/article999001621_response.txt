1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels journalist Luke Harding a “notorious fraud, a russo-phobe intelligence asset” and a “plagiarizer.” The Guardian’s reporting is called “shoddier” and its stories are described as “cranky identity grievances.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the phrase “fake news” and reiterates the central message that The Guardian and “western main stream media” cannot be trusted and are outlets for propaganda.

3. Slogans – Yes – The title, “This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted,” functions as a brief, memorable phrase that encapsulates the entire argument of the article.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states that the reality of modern journalism is “bone-chilling” and warns that powerful, unseen forces (“British intelligence services”) are concocting stories, creating a sense of fear that the public is being systematically deceived.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is designed to cast doubt on the credibility of The Guardian, its journalists, and the mainstream media as a whole, stating, “Unfortunately no western main stream media can any longer be trusted to publish the truth.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by claiming The Guardian uses “fascist propaganda tropes” and “Goebbels' cartoons,” which is an extreme accusation. It minimizes the possibility of journalistic error, instead insisting the story was a “willful fake” and a deliberate “disinformation operation.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to an anti-establishment identity by framing the conflict as one between the people and the corrupt “ruling ‘western interests’,” the “UK intelligence apparatus,” and the “neoliberal order.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as “smear,” “vilify,” “deceit,” “bone-chilling,” “manipulative propaganda,” and “notorious fraud,” to create a negative emotional response towards its targets.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text explicitly disapproves of The Guardian by associating it with Nazis: “We have previously shown that the Guardian even uses fascist propaganda tropes to smear the Russian people. It is openly publishing Goebbels' cartoons and rhetoric…”

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that all intelligent or informed people agree with its conclusion, stating that “several people who had followed the Russiagate fairytale ... were immediately suspicious” and that “most readers with functional critical thinking capacity may readily dismiss the Guardian’s smear.”

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for the Guardian's story: it is a “main outlet for British government disinformation operations.” This ignores more complex possibilities, such as poor sourcing or editorial mistakes, in favor of a single, conspiratorial cause.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague terms for the antagonists, such as “the establishment,” “elite-serving, western narrative,” and “ruling ‘western interests’,” without specifically defining who these entities are, creating a powerful but ill-defined enemy.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites and quotes sources presented as authorities to support its claims, including Glenn Greenwald, former Guardian writer Jonathan Cook, Disobedient Media, and its own previous articles (“an important Moon of Alabama piece”).

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between two extremes: either you believe the mainstream media, which is portrayed as completely corrupt and false, or you believe the author's narrative, which is presented as the absolute truth.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The title itself, “This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted,” presents its conclusion as an established fact, discouraging debate. The phrase “functional critical thinking capacity” is used to imply that anyone who disagrees is intellectually deficient.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the “Skripal affair” to establish a pattern of media deception, stating, “We have seen a similar pattern in the Skripal affair.” This distracts from the specific evidence of the Manafort story by introducing another complex issue without providing detailed proof within the article.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a Politico article that speculates the Guardian may have been duped by Russian disinformation. By attacking this speculative argument (a "straw man"), the author reinforces their own narrative that the deception originated from Western intelligence, not Russian.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges The Guardian with hypocrisy by pointing out inconsistencies in its defense, stating, “This defensive Guardian claim is, like its story, evidently completely false. Wikileaks publicly denied the Guardian's claims 90 minutes before the story was first published.” This focuses on the opponent's alleged hypocrisy to undermine their position.

---
Verdict – 95% – The text is a highly effective piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to objectively analyze a media failure but to persuade the reader of a specific, overarching worldview: that Western mainstream media is fundamentally corrupt and serves as a propaganda arm for state intelligence. The article systematically employs a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. It uses emotionally charged and insulting language (Name-calling, Loaded Language), makes extreme comparisons (Reduction ad Hitlerum), and simplifies a complex event into a conspiracy (Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy). It builds its own credibility by appealing to like-minded authorities (Appeal to Authority) and suggesting that all critical thinkers are on its side (Bandwagon). While it is dissecting a real news story and pointing out verifiable errors made by The Guardian, it frames these facts within a rigid, persuasive, and non-falsifiable narrative of deliberate, malicious deception orchestrated by a vague but powerful "establishment," which is the hallmark of propaganda.
