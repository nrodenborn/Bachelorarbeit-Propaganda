Certainly! Here is the analysis of each propaganda technique, according to your instructions:

---

1. **Name calling** – Yes – The text refers to the migrants as an “invading” force and uses the term “invasion,” which is a negative and militaristic label.

3. **Slogans** – No – There is no brief, memorable phrase used as a rallying cry or slogan.
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the threat of an “invasion” and the need for military action, instilling fear about the migrants.
5. **Doubt** – Yes – The text says, “Anyone who doubts this is an invasion only need look at the size of the caravan,” questioning the credibility of those who might disagree.
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The text exaggerates the threat by describing the migrants as a massive, predominantly male force that will “overtake the border.”

**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, doubt, causal oversimplification, intentional vagueness, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. The language is emotionally charged, militaristic, and designed to provoke fear and patriotism, while oversimplifying the complexity of migration and border security. The use of authoritative quotes and repetition of key terms further reinforce the message. While not every possible technique is present, the density and variety of propaganda strategies strongly indicate that the text is intended to persuade through manipulation rather than balanced reporting.
