### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **No**  
   *Explanation:* The text refers to Quentin Lamar Smith as "black gunman" and "perp," but these are descriptive (albeit emotionally charged) rather than explicit insulting labels like "terrorist" or "monster."

2. **Repetition** – **No**  
   *Explanation:* Key details (officers' names, suspect's identity) are repeated, but this serves factual reporting, not propagandistic reinforcement.

3. **Slogans** – **Yes**  
   *Example:* "#WestervilleStrong"  
   *Explanation:* This hashtag is a brief, memorable phrase encouraging unity and resilience, fitting the "slogan" technique.

4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes**  
   *Example:* "I can't think of anything less irrelevant than a black gunman shooting two white cops—after five years of the 'Black Lives Matter' movement."  
   *Explanation:* Implicitly links the shooting to racial tensions and BLM, invoking fear of societal conflict.

5. **Doubt** – **Yes**  
   *Example:* "A reminder that the Associated Press has an official policy of 'not reporting race' when it's not 'relevant'."  
   *Explanation:* Questions the credibility of the AP’s editorial policy, implying bias or concealment.

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes**  
   *Example:* "I can't think of anything less irrelevant than a black gunman shooting two white cops."  
   *Explanation:* Exaggerates the centrality of race in the incident, framing it as supremely "relevant" beyond objective facts.

7. **Flag-Waving** – **No**  
   *Explanation:* No overt appeals to patriotism or national identity.

8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes**  
   *Example:* "black gunman," "perp," "murdered" (vs. "killed").  
   *Explanation:* Emotionally charged terms emphasizing race and criminality to evoke outrage.

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No**  
   *Explanation:* No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.

10. **Bandwagon** – **No**  
    *Explanation:* No appeal to popularity or trends.

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes**  
    *Example:* Linking the shooting to BLM: "after five years of the 'Black Lives Matter' movement."  
    *Explanation:* Implies BLM directly influenced the crime, ignoring complex socio-legal factors.

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No**  
    *Explanation:* Details are specific (names, dates, charges); no deliberate confusion.

13. **Appeal to authority** – **No**  
    *Explanation:* No authoritative sources cited to validate claims.

14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes**  
    *Example:* "I can't think of anything less irrelevant than a black gunman shooting two white cops."  
    *Explanation:* Presents race as the *only* relevant factor, dismissing other contexts (e.g., domestic violence history).

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No**  
    *Explanation:* No phrases like "common sense" or "it is what it is" to halt debate.

16. **Red herring** – **Yes**  
    *Example:* Introducing BLM and AP’s race-reporting policy.  
    *Explanation:* Distracts from the crime’s specifics (domestic violence, prior police interactions) with unrelated racial/political discourse.

17. **Straw men** – **Yes**  
    *Example:* Framing AP’s policy as hiding race when "irrelevant," then declaring race supremely relevant.  
    *Explanation:* Misrepresents AP’s nuanced policy to attack it as illogical or biased.

18. **Whataboutism** – **No**  
    *Explanation:* No accusations of hypocrisy against critics.

### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Selective Framing**: Focuses on the suspect’s race ("black gunman") while omitting his prior domestic violence history (detailed in AP reports) to fit a racial narrative.  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language ("murdered," "perp") and slogans (#WestervilleStrong) exploit outrage and tribalism.  
3. **Distortion of Facts**: Uses exaggeration, causal oversimplification, and straw men to falsely link the crime to BLM and discredit the AP.  
4. **Agenda-Driven Omissions**: Downplays the domestic violence context (the original 911 call) to emphasize racial conflict.  
5. **Multiple Propaganda Techniques**: At least 8 techniques are employed (e.g., slogans, loaded language, red herring), indicating systematic persuasion over impartial reporting.  

While based on real events, the text manipulates details to advance a divisive narrative about race, media, and policing, aligning with ideological agendas rather than neutral journalism.
