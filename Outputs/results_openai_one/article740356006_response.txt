**Verdict – 80% – The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, black & white fallacy, red herring, straw men, and whataboutism. These techniques are used to shape the reader's perception of Rep. Danny Davis and his relationship with Louis Farrakhan, as well as to criticize the Democratic Party. The presence of these techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is intended to persuade or manipulate the audience's opinion rather than present an unbiased account.**
