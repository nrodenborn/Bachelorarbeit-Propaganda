1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the Syrian government a "ruthless regime" and refers to a faction of political opponents as the "U.S. War Party."

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the justification and authority for the U.S. military presence in Syria through a series of rhetorical questions, such as "by what authority do U.S. forces remain...?", "But who authorized this strategic commitment...?", and "Who sanctioned this commitment...?".

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the phrase "no more unnecessary wars," a political slogan, to frame the current policy as a betrayal of a promise.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns of a "clash with the U.S. is coming" and asks, "Are we prepared for a shooting war with a Syrian army, backed by Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and Shiite militias...?" to instill fear of the consequences of current U.S. policy.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text is constructed to cast doubt on the U.S. government's strategy and honesty, asking, "Have the American people been had again?" and questioning the wisdom of the Kurds' alliance with the U.S. by pointing to a past betrayal.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes American interests in the region with the absolute statement, "While our 'allies' and adversaries have vital interests there, we do not."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the identity and will of the American people by stating, "Again and again, the American people have said they do not want to be dragged into Syria's civil war."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like "crushing of ISIS," "mortal peril," "ruthless regime," and "blatant attack" to influence the reader's perception.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any group or idea to the Nazis or other groups widely hated by the target audience.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that because "the American people have said they do not want to be dragged into Syria's civil war," the reader should also adopt this popular opinion.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex reasons for U.S. foreign policy by attributing it to a "U.S. War Party" that wants to "smash Iran and remain in the Middle East forever."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's position and argument are direct and clear, not intentionally vague or confusing.

13. Appeal to authority – No – While the text quotes authorities like presidents and secretaries, it does so to present their positions as facts to be argued against, not as evidence to support the author's own conclusion.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between immediate withdrawal and a "major U.S. war," ignoring other potential diplomatic or strategic outcomes.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the label "U.S. War Party" to dismiss an opposing viewpoint without engaging its substance, and the phrase "no more unnecessary wars" to shut down debate on whether this particular action might be considered necessary by some.

16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on the central topic of U.S. involvement in Syria. The reference to Afghanistan is used as a relevant analogy, not a distraction.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author characterizes the aims of those supporting the U.S. presence as wanting to "smash Iran and remain in the Middle East forever to assure the hegemony of its favorites," a caricature that is easier to attack than the official, more nuanced policy goals.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges the U.S. with hypocrisy by asking if the Syrian Kurds have considered what happened to the Iraqi Kurds, who "were themselves driven out of Kirkuk by the Iraqi army, as their U.S. allies watched."

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. While it is structured around factual events—such as troop movements and direct quotes from political leaders—its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific anti-interventionist viewpoint. The author achieves this by employing a very high density of propaganda techniques. The entire piece is framed to create fear of an imminent and disastrous war (Appeal to Fear), to cast doubt on the competence and honesty of the U.S. government (Doubt, Whataboutism), and to create a sense of solidarity with the supposedly duped "American people" (Flag-Waving, Bandwagon). The language is emotionally charged (Loaded Language), and opposing viewpoints are dismissed using simplistic and pejorative labels ("U.S. War Party") and caricatured arguments (Straw Men). By presenting the situation as a simple choice between a catastrophic war and the author's preferred policy, it utilizes a Black & White Fallacy. The sheer number and combination of these techniques, woven into a narrative of impending doom and government betrayal, move the text from a simple opinion piece to a highly effective work of propaganda.
