### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "anti-American" (used to describe the AMA).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" repeated three times in the poll.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "take the guns first" (quoting Trump to summarize AMA's stance).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "infringe on the rights of those who don’t commit crimes and need a gun to protect themselves" (fear of losing self-defense rights).  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "the majority of people at the AMA probably couldn’t tell you any of these devices" (questions AMA’s credibility on firearms).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "as anti-American as it comes" (exaggerates AMA’s stance as treasonous).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "uphold the law which protects the God-given rights of law-abiding citizens" (appeals to American identity/rights).  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "government overreach," "unconstitutional legislation," "stupid people" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis/hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "pull a Dick’s Sporting Goods" (implies AMA follows a popular anti-gun trend).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – "if we do that, we won’t have to worry about mass shooters, right? Wrong" (reduces gun control to an ineffective solution).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – "high or imminent risk for violence" (vague criteria for gun confiscation).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – No authoritative figures cited to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – "anti-constitutional and anti-American" (frames AMA as un-American for opposing gun rights).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "plain and simple" (dismisses AMA’s motives without elaboration).  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – "people are dying by the hundreds of thousands at the hands of drugs approved by the FDA" (diverts to Big Pharma instead of addressing gun policies).  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – "they don’t used the word 'epidemic'... though they are on record saying gun violence is a public health crisis" (misrepresents AMA’s position).  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – "Where is Berg’s blog post on [FDA]?" (accuses AMA of hypocrisy for not targeting Big Pharma).

### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation:
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of emotional manipulation, distortion, and fallacious reasoning to advance a specific agenda against the AMA’s gun control policies. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional Language**: Loaded terms ("anti-American," "Socialist," "stupid people") demonize the AMA.  
- **Fallacies**: Straw men (misrepresenting AMA’s expertise), whataboutism (deflecting to Big Pharma), and black/white framing (AMA = unconstitutional).  
- **Fear & Patriotism**: Appeals to fear of government overreach and loss of rights, wrapped in patriotic rhetoric ("God-given rights," "constitutional militia").  
- **Distraction**: Red herrings (FDA criticism) and repetition (corrupt politician poll) divert from substantive debate.  
- **Oversimplification**: Dismisses complex policy solutions (e.g., gun violence restraining orders) as inherently tyrannical.  
- **Bias**: Selectively quotes AMA policies while ignoring public health framing, focusing exclusively on perceived threats to gun rights.  

While the text cites factual AMA policies, it twists their intent, omits context (e.g., suicide prevention efforts), and substitutes evidence with emotive attacks. The sheer density of propaganda techniques (15/18 identified) confirms a deliberate persuasive aim over balanced discourse.
