Verdict – 25% – The text is primarily a factual news report, providing statistics and citing official sources. However, it crosses into persuasive territory through its consistent use of Loaded Language ("devastated," "wrath," "struggling," "devastating news") designed to evoke a strong emotional response of sympathy and concern from the reader. While the use of Appeal to Authority is present (quoting the governor), this is also a standard practice in journalism to establish credibility. The overwhelming absence of other manipulative techniques means it is not a piece of overt propaganda, but its emotionally charged framing gives it a persuasive and non-neutral tone, leaning it slightly towards advocacy journalism rather than purely objective reporting.
