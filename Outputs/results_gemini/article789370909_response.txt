1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack opponents, for example, by referring to them as "Haters of Judge Kavanaugh" and diagnosing them with "Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome."

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the phrase "character assassination" to describe the actions of Judge Kavanaugh's opponents, reinforcing a specific, negative framing of their motives.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text employs the memorable and dismissive phrase "Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome" to label and ridicule opposition to the nominee.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests a frightening consequence if the opposition succeeds, stating, "Placing the burden on Judge Kavanaugh to prove that he was not involved... turns the fundamental constitutional principle of due process upside down."

5. Doubt – Yes – The text is almost entirely dedicated to questioning the credibility of the accusers. For example, it states that for one accuser, "her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the efforts of the committee chairman, stating he has "bent over backwards to accommodate Ms. Ford’s preferred scheduling," while minimizing the accusations by repeatedly calling them unsubstantiated.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national values by stating, "In a nation guided by fairness and law, a person is innocent until proven guilty," using this principle to support its argument.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as describing the accusations as "salacious" and the opposition's campaign as one of "no-holds barred character assassination."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other groups widely hated by the audience.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular; rather, it frames its position as being under attack by a vocal opposition.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex series of events to a single, simple cause: "Democrats are pulling out all the stops and enabling salacious last-minute accusations against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh in order to sink his candidacy."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; it is very direct and clear in its accusations and its point of view.

13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does not use an authority's support as evidence for its claims. It mentions a psychiatrist only to immediately discredit his opinion.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between two extremes: either Kavanaugh is the victim of a malicious political "character assassination," or he is guilty, ignoring any other possibilities or nuances. For example: "Proof does not matter to those wanting to bring Judge Kavanaugh down at any cost."

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases to shut down debate, such as invoking "innocent until proven guilty" not as a legal standard for a trial, but as a rule to dismiss the legitimacy of the accusations in a confirmation hearing context.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces irrelevant and distracting information by mentioning "the ever-present Michael Avenatti, attorney of porn star Stormy Daniels," which serves to create a negative association that is unrelated to the specific accusations from Ford or Ramirez.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a distorted version of the opposition's argument, claiming, "Judge Kavanaugh should have to prove that he is not guilty, they are in effect insisting," which oversimplifies and misrepresents the argument about the appropriate standard of evidence for a confirmation hearing.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy on other, unrelated matters.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a balanced or objective piece of reporting but a highly persuasive opinion piece that systematically employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to advocate for a specific conclusion. The author uses emotionally charged and loaded language ("salacious," "smears," "bludgeon"), name-calling ("haters," "Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome"), and repetition ("character assassination") to frame Judge Kavanaugh's opponents in a purely negative light. The entire piece is an exercise in casting doubt on the accusers' credibility while simultaneously presenting a causal oversimplification that the events are nothing more than a political plot. It constructs a black & white fallacy of an innocent man under siege by malicious actors, uses straw man arguments to misrepresent their positions, and appeals to patriotic values (flag-waving) to bolster its own stance. The sheer number and consistent application of these techniques demonstrate a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than inform it.
