1. Name calling – Yes – The text attacks the subjects with insulting labels such as "illegal aliens" and "less glamorous illegal aliens."
2. Repetition – Yes – The phrase "illegal aliens" is repeated multiple times to reinforce a negative framing of the individuals involved.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief, memorable phrase as a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states, "If you legalize them, you move closer to legalizing all illegals," which instills fear of a slippery slope or a future with uncontrolled immigration.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the DACA program by stating the distinction between DREAMERs and other immigrants "has always been a matter of rhetoric, not substance."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the actions of two individuals to make the sweeping generalization that "DREAMERs continue violating the law," applying the actions of a few to an entire group.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language like "illegal aliens" and "illegal amnesty" to evoke a negative emotional response from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text uses two specific criminal incidents to suggest that the DACA policy itself is the simple cause for a broader trend of law-breaking ("DREAMERs continue violating the law").
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its messaging and does not use intentionally vague expressions.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites "Customs and Border Protection" and "Border Patrol agents" to lend authority and credibility to the factual claims about the arrests.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy where individuals are either legal or part of a criminal "industry," stating the distinction between DACA recipients and others is "rhetoric, not substance," which erases any nuance.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to end discussion.
16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central topic and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an unstated argument that all DACA recipients are perfectly law-abiding. By highlighting two who committed crimes, it attacks this extreme position rather than engaging with the actual, more nuanced arguments for the DACA policy.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect blame by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the audience to adopt a negative viewpoint towards DACA recipients and the DACA policy. While it is based on a factual event (the arrest of two individuals), it frames this event using a significant number of propaganda techniques. The most prominent are loaded language ("illegal aliens," "illegal amnesty") and name-calling ("less glamorous illegal aliens") to dehumanize the subjects. It employs exaggeration and causal oversimplification by using the actions of two people to make a broad, negative claim about an entire group of hundreds of thousands ("DREAMERs continue violating the law"). Furthermore, it uses appeal to fear to warn of future negative consequences and a black & white fallacy to eliminate any nuance in the debate. An objective news report would state the facts of the arrests without the editorializing, generalizations, and politically charged framing.
