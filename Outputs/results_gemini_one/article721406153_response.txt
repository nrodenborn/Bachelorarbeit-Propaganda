Name calling – Yes – The text attacks its subjects with insulting labels, such as calling Cardinal Müller "endlessly double-talking," Pope Francis a "wayward Roman Pontiff," his actions a "five-year-long tirade," and his supporters "knowing dupes" who defend "neo-Pharisaical sophistry."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the rhetorical question "Do they think we are fools?" in various forms throughout the piece to reinforce the idea that the audience is being deceived. Examples include the title "Apparently, They Think We are Fools," the question "Do they think we are fools?," and "Does Cardinal Müller think we are fools?"

Slogans – Yes – The text mockingly uses the phrase "Authentic Magisterium®" as a slogan to sarcastically label and dismiss Pope Francis's teachings as if they were a fraudulent commercial product.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text seeks to instill fear by describing a "program of moral subversion," an "unparalleled debacle for the Church," and "blows now raining down against the Church," framing the situation as a dire crisis for the faith.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is designed to cast doubt on the credibility and orthodoxy of Pope Francis and his collaborators. The central, repeated question, "Do they think we are fools?" directly questions their motives and intelligence.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to heighten the sense of crisis, describing a theological argument as a "lie from the pit of hell" and the current situation as a "ferocious attack from the very vertices of the Church."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the identity of traditionalist Catholics by invoking phrases like "the entire Tradition of the Catholic and Apostolic faith" and urging the audience to "keep the Faith," positioning them as the true defenders of Catholicism against internal corruption.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to provoke a negative reaction, such as "conspiracy," "moral subversion," "outrageous opinion," "verbal contortions," and "preposterous 'solution'."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparison to Hitler or the Nazis. While it does use an association fallacy by comparing the Pope's faction to the "Pharisees," it does not employ the specific "ad Hitlerum" technique.

Bandwagon – No – The text does the opposite of a bandwagon appeal. It portrays its audience as a righteous minority ("But we are not fools") standing against a powerful and corrupt mainstream, appealing to a sense of elite defiance rather than popular opinion.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies complex theological and administrative decisions into a single, malicious cause. For example, it states that Cardinal Burke was sacked "because he was a major impediment to the conspiracy culminating in Amoris Laetitia (AL)."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's writing is direct and clear in its accusations. It accuses its opponents of using vague language (e.g., an "ill-defined 'process of discernment'"), but does not use the technique itself.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses Cardinal Burke and Father Brian Harrison as authorities to legitimize its argument against Pope Francis and Cardinal Müller. It quotes Cardinal Burke at length, presenting him as the voice of true doctrine: "Cardinal Burke... has observed the obvious in this regard: Such cases do not exist."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a stark choice with no middle ground: one either defends "the Faith" and "Tradition" (the author's position) or one is a "knowing dupe" participating in "moral subversion."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that discourage further thought, such as "God will not be mocked," which is presented as a final, divine judgment that ends all debate.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the tangential issue of Catholic Answers and the "pro-homosexual bishop Francis has installed in San Diego" to generate further outrage and distract from the central argument about marriage and communion.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. It refutes Father Chiodi's nuanced position that contraception *could be* an "act of responsibility" in some cases by distorting it into the much more extreme claim that he "declares openly that there is a duty to contracept!"

Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges Pope Francis with hypocrisy by stating that he "continues his five-year-long tirade against the imaginary Catholic Pharisees" while he and his collaborators are "busily engineering neo-Pharisaical escape hatches."

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. It is not a reasoned argument but a polemic designed to persuade a specific audience through emotional manipulation rather than objective facts. The author systematically employs a vast array of propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, loaded language, and straw men, to vilify Pope Francis and his allies. The piece creates a stark black-and-white narrative of a "ferocious attack" on the Church from within, simplifying complex theological issues into a malicious "conspiracy." By appealing to the identity of traditionalist Catholics and using counter-authorities like Cardinal Burke, it aims to solidify opposition and delegitimize the current Church leadership. The sheer density and deliberate use of these techniques confirm its primary purpose as persuasion and incitement, not information or balanced debate.
