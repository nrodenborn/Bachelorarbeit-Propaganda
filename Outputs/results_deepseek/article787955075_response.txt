Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "disgraced FBI figures Peter Strzok and Lisa Page". The label "disgraced" is an insulting term applied to them.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – While the declassification order is mentioned multiple times, the core message isn't repeated verbatim in a propagandistic way. It's reportorial context.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans are present.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – The text doesn't explicitly try to instill fear about alternatives to support an idea.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "it is safe to say that Democrats are probably panicking right about now." This questions the Democrats' credibility and motives without evidence.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "Democrats are probably panicking right about now" is an unsubstantiated exaggeration of the Democrats' likely reaction.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No overt appeal to patriotism or national identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "disgraced FBI figures", "so incredibly stupid", "mockery it made out of the Constitution", "wrongdoing", "probably panicking". These terms carry strong negative connotations and appeal to emotion.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No attempt to link ideas to universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to the popularity of the declassification order itself.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Carter Page attributes broad damage ("all the damage that this did to the U.S. government [and] the mockery it made out of the Constitution") solely to the investigation into him, oversimplifying complex events and consequences.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text reports specific documents and sources (though the source for timing is anonymous, which is common reporting, not necessarily propagandistic obfuscation here).
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – While officials are quoted (Sanders, Carter Page), their statements are presented as information or opinion, not primarily as authoritative proof for a broader claim within the text's framing.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – The text doesn't present only two stark choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Carter Page's quote "so incredibly stupid to begin with" and his broad condemnation of "wrongdoing" serve to shut down critical analysis of the investigation's validity or purpose.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on the declassification order and reactions to it. Carter Page's quote is relevant context as the subject of the surveillance.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text doesn't refute an argument not presented.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No charges of hypocrisy are made against opponents.

**Verdict – 40% –** The text exhibits several propaganda techniques (Name calling, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Thought-terminating clichés), primarily through the selective use of charged language ("disgraced," "panicking") and the inclusion of Carter Page's highly opinionated and oversimplifying quote without critical counterpoint. This injects significant bias and frames the story negatively towards the investigation and Democrats. However, the core structure reports factual events (Trump's order, documents involved, sources like Sanders and Fox News reports) and includes some neutral reporting elements. The propagandistic elements are woven into an otherwise news-reporting framework, making it partially but not overwhelmingly propaganda. The sourcing from Fox News and the inclusion of Page's quote to Hannity also align with a specific partisan perspective.
