Name calling – Yes – The text directly calls the staffer a "useful idiot" and quotes another staffer calling Gillum and his allies "a part of the crazy, crazy, crazies."

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use or promote any brief, memorable phrases as a rallying cry.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text introduces a poll about a "caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border" and asks if "military force should be used to stop" it, which is designed to instill fear about immigration. It also frames Gillum's gun control stance as him considering "Americans as criminals," creating fear among gun owners.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is designed to cast doubt on Andrew Gillum's honesty and his platform, stating, "Of course, anyone following what Gillum has been promoting knows he isn't planning on delivering just like many politicians."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates Gillum's position on firearms by claiming he "is not a lawful man" and "considers Americans as criminals who need to prove their innocence before obtaining a gun."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific American identity by focusing on the "right to keep and bear arms" and framing Gillum as a threat to it, a common patriotic touchstone.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical terms to influence the audience, such as "George Soros-backed," "cracker state," and "corruption."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text uses the phrase, "Of course, anyone following what Gillum has been promoting knows he isn't planning on delivering," which suggests that all informed people already agree with the author's conclusion, encouraging the reader to join the consensus.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text makes a logical leap by stating, "...one can then conclude that Gillum knows about Smith's racism and keeps him on staff anyway." This presents a simple, damning conclusion for a situation where the reality could be far more complex.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; its accusations and intent are very direct and clear.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents "Project Veritas," a group known for undercover videos, as a credible authority whose findings should be accepted as truth. Example: "In a new undercover video from Project Veritas, Omar Smith..."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll about the migrant caravan presents only two extreme options: "Yes, military force should be used" or "No, keep the military out of it," ignoring all other potential diplomatic or humanitarian responses.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "OK, we know that..." is used after presenting a quote, treating a contentious point as an established fact to shut down further thought and move to the next attack.

Red herring – Yes – The poll about the migrant caravan is entirely unrelated to the topic of Andrew Gillum's staffer and his campaign promises. It is inserted to distract the reader and provoke an emotional reaction on a different issue.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument Gillum never made by claiming he "considers Americans as criminals who need to prove their innocence before obtaining a gun." This misrepresents his likely position on gun control (e.g., waiting periods) as an extreme viewpoint that is easy to attack.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects from Gillum's claims that his opponent is a racist by changing the subject, stating, "...but the video demonstrates the utter racism of Smith," thereby charging Gillum's campaign with hypocrisy instead of addressing his original claim.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and unambiguous example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt an extremely negative view of Andrew Gillum by employing a dense and varied arsenal of propaganda techniques. The article systematically uses loaded language ("George Soros-backed"), name-calling ("useful idiot"), and appeals to fear (the migrant caravan poll) to provoke an emotional, rather than rational, response. It relies heavily on logical fallacies, including a blatant red herring (the caravan poll), a straw man (the characterization of Gillum's gun control stance), and causal oversimplification (concluding Gillum must be aware of his staffer's "racism"). The piece completely lacks journalistic objectivity, presenting no alternative viewpoints, context, or verification of the claims made in the selectively edited video. The sheer number of techniques used in such a short text confirms that it was constructed as a piece of political propaganda.
