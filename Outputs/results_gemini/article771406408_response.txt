1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the official response to the murder as a "tragic comedy of denial" and a "tired farce," and calls the system that protects the killer "crazy."
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the killer is being protected by the system and that this is a recurring pattern is repeated throughout the text, for example with phrases like "This just continues the pattern" and "the system that keeps on protecting him is."
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase "Allahu Akbar usually means motive unknown" is used as a brief, memorable, and sarcastic phrase to summarize the author's argument about the authorities' alleged denial.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text describes a violent murder and suggests the authorities are letting the killer "get away with it," which can instill fear in the reader that the system will not protect them from similar attacks.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text constantly questions the credibility of the French authorities and the legal process, for instance, with statements like "The authorities stonewalled at every turn" and the sarcastic remark, "Sure he was crazy."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration with the claim "Every other Muslim terrorist or killer in Europe has his actions blamed on mental illness or drug use." It also minimizes the possibility of genuine mental illness by sarcastically dismissing it: "Sure he was crazy."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to identity by repeatedly highlighting the victim's Jewishness ("Elderly Jewish Woman," "Orthodox Jewish nursery") and the killer's Muslim faith ("Muslim killer," "chanting Muslim prayers"), framing the event around group identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "violently beaten," "begged her Muslim killer to spare her life," and "tragic comedy of denial" to evoke strong emotional responses from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of a separate idea by suggesting it is popular with a hated group; rather, it directly condemns the actions of an individual and a system.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is true because it is popular; in fact, it positions its own viewpoint as being contrary to the official narrative.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex legal and psychiatric proceedings into a single cause: a deliberate effort by "the system" to protect a Muslim killer, dismissing any other potential factors like genuine psychosis with the line "Kobili isn't crazy. But the system that keeps on protecting him is."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and point of view. It accuses the authorities of vagueness ("for some unclear reason") but does not use this technique itself.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the victim's son and brother as authorities to establish the killer's history of anti-Semitism: "Yonathan Halimi, Sarah Lucy’s son, describes the killer’s family as being known for its anti-Semitism."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two possibilities: either the killer is a sane, hate-filled murderer, or he is "crazy." It dismisses the latter as a "tired farce," leaving only the author's interpretation as the single valid option.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "This just continues the pattern" is used to frame the event as one of many, discouraging specific analysis of the case in favor of accepting a pre-established narrative.
16. Red herring – No – The text remains highly focused on the central topic of the murder and the perceived failures of the justice system; it does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – No – The text directly engages with and attempts to refute the official legal finding (that the killer was unfit to stand trial due to his mental state), rather than creating a false or weaker argument to attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses its criticism entirely on the French authorities and the handling of this specific case. It does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of a different wrongdoing.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. While based on a real and tragic event, its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly emotional, and critical viewpoint. It achieves this by employing a large number of propaganda techniques. The narrative is constructed using loaded language, appeals to fear, and name-calling to create an immediate emotional response of anger and injustice. It then uses causal oversimplification and a black & white fallacy to present a simple, digestible narrative: an evil, sane killer is being deliberately protected by a corrupt system. The author systematically casts doubt on all official institutions (police, judiciary, psychiatry) while using appeals to the authority of the victim's family to bolster their own narrative. The use of exaggeration ("Every other Muslim...") and thought-terminating clichés ("This just continues the pattern") serves to reinforce a pre-existing worldview rather than encourage critical examination of the specific case. A neutral report would have presented the facts, the court's findings and reasoning, and the family's counter-arguments without the pervasive use of sarcastic, accusatory, and emotionally manipulative language. This text, by contrast, is a polemic designed to provoke outrage and confirm a bias.
