Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques used in the text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "Synodal Schemers" (referring to Francis and his collaborators), "homosexual network of clergy and prelates", "predators and coverup enablers", "prolific serial predator".
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The phrase "How inconvenient that..." is repeated multiple times (at least 6 instances) to hammer home the point about scandals coinciding with the Synod.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "#StopTheSynod2018" and "#StopTheSynod" are used as brief, memorable rallying cries.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Warns of "serious moral and physical dangers" to youth attending the Synod, "moral and physical exploitation of the youth", "dark night of the soul", and "litany of lives of total moral, physical, emotional devastation".
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – Questions Farrell's awareness: "roomed with the notorious Cardinal Theodore McCarrick for six years and never knew anything about McCarrick’s predatory behavior."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – *Exaggeration:* "masterfully manipulated, rigged, and exploited"; "most prolific serial predator... in the history of the American Church"; "bankrupting the American Church". *Minimization:* Implies the Synod's stated goal ("listening to all the young people") is merely a cover for promoting a pro-LGBT agenda.
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Appeals to Catholic identity/tradition against perceived modernizations: "recantation of Church teaching on homosexuality", "nagging and unmerciful Catholic catechism doctrine", "relaxation of the Church teachings", "makes a mockery of the suffering", defending "Church’s teaching and moral stance".
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "manipulated, rigged, and exploited", "backdoor tactics and machinations", "synodal antics", "dirty secret", "predatory behavior", "sordid lifestyle", "total moral, physical, emotional devastation", "dark night", "flamboyantly flashing", "sneaky synodal tactics", "skewer the results", "stuff the ballot box".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – While highly critical, the text does not compare the subjects to Hitler, Nazis, or other universally despised groups like the Vichy example given.
10. **Bandwagon – Yes** – Promotes petitions (#StopTheSynod) and encourages readers to "sign and encourage your friends, contacts, and social media associates to do the same."
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Attributes the clergy abuse crisis primarily and almost solely to a "homosexual network" relaxing doctrine: "the underlying cause of the criminal scandal lies in the homosexual network"; "direct result of a clerical culture which embraced homosexuality".
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is highly polemical but generally direct and specific in its accusations and claims, not deliberately vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Cites the "Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report" multiple times as evidence supporting its claims about predation and cover-ups.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents the Synod as inherently dangerous exploitation that "must be cancelled", implying cancellation is the only acceptable action demonstrating "concern for the young" ("That is the only expression...").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Uses "Who Am I to Judge" (repeatedly) to dismiss nuanced discussion of homosexuality and clergy behavior, framing it as the root cause of the scandal. Also uses "code language" to dismiss the stated purpose of listening ("That’s code language that the Pope will be... hearing the pro-LBGT agenda").
16. **Red herring – No** – While connecting the Synod themes to the abuse scandal is the author's central argument, the link between "Youth and Vocations" and the abuse crisis is the *core focus*, not an irrelevant distraction. The arguments stay tightly linked to this connection.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Misrepresents the Synod's goal of listening ("listening to all the young people") as solely about promoting a pro-LGBT agenda ("That’s code language that the Pope will be “dialoging” and “accompanying” and “hearing” the pro-LBGT agenda").
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The text focuses criticism directly on Francis, Farrell, and the Synod process regarding the abuse scandal. It doesn't primarily deflect by charging *them* with hypocrisy relative to others, though it notes Farrell lived with McCarrick.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a wide array of propaganda techniques (at least 14 out of 18 identified) extensively throughout. The core message relies heavily on **Name-Calling**, **Loaded Language**, **Appeal to Fear**, and **Causal Oversimplification** to paint a dire picture of the Synod and Pope Francis's papacy, directly linking it to the clergy abuse crisis through an alleged "homosexual network." **Repetition** ("How inconvenient that...") and **Black & White Fallacy** (Synod=cancellation) reinforce the message simplistically. **Straw Men** misrepresent the Synod's intentions, while **Thought-Terminating Clichés** ("Who am I to judge") shut down counter-arguments. **Bandwagon** appeals rally readers to action (#StopTheSynod). While it raises serious issues (clergy abuse, cover-ups), the presentation is not a balanced examination. It's a polemic designed to evoke strong negative emotions (fear, outrage, distrust) against specific targets (Francis, Farrell, the Synod, homosexual clergy networks) and mobilize readers to oppose the Synod, using selective information, inflammatory rhetoric, and manipulative techniques rather than objective argumentation. The petition drive at the end confirms its activist, persuasive intent. The few techniques not strongly present (Reduction ad Hitlerum, Obfuscation, Red Herring, Whataboutism) do not diminish the overwhelming use of propaganda throughout the piece.
