1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the official story as a “pathetic attempt at a cover-up.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that helicopters were involved in the attack is repeated multiple times throughout the text, such as in the phrases “ignited the theory that helicopters were used” and “multiple other videos taken on the night of the attack also seem to point to helicopters being used.”
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear by suggesting a massive, violent conspiracy involving helicopters in a public massacre, and implies that the authorities are covering it up, leaving the public vulnerable and uninformed. For example, it mentions "a team was firing into the crowd from the air."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built around questioning the credibility of the official narrative, stating, “the fact remains that the official story has been proven, time and time again, to be absolutely false.” It also questions the FBI's investigation by noting they never saw or investigated the new footage.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of debris, calling it “astonishing” and “amazing” evidence for a hovering helicopter, while minimizing the complexity of the official investigation by calling it a simple “pathetic attempt at a cover-up.”
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “horrific attack,” “massacre,” and “pathetic attempt at a cover-up” to evoke an emotional response from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not associate any idea or group with Hitler or other hated figures.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests the helicopter theory is popular by stating that “many believe” that released videos show helicopters involved in the attack.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple cause (a hovering helicopter) for the complex observation of wind and debris, stating “apparently that is due to a helicopter hovering overhead,” ignoring other potential explanations.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague and non-committal language like “seems to show,” “possibility seems all the more plausible,” and “may show muzzle flashes” to create suspicion without making definitive claims.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Shepard Ambellas of Intellihub, and The Daily Sheeple as authorities to lend credibility to its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: the helicopter theory or the “official story,” which it labels as an “absolutely false” cover-up, ignoring any other possibilities or nuances.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The statement “the fact remains that the official story has been proven, time and time again, to be absolutely false” is a sweeping declaration intended to end discussion and discourage any critical examination of the official narrative.
16. Red herring – Yes – The point that the FBI never approached the camera owner is used to distract from the quality of the evidence itself and shift the focus to the alleged failures of the official investigation.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text brings up and refutes the argument that flashes from the helicopter are “‘strobes’,” an argument that was not presented in detail, in order to strengthen its own claim that they were muzzle flashes.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing its opponents of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and deliberate piece of propaganda. Its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific conspiracy theory by discrediting the official account of the Las Vegas shooting. It achieves this by employing an overwhelming number of propaganda techniques. The entire article is built on a foundation of **Doubt** and **Obfuscation**, using vague language ("seems to show," "may show") to create the impression of evidence without making concrete claims. It relies on **Appeals to (alternative) Authority** (Tucker Carlson, Intellihub) and the **Bandwagon** effect ("many believe") to build credibility for its theory. Simultaneously, it attacks the official narrative using **Name Calling** ("pathetic attempt at a cover-up"), a **Black & White Fallacy** (presenting only its theory and a "false" official story as options), and a **Thought-terminating Cliché** to shut down debate. The argument is further supported by logical fallacies like **Causal Oversimplification** (helicopter = debris) and **Straw Men**. The pervasive use of **Loaded Language** ("horrific," "massacre") and **Appeals to Fear** (a secret team firing from a helicopter) ensures the reader is emotionally manipulated rather than logically convinced. The sheer density of these techniques indicates that the text's purpose is persuasion and indoctrination, not objective journalism.
