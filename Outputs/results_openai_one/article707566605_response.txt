Verdict – 60% – The text contains several elements typical of propaganda, such as appeal to fear, repetition, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and appeal to authority. These techniques are used to emphasize the threat of antibiotic resistance and the potential for a global pandemic, which could be seen as an attempt to influence public perception and response to the outbreak. However, the text also includes expert opinions and factual information, which suggests it may not be purely propagandistic but rather a mix of informative content with some elements of propaganda.
