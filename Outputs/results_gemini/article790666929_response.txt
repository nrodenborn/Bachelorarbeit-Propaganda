1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels for the Democratic party, such as “corrupt party,” “Democrat machine,” and “lawless party.” The headline also refers to Keith Ellison as an “Accused Serial Woman Abuser.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase “Different rules for the lawless party” is a brief and memorable phrase used to summarize the author's viewpoint.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses more on creating anger and distrust towards a political party and individual rather than instilling fear in the audience about a specific negative outcome.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire introductory section about Barack Obama is designed to question the integrity and motives of the Democratic party by stating they have a history of using such tactics, as in “Obama and his corrupt party in Chicago somehow managed to unseal the divorce records of his opponent.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline calls Ellison an “Accused Serial Woman Abuser.” The word “serial” exaggerates the claims, as the text only details allegations from one ex-girlfriend.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use patriotic appeals or symbols to make its case.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “corrupt party,” “Democrat machine,” and “lawless party” to evoke negative emotions and stereotypes.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or person to groups like the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simplified reason for Barack Obama’s 2004 senate victory, stating that after the opponent’s divorce records were unsealed, “Ryan resigned. Obama took the field,” implying this was the sole cause for the win.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses the phrase “somehow managed to unseal” to describe how Obama’s party accessed the records, deliberately avoiding specifics to imply illicit or mysterious actions.
13. Appeal to authority – No – While the text mentions authorities like the Star Tribune, it is reporting on their actions rather than using their status as evidence to support the author's own claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the political landscape as a simple binary choice between the “lawless party” (Democrats) and an implied virtuous alternative, ignoring any nuance.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “Different rules for the lawless party” is used as a simplistic, conclusive statement that discourages further critical thought on the complexities of political tactics.
16. Red herring – Yes – The lengthy introduction about Barack Obama’s 2004 senate race is irrelevant to the main news story about Keith Ellison in 2018. It serves to distract and to frame the Ellison story within a narrative of Democratic hypocrisy.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent a specific opposing argument in order to refute it. Its attacks are more direct.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text uses the 2004 Obama/Ryan incident to counter the focus on Keith Ellison. The implicit argument is, “Why is this a big deal now when Democrats did the same thing before?” which is a classic whataboutism tactic to charge the opposition with hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly a piece of propaganda. While it is structured around a factual news event (the Star Tribune’s motion to unseal records), this core information is heavily framed by a biased and manipulative narrative. The piece begins with a significant red herring—the story of Barack Obama's 2004 campaign—which serves no purpose other than to establish a whataboutism argument and paint the Democratic party as hypocritical and corrupt from the outset. This is reinforced with highly emotional and biased language (name calling like “lawless party,” “Democrat machine”). The text employs numerous logical fallacies, such as causal oversimplification, and uses techniques like repetition and thought-terminating clichés to hammer its point home. The primary goal is not to inform the reader about the legal motion concerning Ellison's records, but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of Keith Ellison and the Democratic Party as a whole. The blending of some factual reporting with a large number of propaganda techniques is a hallmark of modern propaganda.
