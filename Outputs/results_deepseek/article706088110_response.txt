### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used for persuasion.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Example: "disappear into the almost 1 million illegal aliens absconding from Final Orders of Removal" (instills fear of loss of control over immigrants).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Example: "symptomatic of the lies from reporters like Raymond" (questions credibility of Reuters reporting).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Example: "almost 1 million illegal aliens absconding" (exaggerates scale without evidence); minimizes immigrants' due process claims as "sudden."

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to halt critical discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions introduced.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Opposing arguments (e.g., due process claims) are accurately represented.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy against opponents.  

### Verdict – 95% – 
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic, as it employs **7 of 18 techniques** (including high-impact methods like Name Calling, Loaded Language, and Appeal to Fear) to manipulate perception. Key indicators:  
- **Dehumanizing language**: Persistent use of "illegal aliens" and "Kritarch" to vilify immigrants and a judge.  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded terms (e.g., "scheming," "usurp") paint opponents as malicious.  
- **Selective framing**: Dismisses immigrants' due process claims as "sudden" while omitting context (e.g., policy shifts under Trump).  
- **Political agenda**: Explicit call to action ("Time for Congress to impeach Saris") reveals intent to sway policy through bias.  
The 5% uncertainty stems from factual elements (e.g., references to EOIR, Reuters) but these are weaponized to support a one-sided narrative, not balanced discourse. The text’s primary function is to provoke outrage against immigrants and the judiciary, aligning with propaganda’s core aim: influencing audiences through emotional persuasion over evidence.
