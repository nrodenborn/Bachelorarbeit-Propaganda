1. Name calling – Yes – The author labels journalists who are critical of Assange as “Vichy journalists — after the Vichy government that served and enabled the German occupation of wartime France.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that Julian Assange has committed no crime and is being unjustly persecuted is repeated multiple times, such as “The persecution of Julian Assange must end,” and “Julian Assange has committed no crime. He has never been charged with a crime.”

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses short, impactful phrases like “The persecution of Julian Assange must end” to create a memorable call to action.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that if the Australian government does not act, the situation “will end in tragedy” and that Assange faces “extreme danger” and potential torture if extradited to the U.S.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text systematically questions the credibility of those opposing Assange, such as Hillary Clinton: “She offered no evidence — nor was asked for any — to back her grave allegations.” It also calls the Swedish investigation “bogus and farcical.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author describes the attacks on Assange as “a tsunami of lies and smear” and claims “No investigative journalism in my lifetime can equal the importance of what WikiLeaks has done.” Conversely, it minimizes the Swedish allegations as a “bogus and farcical” episode.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text repeatedly appeals to Australian national identity and duty, urging the government to “bring this remarkable Australian citizen home” and fulfill its obligation to “protect Australian citizens abroad.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like “persecution,” “tragedy,” “tsunami of lies,” “vicious,” “vendetta,” “inhuman,” and “witch-hunt” to evoke strong feelings in the reader.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The author compares journalists critical of Assange to the Vichy government, which collaborated with Nazi Germany: “I call them Vichy journalists — after the Vichy government that served and enabled the German occupation of wartime France.”

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text states that Assange’s “courageous public service is recognised by countless people across the world,” suggesting his cause is popular and therefore correct.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex collapse of Libya and the subsequent refugee crisis almost entirely to one person: “Thanks largely to her [Hillary Clinton], Libya became a breeding ground for ISIS and other jihadists.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s language is generally direct and forceful, not intentionally vague or obscure. The points, while biased, are clearly stated.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites a “United Nations Special Rapporteur” who allegedly called Chelsea Manning’s treatment “torture” and quotes Nobel laureate Harold Pinter to lend credibility to its arguments.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two choices for the Australian government: “They can remain silent, for which history will be unforgiving. Or they can act in the interests of justice and humanity and bring this remarkable Australian citizen home.”

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not rely on stock clichés to end discussion; instead, it presents a detailed (though one-sided) argument to persuade the reader.

16. Red herring – Yes – The extensive and detailed critique of Hillary Clinton’s actions regarding Libya and Saudi Arabia, while used to discredit her, also serves to distract from the specific case against Assange by focusing on the perceived greater evils of his accuser.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text frames the entire case against Assange as a personal “smear” and a “war on... the very principle of freedom of speech,” refuting this simplified motive rather than engaging with potentially more complex counter-arguments related to national security or the methods of leaking.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – When discussing criticism of Assange from figures like Hillary Clinton or publications like The Guardian, the author consistently deflects by pointing out their own alleged wrongdoings or hypocrisy (e.g., Clinton’s role in Libya, The Guardian profiting from WikiLeaks).

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly a work of propaganda. It utilizes a vast majority of the propaganda techniques listed (16 out of 18) to construct a one-sided and emotionally manipulative narrative. The author’s stated goal is not to inform objectively but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint: that Julian Assange is a heroic martyr and his opponents are uniformly corrupt, malicious, and hypocritical.

The piece systematically employs techniques like loaded language (“persecution,” “witch-hunt”), name-calling (“Vichy journalists”), and appeals to fear (“it will end in tragedy”) to bypass rational analysis and provoke an emotional response. It creates a stark black-and-white fallacy where one must either support Assange completely or be complicit in his destruction. The arguments consistently rely on whataboutism and red herrings to deflect criticism of Assange and attack the character of his accusers rather than addressing the substance of their claims.

While the text contains factual elements (names, dates, quotes), they are selectively chosen and framed to support a single, unwavering conclusion. There is no attempt at balance, nuance, or exploration of alternative perspectives. Every sentence is engineered to reinforce the central message of Assange's sainthood and the villainy of his enemies, which is the defining characteristic of propaganda.
