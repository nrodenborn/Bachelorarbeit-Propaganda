### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "frivolous ruling" (attacking Judge Kelly's decision), "how Jim Acosta treated both Sarah Sanders... is a testimony to how little those who represent us know" (insulting Acosta and representatives).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The poll repeats "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL") are used.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Warns of a "dangerous precedent" and claims compliance shows ignorance of the Constitution, implying erosion of norms.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Questions credibility: "how little those who represent us know of our Constitution" (doubting officials' competence).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: "surreal," "frivolous ruling," and "ridiculous demand" exaggerate the court's actions; "simple human decency" minimizes Acosta's behavior.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to patriotism: "for any constitutionalist," "our Constitution," and "unconstitutional rulings."  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Emotionally charged terms like "dangerous precedent," "unprofessional behavior," "frivolous," and "testimony to how little."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis or hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Explanation: "We believe the overwhelming majority of journalists... share that preference" implies consensus.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Blames Acosta’s behavior as the sole reason for new rules, ignoring legal/political complexities.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Explanation: Threatens "more explicit rules" if behavior continues, without defining what triggers this.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Cites Sarah Sanders' statements as validation: "Sanders said in a statement."  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents "stop calling on them" as the only solution to handling journalists like Acosta.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Judge who should know better" shuts down critique of the ruling.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: The poll distracts from the legal debate by focusing on Acosta’s behavior.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: Claims CNN forced "explicit rules," framing their lawsuit as an attack on norms rather than press freedom.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy targeting opponents.

### Verdict – 95% – Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda**. It employs 15/18 identified techniques to manipulate perception, including:  
- **Emotional manipulation** (loaded language, appeal to fear, name-calling).  
- **Distortion of facts** (exaggeration, causal oversimplification, straw men).  
- **Suppression of dissent** (thought-terminating clichés, black/white fallacy).  
- **Appeals to tribal identity** (flag-waving, bandwagon).  
The core intent is to delegitimize a judicial ruling, attack critics (Acosta, CNN), and frame the White House as a victim forced into action. The poll and repetitive questioning serve to rally readers against perceived enemies, while omitting context about the legal basis for the court’s decision. The few absent techniques (e.g., Reduction ad Hitlerum) do not offset the overwhelming propagandistic tone.
