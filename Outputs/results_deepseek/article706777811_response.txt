Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the given text:

1.  **Name calling – No** – No insulting labels are applied to the subject (the plague) or those involved.
2.  **Repetition – No** – While key themes (spread, threat) are present, specific phrases or messages are not repeated verbatim enough times to qualify.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "ticking time bomb" and "100% likely" are brief, memorable phrases used to encapsulate the perceived threat.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – The text repeatedly emphasizes the deadliness, ease of spread ("airborne", "spreads easily", "kill within 48 hours"), potential to mutate ("become untreatable"), inevitable spread ("100 percent likely", "inevitable", "only a matter of time"), and potential global consequences ("decimate the world", "huge devastation", "get out of our control"). Example: "a ticking time bomb that’s waiting to decimate the world".
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – The text questions the initial control claimed by health officials: "The death toll... jumped for the first time since health officials claimed the infection was in the beginning stages of control."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration is evident in claims like "100 percent likely" (absolute certainty is rare), "decimate the world" (extreme consequence), and potentially presenting the overall threat level as more imminent and catastrophic than the counterpoint about treatability and low current risk might suggest. The scale ("worst outbreak in 50 years", "crisis point") also leans towards emphasizing severity.
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – No appeal to patriotism or national/group identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Emotionally charged words and phrases are used: "jumped", "picking up speed", "worst outbreak", "crisis point", "high alert", "blight", "chilling warning", "ticking time bomb", "decimate", "huge devastation".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No association with hated groups is made to disapprove of an idea.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – Popularity of the idea (the threat level) is not used as a reason to believe it.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – The spread to the UK/globally is primarily attributed to "the vast movement of people across the globe" ("Conroy warned it is inevitable that the plague will spread due to the vast movement of people across the globe."), simplifying a complex epidemiological process involving numerous factors (transmissibility, vectors, public health measures, environmental conditions, etc.).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The language, while alarming, is generally direct and clear about the claims being made (e.g., "100% likely", "airborne", "kill within 48 hours"). It doesn't rely on deliberately unclear expressions.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Statements and warnings from "Professor Paul Hunter" and "Richard Conroy" (founder of Sick Holiday) are used as evidence for the claims about spread and threat.
14. **Black & white fallacy – No** – While the threat is presented seriously, the text itself includes a counterpoint ("the current risk is low" due to treatability) and doesn't present only two absolute choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Phrases like "ticking time bomb" and "100 percent likely" are dramatic, memorable, and can discourage deeper critical analysis of the actual probability, mechanisms, and context by framing the issue in absolute, catastrophic terms.
16. **Red herring – No** – The text stays focused on the plague outbreak, its spread, and the threat. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men – No** – No misrepresented arguments are set up to be refuted.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – No charges of hypocrisy are made against opponents.

**Verdict – 75% –** The text exhibits significant elements of propaganda, primarily through its strong use of **Appeal to Fear**, **Loaded Language**, **Exaggeration**, **Appeal to Authority** (selectively emphasizing alarming viewpoints), **Causal Oversimplification**, and **Thought-terminating clichés**. While it reports factual elements (death tolls, WHO stats, existence of an outbreak, expert quotes), the overall framing is highly sensationalized. The use of definitive, catastrophic language ("100% likely", "decimate the world", "ticking time bomb") combined with the focus on worst-case scenarios and the downplaying of mitigating factors (treatability, low current risk mentioned almost as an afterthought) strongly suggests an intent to alarm and persuade the reader of an extreme, imminent threat beyond what a purely informational report would convey. The selective quoting of experts making the most dire predictions further supports this. However, the inclusion of *some* factual basis and a brief counterpoint prevents it from being rated as 100% propaganda.
