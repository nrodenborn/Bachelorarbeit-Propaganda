Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Senator Marco Rubio as a "RINO extraordinaire," which is an insulting political label ("Republican In Name Only").

Repetition – Yes – The question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times in a row as part of a poll.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to rally support.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text ends by suggesting that if Snipes is not arrested, "more people end up dead in Broward County over their corrupt voting practices," instilling fear of deadly consequences.

Doubt – Yes – The very first sentence, "Why she wasn't fired a long time ago is beyond anyone's ability to answer," is designed to cast doubt on the competence and integrity of the entire system that kept her in place.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the legal situation by stating Snipes' "arrest should be imminent" and that she "should be ready for prison bars," presenting a desired outcome as a certainty before any formal charges or trial.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as "fiasco," "botched," "blistering criticism," and "corrupt."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents the complex issues of a "tumultuous election recount" as being caused simply by one person's deliberate "voter fraud," stating it is "clearly voter fraud that she oversaw" and the "fiasco she has created."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; it is direct and makes very specific accusations.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites sources like Breitbart, Marco Rubio, and a Broward County employee's affidavit as evidence to support its claims of fraud.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents Brenda Snipes' actions as pure, malicious criminality that warrants prison, leaving no room for other possibilities such as incompetence, systemic failures, or administrative errors. This is also seen in the poll: "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass," which presents a false and loaded dichotomy.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use cliché phrases to shut down discussion.

Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of the poll, "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?", is a clear red herring. It is completely irrelevant to the topic of Brenda Snipes and the Florida election and serves only to distract the reader.

Straw men – Yes – The text states, "...but don't worry, a Democrat attorney says that doing so has nothing to do with fraud or corruption." It presents this simplified, unattributed opposing viewpoint and then implicitly dismisses it without engaging in the actual legal distinctions between administrative error and criminal fraud.

Whataboutism – No – The text attacks an opponent (Marco Rubio) but does not use this attack to deflect from a charge of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt an extreme and specific viewpoint by using a multitude of manipulative techniques. The article abandons journalistic neutrality from the first sentence, framing the subject, Brenda Snipes, as a guilty criminal. It heavily employs loaded language ("fiasco," "corrupt") and appeals to fear (predicting people will "end up dead") to provoke an emotional response rather than a rational one. The piece relies on logical fallacies like causal oversimplification, blaming a complex election process entirely on the malicious actions of one person, and a black & white fallacy, where the only option presented is her criminality. The use of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Jim Acosta poll) is a blatant attempt to distract and engage the reader on a separate, emotionally charged topic. While it does appeal to authority by citing sources, it does so selectively to build its one-sided case. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the audience's opinion, making it a textbook example of propaganda.
