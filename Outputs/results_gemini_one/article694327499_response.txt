1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents with insulting terms, such as calling Pope Francis a “cunning ecclesiastical politician,” his supporters “Bergoglio’s co-conspirators,” and a group of thinkers the “neo-Catholic establishment.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the sarcastic phrase “What the Pope Really Means®” to mock the attempt at reinterpretation. It also repeatedly insists that the proposed new translation makes the original problem “worse.”

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses short, punchy phrases to dismiss arguments, such as “Here we go again,” and “Give. Me. A. Break.”

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns of dire consequences, such as the “Bergoglian Mercy Train as it barrels toward a train wreck at the end of the line,” and describes the current situation as “ecclesial auto-demolition” and a “master plan to subvert the Church.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is an exercise in casting doubt on the credibility and motives of Pope Francis, Dr. Fastiggi, and Dr. Goldstein. For example: “Will this sop buy Burke’s silence, staving off the feared public correction? We will soon know if the Cardinal can be bought so easily.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the position of his opponents for effect: “All of the critics of AL are wrong—every one of them!—because, you see, the original Latin text does not say what the English text does.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific Catholic identity by positioning the author as one of the “lay and clerical defenders of the authentic Magisterium” and acting for the good of “Holy Mother Church.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as “outrageous proposition,” “perniciousness,” “synodal charade,” and “shameful defense of the indefensible.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses the defined technique by disapproving of the Pope’s actions by comparing him to a figure hated by the target audience: “he is very much in the mold of Honorius I, who was posthumously anathematized by an ecumenical council... for aiding and abetting the spread of the Monothelite heresy.”

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to popularity. Instead, it frames the author and their allies as a minority (“rising opposition”) standing against a powerful establishment.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents the complex situation surrounding the papal document as a simple, deliberate conspiracy: “confusion as a cover for the introduction of Holy Communion for ‘certain’ public adulterers... is exactly what he was aiming to achieve from the beginning of the whole synodal charade.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author of this text is not vague; their purpose is to be very clear in their condemnation. They accuse the Pope of using this technique (“promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document”), but do not use it themselves.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites supportive figures to bolster their argument, such as when they refer to an article by another writer: “See the piece by Joseph Shaw in this regard.” They also reference their own status as a signer of the “Correctio Filialis.”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between two extremes: upholding the “authentic Magisterium” and the Faith, or accepting a document that is an “outrageous proposition” that will “subvert the Church.”

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author uses dismissive phrases to shut down the opposing argument without deeper engagement, such as “Give. Me. A. Break.” The author also accuses their opponents of using one: “‘No problem here!’ has been the mantra of the neo-Catholic establishment.”

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the topic of Cardinal Burke’s reappointment to a minor post, which distracts from the central argument about the document’s translation to instead attack the Pope’s character as a “cunning ecclesiastical politician.”

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes a simplified version of his opponents’ argument, stating they claim “All of the critics of AL are wrong—every one of them!” and then proceeds to attack this oversimplified position rather than the nuances of their linguistic argument.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – When discussing the idea that expecting continence is Pharisaical, the author deflects by charging the other side with a form of hypocrisy: “Then again, the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law.”

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform or engage in a balanced theological debate, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint by employing a vast arsenal of rhetorical and manipulative techniques. The piece systematically uses name-calling, loaded language, and appeals to fear to demonize Pope Francis and his supporters, framing them as malicious conspirators with a “master plan to subvert the Church.” It creates straw man arguments of its opponents’ positions to make them seem foolish and easily refutable. It simplifies complex theological and political issues into a black-and-white struggle between good (“defenders of the authentic Magisterium”) and evil (a “cunning ecclesiastical politician”). The sheer density and variety of propaganda techniques—from Red Herring to Causal Oversimplification to a form of Reduction ad Hitlerum—show a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions rather than engage their intellect in a fair-minded way. The lack of charitable interpretation, coupled with the constant use of sarcasm and dismissive slogans, solidifies its status as a highly effective piece of propaganda.
