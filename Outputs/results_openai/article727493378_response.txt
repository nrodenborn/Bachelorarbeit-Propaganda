Verdict – 40% – The text contains elements of propaganda, particularly through the use of doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, and appeal to authority. These techniques are used to question the credibility of the coroner's actions and to create a sense of urgency and suspicion. However, it does not heavily rely on a wide range of propaganda techniques, and the presence of factual reporting and quotes from credible sources provides some balance. Therefore, while there are propaganda elements, the text is not overwhelmingly propagandistic.
