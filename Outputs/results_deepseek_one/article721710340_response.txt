2. **Repetition** – No – Key phrases like "criminal aliens" or "previously deported" are repeated for factual emphasis, not as a rhetorical device.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, rallying phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL") appear; the text is expository.

5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility (e.g., "Can we trust this administration?").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Criminal histories are factually listed (e.g., "sexual assault," "kidnapping"); no apparent inflation/downplaying.

### Verdict – 35% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is primarily a factual report detailing ICE arrests, including specific data (e.g., locations, crimes, legal statuses). However, it contains **subtle propagandistic framing** through:  
- **Loaded language** ("criminal aliens," "reckless sanctuary policies") that stigmatizes targets and policies.  
- **Appeal to fear** by linking non-cooperation with law enforcement to community risk.  
These elements serve ICE’s institutional agenda to justify enforcement actions and critique sanctuary policies. Yet, the bulk of the text avoids overt emotional manipulation, hyperbole, or logical fallacies. The propaganda is confined to the quoted official statement and terminology choices, not the entire report. Thus, while not purely objective, it leans more toward biased reporting than systematic propaganda.
