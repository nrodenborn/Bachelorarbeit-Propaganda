1. Name calling – No – The text reports on Paul Manafort calling a story “deliberately libelous,” but the article itself does not use insulting labels to attack any subject.
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat the same message over and over to influence the reader. It presents a claim and the responses to it in a structured manner.
3. Slogans – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used in the text.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text explains the potential implications of the report ("suggest a direct connection between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, which released tens of thousands of emails stolen by Russian spies"), but it does so to establish newsworthiness, not to instill fear as a primary persuasive tool.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text inherently casts doubt on the credibility of the Guardian's report by immediately highlighting that the accused parties "denounced the report as false" and by stating that the newspaper "did not identify the sources for its reporting."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text itself does not exaggerate or minimize. It does, however, quote an exaggerated statement from WikiLeaks ("willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor’s head"), but this is reporting on a statement, not a technique used by the author.
7. Flag-Waving – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or national identity in the text.
8. Loaded Language – No – The language is generally neutral and journalistic. Words like "secretly" or "stolen" are used to describe the allegations and context, not to evoke an emotional response from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – There are no comparisons to hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular and should be accepted for that reason. It highlights a controversy with two clear opposing sides.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not propose a simple cause for a complex event. It reports on a single alleged event and its context.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is clear and direct. It even points out where information is missing ("There was no detail on what might have been discussed"), which is the opposite of intentional vagueness.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text cites sources (The Guardian, AP, lawyers), which is standard journalistic practice for attribution, not a fallacious appeal to authority to prove a point.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present only two options. It presents a claim, denials, and the context, allowing the reader to assess the complex situation.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases designed to stop critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – All information presented, such as the timeline of Manafort's hiring and the Russian hacking, is relevant to the context of the central allegation.
17. Straw men – No – The text presents direct refutations of the actual argument made by the Guardian, not a distorted version of it.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge anyone with hypocrisy to deflect from the issue.

Verdict – 5% – This text is an example of standard journalistic reporting, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the audience about a claim made by one news outlet (The Guardian) and the strong denials from the subjects of that claim (Manafort and Assange). The article maintains a neutral tone, carefully attributes all information to its respective source, and presents both sides of the issue. It includes direct quotes from the denials, giving them significant weight. Furthermore, it practices journalistic transparency by pointing out the weakness in the Guardian's report, namely the use of unidentified sources. The only technique present, "Doubt," is a natural outcome of balanced reporting on a controversial and unconfirmed story, rather than a tool for manipulation. Propaganda would likely present the allegation as fact, omit or downplay the denials, and use loaded language to persuade the reader. This text does the opposite.
