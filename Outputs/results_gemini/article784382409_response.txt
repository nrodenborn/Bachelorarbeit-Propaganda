Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Keith Ellison as a “frightened puppy” and a “Communist-backed, Muslim, accused woman abuser.”

Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?” is repeated three times consecutively.

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the form of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear by asking, “Will the people not demand justice and vote a Communist-backed, Muslim, accused woman abuser into the office of prosecuting criminals?”

Doubt – Yes – The text questions Keith Ellison’s credibility by stating he “doesn't have an active license to practice law” while running for attorney general and by highlighting his refusal to answer questions.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates Ellison’s actions by describing him as trying to “flee like a frightened puppy.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific group identity by framing the election as a choice for “the people” to “demand justice” against a perceived threat to their values.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases such as “Hounds,” “frightened puppy,” and “demonic teachings of Muhammad in the Koran.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler specifically, the text uses the same technique by disapproving of Ellison by associating him with groups the intended audience is likely to hate, such as “Communist-backed” and followers of the “demonic teachings of Muhammad in the Koran.”

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular; rather, it frames itself as standing against the mainstream or a political party.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple and singular cause for Ellison’s alleged behavior: “he can more than likely justify his actions based upon the demonic teachings of Muhammad in the Koran.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague or obscure; its accusations and language are direct and inflammatory.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites “investigative journalist Laura Loomer,” police reports, and CBS News as authorities to lend credibility to its claims.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The final paragraph presents a false dichotomy: either the people of Minnesota vote for an evil man or they “demand justice,” ignoring any other possibilities or nuances.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “Democrats cover for their own” is used as a simple, dismissive explanation to shut down any nuanced discussion about why some people might still support Ellison.

Red herring – Yes – The text includes a poll, “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?”, which is completely unrelated to the article’s subject matter about Keith Ellison.

Straw men – Yes – The text anticipates and refutes a potential counter-argument by stating, “Even one woman in the Loomer video says, why are they waiting till now to bring this forward? Well, for Ms. Monahan, perhaps that could be asked, but not for Amy Alexander.” This addresses a simplified version of a potential defense.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text directly accuses Democrats of hypocrisy: “What's amazing is that Democrats cover for their own, ignoring the obvious hypocrisy they demonstrate when they opponents are accused of such things.”

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt an extremely negative view of Keith Ellison by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. While it presents factual elements (the existence of allegations and news reports), it frames them with highly biased and emotionally manipulative language. The use of Name Calling (“frightened puppy”), Loaded Language (“demonic teachings”), and Appeal to Fear (the final question about electing a “Communist-backed, Muslim, accused woman abuser”) is pervasive. Furthermore, it employs logical fallacies like Causal Oversimplification by linking the allegations to his religion, and Whataboutism to attack the Democratic party. An objective news report would present the allegations, include Ellison's denials, and avoid the inflammatory, speculative, and derogatory language that defines this piece. The presence of 15 out of the 18 listed techniques confirms its nature as a work of propaganda.
