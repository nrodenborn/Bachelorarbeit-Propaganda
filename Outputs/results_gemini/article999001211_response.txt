1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Jim Acosta's behavior as acting 'like a child' and calls the judge's ruling 'frivolous' and 'ridiculous'.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question 'Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?' is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases that are repeated to encapsulate an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – No – While the text mentions a 'dangerous a precedent,' its primary emotional appeal is to anger and indignation, not fear.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the judge by stating he 'should be impeached over his frivolous ruling' and that he 'should know better'.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the severity of the situation by suggesting a judge should be 'impeached' for a ruling on a press pass.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific political identity by starting with 'For any constitutionalist...' and later criticizing officials for how little they 'know of our Constitution'.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like 'surreal', 'frivolous ruling', 'ridiculous demand', and 'unconstitutional rulings' to influence the reader's opinion.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to a group widely hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not claim its viewpoint is popular to persuade the reader; rather, it argues against a decision made by the White House.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex legal and constitutional issues of press freedom and due process down to a simple matter of Jim Acosta's lack of 'simple human decency'.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's opinion is stated very clearly and directly; there is no attempt to be vague.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does not cite an authority to support its claim; in fact, it attacks the authority of the judge.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents a false choice between 'Yes, he should have gotten it back' and 'No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass', framing the issue as a simple choice between supporting Acosta or supporting good behavior, ignoring all nuance.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The poll answer 'No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass' is a simplistic, dismissive phrase that discourages deeper consideration of the legal and constitutional principles involved.
16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on the topic of Jim Acosta and the White House press rules without introducing irrelevant material to distract.
17. Straw men – No – The text attacks the actual ruling and actions taken, not a misrepresentation of them.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy on an unrelated issue.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. It is not an objective news report but an opinion piece that uses numerous propaganda techniques to persuade the reader to adopt its viewpoint. The piece employs name-calling ('frivolous', 'like a child'), loaded language, and exaggeration to create an emotional, negative impression of the judge and Jim Acosta. It uses flag-waving by appealing to 'constitutionalists' to create an in-group and frames the issue with a black & white fallacy in the poll. The use of repetition for the poll question is designed to drill the biased framing into the reader's mind. The entire purpose of the text is not to inform but to inflame opinion and solidify a specific, one-sided perspective by manipulating the reader's emotions and bypassing critical, nuanced thought.
