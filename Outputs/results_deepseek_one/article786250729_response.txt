**Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation**  
The text is highly likely propaganda due to:  
1. **Selective framing**: Focuses exclusively on alleged Google-Clinton "collusion" while dismissing established election interference facts.  
2. **Emotional manipulation**: Uses loaded language ("colluded," "disgraced") and name-calling to provoke outrage.  
3. **Source bias**: Relies solely on conservative-aligned sources (Fox News, Trump tweet) and WikiLeaks without neutral verification.  
4. **Distraction tactics**: Introduces a red herring (Strzok scandal) to divert from weak evidence for core claims.  
5. **Exaggeration/Minimization**: Downplays Russian interference impact while amplifying unproven claims about Google.  
6. **Doubt cultivation**: Undermines institutional credibility (DOJ, FBI, "establishment") to support conspiracy narratives.  

Though it cites specific emails/quotes, their presentation lacks context and balances accusatory language with insinuations of illegality. The text’s goal is clearly to persuade readers of a partisan narrative rather than objectively inform, warranting a high propaganda likelihood. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the existence of cited sources (emails, tweets), even if their interpretation is skewed.
