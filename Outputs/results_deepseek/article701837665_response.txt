Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Displaying their naivete" (insulting mainstream commentators) and "ludicrous notion" (mocking the CIA's justification).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated use of "regime-change operation" (e.g., "U.S. national-security regime-change operation") and "Art of the Deal" (referencing Trump 4 times).  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans; descriptive language dominates.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "United States would fall into the ocean" (hyperbolic threat if records are released) and "grave threat to national security" (implying dire consequences).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "the official story is filled with holes" and "Why would a genuine communist join the Marines?" (questioning official narratives).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "mosaic of a U.S. national-security regime-change operation" (framing JFK killing as orchestrated coup). Minimization: "Oswald, who had absolutely no motive" (dismissing alternative theories).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity; critiques U.S. institutions instead.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "cover-up," "patsy," "skewers them," "blissfully skate" (emotionally charged terms framing CIA/Trump as deceitful).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity; positions itself as contrarian.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Asserts JFK assassination was solely a CIA "regime-change operation" while ignoring complex historical factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct; no deliberate confusion.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites Douglas Horne (ex-Assassination Records Review Board) to validate claims: "read FFF’s ebook JFK’s War... by Douglas Horne."  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents only two options: CIA conspiracy or illogical "lone nut" theory (e.g., "requires a suspension of logic").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "case closed" that halt discussion; invites critical analysis.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Shifts to Russia investigation: "my hunch is that it pertains to Russia... congressional investigations... are about to fizzle out" (irrelevant to JFK records).  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents "communist Marine" argument: "How many communist Marines have you ever heard of?" (simplifying/discrediting official stance).  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Compares Oswald's treatment to Assange/Snowden: "Think about Martin Luther King, John Walker Lindh, Edward Snowden... Why... let Lee Harvey Oswald... skate blissfully?"

**Verdict – 95%** – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 12 distinct propaganda techniques to advance a conspiracy narrative about the JFK assassination and CIA-Trump collusion. Key indicators include:  
- **Selective Evidence**: Dismisses official accounts while presenting speculative claims (e.g., CIA-Russia deal) as near-certainty ("virtual certainly," "my hunch").  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language ("cover-up," "patsy") and fear appeals ("fall into the ocean") override factual analysis.  
- **False Dilemmas**: Reduces the assassination to a binary choice between a CIA plot or an illogical "lone nut" theory.  
- **Source Bias**: Relies on self-referential articles and politicized authors (e.g., Jacob Hornberger) while deriding mainstream media.  
- **Distraction Tactics**: Uses whataboutism (Snowden/Assange) and red herrings (Russia investigation) to evade scrutiny.  
Though it references real events (e.g., Trump’s document delay), the text’s primary goal is persuasion through distortion, not balanced inquiry. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges minor factual anchors (e.g., tweet quotes), but these are weaponized to serve the propaganda.
