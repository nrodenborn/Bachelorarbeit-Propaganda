Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the term "illegals" to refer to undocumented immigrants, which is a label intended to be insulting and dehumanizing. Example: "Illegals Have To Go!"

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief and memorable phrases to summarize complex ideas. Example: “A nice simple system that works.”

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that the alternative to the proposed plan is a dangerous one. Example: “The Democrats want open borders and they don’t care about crime.”

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of a news source and the motives of political opponents. Example: "...blasting the New York Times report that said he didn't really want to sign his executive order..."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the complexity of the proposed solution by calling it a “nice simple system” and exaggerates the negative aspects of the current system by calling it a “worthless judicial process.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue in terms of protecting "the American people" and "America's tax dollars."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses words with strong emotional connotations to influence the audience. Examples include “illegals,” “ripped,” and “blasting.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that the reader should adopt an idea because it is already popular with the majority.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a complex issue (immigration) as having a simple cause (bad laws) and a simple solution. Example: "Trump then called on Congress to correct the problems created by legislation with more legislation."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The proposed “simple immigration plan” is not detailed, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks. The phrase “they have to go out” is deliberately vague about the actual process.

Appeal to authority – No – While the text quotes the President, an authority figure, it is presenting his proposal rather than using his or another authority's testimony as evidence to support a separate claim.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two extreme choices regarding immigration policy. Example: “We want strong borders and we want no crime. The Democrats want open borders and they don’t care about crime.”

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that present a conclusion as obvious and discourages further thought. Example: "It is time that Congress sure up things..."

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll asking, “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” This is completely irrelevant to the topic of the immigration plan and serves to distract and attack political opponents.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the opposing viewpoint to make it easier to attack. Example: “The Democrats want open borders and they don’t care about crime.”

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing the opponent of hypocrisy on a different issue.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific political viewpoint by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. The article uses loaded language ("illegals," "ripped") and name-calling to create a negative emotional response. It employs logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy and a straw man argument to create a false dichotomy between Trump's "simple" plan and a fabricated, dangerous alternative attributed to Democrats ("open borders and they don’t care about crime"). Furthermore, the inclusion of a completely irrelevant and repeated poll about "corrupt" Democrats serves as a blatant red herring to distract and poison the well against political opponents. The combination of emotional manipulation, logical fallacies, and distracting content, all framed to support one political side while aggressively attacking the other, moves this piece far from objective reporting and firmly into the category of propaganda.
