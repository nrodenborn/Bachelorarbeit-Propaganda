Verdict – 80% – The text exhibits many characteristics of propaganda, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, red herring, and straw men. These techniques are used to shape the reader's perception of the Kavanaugh nomination process, portraying it as a battle between good (Kavanaugh and the Republicans) and evil (the Democrats), which is a hallmark of propaganda. The presence of these techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is intended to influence public opinion in a biased manner.
