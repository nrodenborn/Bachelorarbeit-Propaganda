1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Christine Ford a "radical political activist" and accuses her of promoting "baby murder." It also suggests she has "mental issues."
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes that Ford provided her testimony "without any evidence at all" and that the attack was a "political hit." The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is also repeated three times.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses on generating anger and indignation about the events surrounding the hearing, rather than instilling fear in the audience about a future negative outcome.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is designed to cast doubt on Christine Ford's credibility and motives. For example, it states, "her story didn't exactly lend credibility except with Democrat members" and questions her actions: "but did she go to local law enforcement? Nope."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates Ford's political views by labeling her a "radical political activist who promotes baby murder." It also minimizes her testimony by repeatedly stating she had "absolutely no evidence."
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its case.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as "political hit," "ruining his good name," "radical political activist," and "baby murder," all designed to evoke strong emotional reactions rather than rational judgment.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The article does not suggest the reader should agree with an idea because it is popular. In fact, the author frames their position as a brave, minority viewpoint.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the entire complex controversy surrounding Ford's testimony to a single, simple cause: a "political hit" orchestrated by Democrats. Example: "that attack on him was orchestrated, it was political and Ford was a part of it."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and makes its accusations very clearly. It does not use vague or confusing language.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text directs the reader to another source as evidence, stating, "For a quick run down of the political hit on Kavanaugh, take a look at this short synopsis by Paul Joseph Watson." It also cites Kavanaugh's own defense as evidence: "Kavanaugh even responded by pointing out that even her friends said they don't recall such an incident".
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two possibilities: either Ford is a genuine victim or she was a willing participant in a "political hit." It dismisses any nuance or alternative explanations. The author states, "Of course, she was part of it!" leaving no room for other interpretations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases or clichés designed to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a completely irrelevant poll in the middle of the article: "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" This serves no purpose other than to distract the reader and collect user data. It also brings up an unrelated accusation against a Democratic senator to distract from the topic at hand.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a caricature of Christine Ford rather than her actual position. It labels her a "radical political activist who promotes baby murder," an extreme characterization designed to be easily dismissed, rather than addressing the specifics of her testimony or stated motivations.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text attempts to discredit the hearing by charging a member of the opposition with hypocrisy: "...except with Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of which has openly professed to sexual assault." This deflects from the substance of Ford's testimony by pointing to the alleged actions of someone else.

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint by employing a dense and varied array of manipulative techniques. The article systematically uses name-calling, loaded language, and exaggeration ("radical political activist," "baby murder," "mental issues") to demonize the subject, Christine Ford, and provoke an emotional response of anger and disgust from the reader. It builds its argument on a foundation of logical fallacies, most notably causal oversimplification (the entire event was just a "political hit") and a black & white fallacy that presents only two extreme options while ignoring any nuanced possibilities. The author casts doubt on Ford's motives and testimony at every turn and uses techniques like whataboutism and straw man arguments to misrepresent and discredit opposing views rather than engaging with them honestly. The inclusion of a red herring (the irrelevant poll) and an appeal to a partisan authority (Paul Joseph Watson) further cements its nature as a persuasive piece designed to reinforce a specific narrative, rather than an objective analysis of events. The sheer volume of propaganda techniques present—13 out of the 18 listed—demonstrates that manipulation, not factual reporting, is the text's core function.
