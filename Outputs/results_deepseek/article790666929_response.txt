Here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Accused Serial Woman Abuser" (in the headline), "corrupt party", "Democrat machine", "lawless party".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Different rules for the lawless party." (Brief, memorable phrase attacking Democrats).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Implied fear that Democrats (the "lawless party") operate by different, corrupt rules and will use underhanded tactics ("somehow managed to unseal", "got them unsealed anyway") to gain power, suggesting danger if they succeed.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Casts doubt on Karen Monahan's allegations by emphasizing "She has declined to show the video... She also told CNN she misplaced it."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – **Exaggeration:** Portrays the unsealing of Jack Ryan's records as a singular, nefarious act by a "corrupt party" and "Democrat machine" that single-handedly changed the election outcome. **Minimization:** Minimizes the Ellisons' right to privacy and legitimate reasons for sealing their divorce ("Our divorce simply isn’t the public’s business").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While the text implies defending against a "lawless" group, it doesn't explicitly appeal to patriotism or a specific national/group identity beyond partisan politics.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "corrupt party", "Democrat machine", "lawless party", "dirty work", "victim shaming", "probe our divorce file in search of something to use". These words/phrases carry strong negative connotations and appeal to emotion/stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – While associating Democrats with corruption ("lawless party", "Democrat machine"), it doesn't specifically link them to a group universally hated by the audience (like Nazis).
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Notes that "The Star Tribune has joined a legal effort" initiated by Alpha News, implying others are doing it so it's acceptable/necessary.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes Obama's Senate win solely to the unsealing of Ryan's divorce records ("Ryan resigned. Obama took the field."), ignoring other complex factors in an election.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – "somehow managed to unseal" – The word "somehow" is vague and implies underhandedness without specifying what was improper about the legal process used in the Ryan case.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – While it cites the Star Tribune's motion and Kim Ellison's statement, it doesn't primarily use an authority figure's support *as evidence* for its core claims. It uses the Star Tribune's action more as an event in the narrative.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents Democrats as universally operating by "different rules" and being "lawless" vs. the implied lawful/ethical alternative. Also frames the Ellison situation primarily through the lens of a partisan attack ("conservative group wants to probe... in search of something to use").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Different rules for the lawless party." – This phrase shuts down nuanced discussion about the specific circumstances of either divorce record case by painting all Democrats with a broad, negative brush.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The lengthy recounting of the 2004 Obama/Ryan incident is largely irrelevant to the specific facts, legal arguments, or current allegations surrounding Keith Ellison's divorce records. It serves to distract by invoking past partisan grievance.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Reframes the Star Tribune's legal motion (based on public interest arguments regarding an AG candidate facing abuse allegations) and Kim Ellison's privacy concerns as merely a partisan attack "in search of something to use", ignoring their stated reasons.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – The entire opening section about Obama/Ryan is classic whataboutism. It deflects from the current situation (Ellison's records, abuse allegations) by charging Democrats with hypocrisy ("Different rules for the lawless party") based on a past event, implying the current action is invalid because of their alleged past behavior.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques, strongly indicating it is propaganda. Its primary purpose is not balanced reporting but to persuade the audience to view the Democrats, Keith Ellison, and the actions against him (unsealing divorce records) through a lens of inherent corruption, hypocrisy, and underhanded tactics ("lawless party," "Democrat machine," "different rules"). It achieves this by:
*   **Selective Framing:** Focusing intensely on the Obama/Ryan incident to frame the Ellison situation as a partisan attack, while downplaying the specific context of abuse allegations and public interest arguments.
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** Heavy use of loaded language, name-calling, and fear appeal to evoke anger and distrust towards Democrats/Ellison.
*   **Distortion & Distraction:** Using exaggeration, minimization, causal oversimplification, and the significant red herring of the Obama story to distort the narrative away from the specific merits of the Ellison case.
*   **Undermining Opposition:** Employing doubt, straw men, and whataboutism to discredit Karen Monahan, the Star Tribune's motives, and the Ellisons' privacy request.
*   **Discouraging Scrutiny:** Utilizing thought-terminating clichés and black-and-white fallacies to shut down nuanced discussion about the situations. While it reports factual events (the lawsuit, the allegations, Kim Ellison's statement), the framing, language, and inclusion of the largely irrelevant Obama anecdote overwhelmingly serve a persuasive, agenda-driven purpose characteristic of propaganda. The 15% allowance acknowledges the presence of some factual reporting elements within the heavily biased narrative.
