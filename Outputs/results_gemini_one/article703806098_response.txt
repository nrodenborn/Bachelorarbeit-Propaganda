1. Name calling – No – The text attacks an idea by calling the official story "complete nonsense," but it does not use an insulting label to attack a specific person or group.
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that there were multiple shooters and that there is an official cover-up is repeated throughout the text. For example, "further proof that multiple shooters were used throughout the area, a fact that directly contradicts the official story" and "authorities are actually actively covering up what really happened on that fateful night."
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as slogans to be repeated or chanted.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting a massive, dangerous cover-up by unknown authorities and highlights the suspicious death of a witness who contradicted the official story: "the person who released the information died shortly after."
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire purpose of the text is to cast doubt on the credibility of the official narrative. For example: "This stunning tower audio once again provides proof that the entire narrative that claims that Stephen Paddock operated alone from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel is complete nonsense."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggerated language to increase the impact of its claims. For example: "There Were “Active Shooters On The Runway” Bombshell Air Traffic Control Audio" and "In yet another striking example of a widespread cover-up".
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a deception against the nation. For example: "the American people are clearly not being told the truth."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader. Examples include "Bombshell," "massacre," "stunning," "fateful night," and "Shockingly."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests the idea is popular and therefore correct by citing "countless stories" and "dozens of eyewitness reports," and noting that another article on the topic went "viral."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents the air traffic control audio as simple, definitive "proof" that the entire complex official investigation is a "cover-up," ignoring any other possible interpretations or evidence.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text is deliberately vague about who is supposedly behind the conspiracy, mentioning only that "other alternative media outlets have actually named government officials and private companies that may be behind the attack" without providing specifics.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites individuals like "political strategist and co-founder of 'The New Right' Mike Tokes" and reporter "Shepard Ambellas" as authorities to lend credibility to its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: the "official story," which it calls "complete nonsense," or the conspiracy/cover-up narrative, which it presents as the truth. It leaves no room for other possibilities, such as initial confusion during a chaotic event.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that present conclusions as obvious facts to discourage further questioning. For example: "the American people are clearly not being told the truth."
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the story of Kymberley Suchomel's death. While related to the event, her death from "natural causes" is used to imply foul play, distracting from the main argument and introducing fear and suspicion.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified version of the "official story" (Paddock acted alone from the hotel) by using evidence of chaos at the airport, implying that this single contradiction invalidates the entire complex official investigation.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge any opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It is constructed not to inform, but to persuade the reader of a specific conspiracy theory by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. The article relies heavily on emotionally charged and exaggerated language (Loaded Language, Exaggeration) to create a sense of urgency and importance. It builds its case on a foundation of Doubt and a Black & White Fallacy, presenting a choice between an "official story" it labels "nonsense" and its own "truth." It uses techniques like Appeal to Fear (suspicious death of a witness), Red Herring (focusing on the death to imply a cover-up), and Bandwagon (citing "countless" other reports) to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions. The arguments are logically flawed, using Causal Oversimplification and Straw Men to attack the official narrative, while relying on vague appeals to questionable authorities. The clear intent is to bypass critical analysis and foster distrust in official institutions.
