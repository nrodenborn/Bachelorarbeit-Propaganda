Name calling – No – The text does not use any insulting labels to attack a person, group, or object.

Repetition – Yes – The idea that the storm is minor and will cause only "weak power grid fluctuations" is repeated. The phrase "weak power grid fluctuations" appears twice, and the storm is repeatedly categorized as "minor" or "G-1".

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text mentions a highly negative outcome to encourage a certain mindset. For example: "A gird failure would almost immediately fling the United States into a state of panic, and it’s always good to be prepared just in case."

Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any source; in fact, it cites credible sources like NOAA and NASA to bolster its claims.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text simultaneously minimizes the storm by calling it "minor" and "G-1," while also exaggerating the potential outcome by stating it "could still cause some havoc down on Earth."

Flag-Waving – No – While the text mentions the "United States," it does so in a geographical context for where an aurora might be visible, not as an appeal to patriotism.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the audience. For example, using words like "havoc" and "panic" to describe potential, though unlikely, outcomes.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not associate any idea with a group hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular and that the reader should adopt it for that reason.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text provides a simplified but scientifically grounded explanation for the solar flare, involving sunspots and magnetic fields, rather than attributing it to a single, overly simple cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is generally clear and provides specific details, such as the storm's classification (G-1) and its specific potential effects.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the names of official organizations as evidence for its claims. For example: "The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts..." and "As the magnetic fields in a sunspot cross, NASA stated...".

Black & white fallacy – No – The text presents a range of possibilities (a spectacular light show, weak grid fluctuations, a more serious failure) rather than just two extreme options.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a common phrase to shut down further consideration of a topic. For example: "it’s always good to be prepared just in case."

Red herring – No – All the information presented is relevant to the central topic of the solar storm.

Straw men – No – The text does not create and then refute a false argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any party of hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

***

Verdict – 20% – The text is not strong propaganda, as its primary purpose appears to be informational, and it is based on a real event reported by credible scientific agencies like NOAA and NASA. However, it employs several propaganda techniques characteristic of sensationalized journalism or "clickbait." The use of Appeal to Fear ("fling the United States into a state of panic"), Loaded Language ("havoc"), and Exaggeration ("could still cause some havoc") creates a sense of drama and urgency that is not fully supported by the facts it presents (a "minor" G-1 storm). The inclusion of a Thought-terminating cliché ("it’s always good to be prepared") serves to reinforce this mild alarmism. These techniques are likely used not for a political or ideological agenda, but for the commercial purpose of making the story more engaging and increasing readership. Therefore, while it contains propagandistic elements, its core is factual, making it a low-level example of propaganda.
