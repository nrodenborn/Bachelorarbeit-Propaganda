Below is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the provided text, followed by a verdict on whether the text constitutes propaganda. Examples are quoted directly from the text where applicable.

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – Explanation: Insults directed at Pope Francis (e.g., "the most dangerous pontificate in history," acting as a "substitute of our Lord"). Positive labels for Viganò (e.g., "the most courageous prelate," "a modern-day Athanasius").  
2. **Repetition** – No – Explanation: No single phrase or idea is repeated obsessively; arguments are developed thematically.  
3. **Slogans** – No – Explanation: No brief, catchy phrases designed for memorability (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL" is absent).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Explanation: Warns of existential threats (e.g., "forces of hell," "fighting for the very survival of the human element of the Catholic Church," "enemy ... has now made their way to the thrones of power").  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Explanation: Questions Pope Francis’s credibility (e.g., "How can one avoid concluding that the reason they do not provide the documentation is that they know it confirms my testimony?").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Explanation: Exaggerates Viganò’s role (e.g., "standing against corrupt men," "forces of hell") and minimizes counter-evidence (e.g., framing Francis’s silence as guilt: "Qui tacet consentit").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Explanation: Appeals to Catholic identity and duty (e.g., "for the sake of Holy Mother Church herself," "brothers and sisters in Christ").  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Explanation: Emotionally charged terms (e.g., "corrupt men," "bombshell," "passion," "forces of hell," "grave harm").  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis, fascists, or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Explanation: No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone supports this"); instead, Viganò is portrayed as isolated ("standing alone").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Explanation: Attributes problems to systemic corruption but acknowledges complexity (e.g., multiple cases of cover-ups).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Explanation: Specific accusations are detailed (e.g., McCarrick’s sanctions, documented cases).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Explanation: Cites Scripture (e.g., Psalm 103, 2 Timothy), saints (Athanasius), and Cardinal Ouellet’s alleged knowledge (e.g., "You have at your complete disposal key documents").  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Explanation: Presents a binary: Viganò/truth vs. Francis/corruption (e.g., "corrupt men" vs. "honest man," "silence" as guilt).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – Explanation: No phrases like "it is what it is"; instead, invites scrutiny (e.g., "Read the Archbishop’s words for yourselves").  
16. **Red herring** – No – Explanation: Focuses consistently on abuse cover-ups; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Explanation: Accusations against Francis are direct (e.g., protecting McCarrick), not misrepresented.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Explanation: Does not deflect criticism by accusing others of hypocrisy; focuses solely on Francis’s actions.  

### Verdict  
**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs **name-calling** (demonizing Francis, sanctifying Viganò), **appeal to fear** (hell, Church survival), **doubt** (undermining Francis’s credibility), **exaggeration** (apocalyptic stakes), **loaded language** (emotional manipulation), **black-and-white framing** (good vs. evil), and **appeals to authority** (Scripture, clergy). While it references factual events (e.g., McCarrick scandal), its primary goal is not impartial analysis but to galvanize support for Viganò and condemn Francis through emotionally charged, morally absolutist rhetoric. The lack of counter-perspectives and reliance on dramatic dichotomies ("forces of hell," "most dangerous pontificate") confirm its propagandistic intent. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges the underlying factual basis of abuse cover-up allegations, though these are weaponized for persuasion.
