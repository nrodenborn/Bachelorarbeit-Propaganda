### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of emotional manipulation, one-sided framing, and numerous propaganda techniques. It presents Assange exclusively as a victim of a coordinated, malicious campaign while dismissing all allegations against him (e.g., Swedish case as "bogus"). Facts are selectively curated to evoke outrage (e.g., Clinton’s Libya actions, media hypocrisy), and opposing viewpoints are ignored or smeared ("Vichy journalists"). Loaded language ("persecution," "torture," "witch-hunt") and fear appeals ("end in tragedy") dominate, aiming to galvanize support rather than encourage critical analysis. While based on real events, the text omits counter-evidence (e.g., legal complexities of extradition) and reduces issues to simplistic binaries (silence vs. justice). Its reliance on authority figures, repetition, and thought-terminating clichés further suppresses nuance. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges limited factual references (e.g., Snowden leaks), but these are embedded in a manipulative narrative. Overall, the text prioritizes persuasion over balanced reporting, aligning with propaganda’s core function: to shape perception through emotive, partisan rhetoric.
