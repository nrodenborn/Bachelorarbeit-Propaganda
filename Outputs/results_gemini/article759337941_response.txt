1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Democrats as “criminal, treasonous and sleazy” and refers to an IT aide as a “jihadi.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the phrase “jihad-treason” to create a brief, memorable, and impactful label for the alleged actions.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text aims to instill fear by stating that Democrats “gave this jihadi unfettered access to national security secrets” which were then transferred to a foreign country, implying a grave danger to the nation.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text opens by questioning the official narrative with “Accidentally? Color me skeptical,” immediately casting doubt on the credibility of the Capitol Police's actions.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the scope of the issue by calling it “the biggest story of treason and espionage in the recent memory.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue around “national security secrets” and “treason,” urging the reader to be concerned for their country's safety.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like “jihadi,” “treasonous,” “sleazy,” “hellbent,” and “nefarious” to provoke a strong emotional response rather than a rational one.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of the Democrats' actions by claiming they “toil in Soviet fictions,” associating them with a widely hated totalitarian regime.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The inclusion of a poll (“take our poll”) encourages the reader to join in with what is presented as a popular opinion or movement against Democrats.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces a complex legal and political situation to a simple cause: “The Democrat leadership collusion with Muslim spies.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague; its purpose is to make very direct and clear accusations, even if they are unsubstantiated.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the “House IG,” “House investigators,” and an article by “Luke Rosiak” from “The Daily Caller News Foundation” to lend an appearance of credibility to its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a simple choice: either you believe the Democrats are engaged in a massive treasonous cover-up, or you are being fooled by the media, leaving no room for other explanations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “jihad-treason” functions as a thought-terminating cliché by applying a powerful, damning label that discourages any nuanced discussion of the actual allegations.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces an irrelevant distraction by stating, “Hellbent to destroy President Trump, they toil in Soviet fictions and titillating porn stories,” shifting the focus away from the Awan case to other political grievances.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text sets up the simplified argument that the evidence was given away “Accidentally” and then attacks this weak premise (“Accidentally? Color me skeptical”) rather than engaging with any complex official explanation.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text primarily focuses on attacking Democrats and does not deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy in the typical "what about..." format.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. It employs an overwhelming majority (16 out of 18) of the listed techniques to achieve its goal. The piece is not intended to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, extremely negative viewpoint of the Democratic party. It does this by using highly emotional and loaded language (jihadi, treasonous, sleazy), name-calling, and appeals to fear concerning national security. It constructs a simplified narrative of good versus evil using a black & white fallacy and causal oversimplification, while distracting from the core topic with red herrings. The text attempts to build its own credibility through appeals to authority while simultaneously casting doubt on official sources and the media. The entire structure, from the inflammatory headline to the repetitive poll and the embedded article, is designed to stoke anger and reinforce a biased conclusion, leaving no room for critical thought or alternative perspectives.
