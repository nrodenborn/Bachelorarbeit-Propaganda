1. Name calling – Yes – The author describes the FBI as having “deep, deep corruption” and calls their investigation a “comic opera.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the motive is a “mystery” is repeated sarcastically throughout the text to emphasize the author’s point that the motive is obvious (e.g., “Motive a mystery,” “indeed a real mystery,” “a complete mystery”).

3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase “global jihad” is used as a brief and simple explanation for complex events.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text ends with a graphic and fear-inducing hypothetical: “…will agents there be struggling to determine the jihadis’ motive even as the machete begins to slice through their necks?”

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire piece is designed to cast doubt on the FBI’s competence and credibility, as stated in the line: “And that in a nutshell shows what’s wrong with today’s FBI.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the FBI’s stated uncertainty, calling it “deep, deep corruption” and “willful ignorance,” while minimizing any other potential motive, such as mental illness.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national security by focusing on the target being a “U.S. Air Force Base” and framing the event as part of a “war” against the U.S. in which “military personnel” are targets.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “willful ignorance,” “comic opera,” and “deep, deep corruption” to create a negative impression of the FBI.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The author disapproves of the FBI’s investigation by comparing it to a hypothetical failure to understand the motives of the German Army during the Battle of the Bulge or the Nazi invasion of Poland.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea. Instead, it presents its view as a truth that is being ignored by mainstream authorities.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author insists that the single, simple cause for the complex event is the “global jihad” and dismisses any other potential factors, such as mental health, as an absurd refusal to see the truth.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s position is stated very clearly and directly. He accuses the FBI of being vague, but his own writing is not.

13. Appeal to authority – No – The text actively attacks and undermines the authority of the FBI rather than using it as support for its claims.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either the motive is Islamic jihad, or the FBI is corrupt and willfully ignorant. It does not allow for the possibility of a careful, multi-faceted investigation.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author uses the phrase “the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the living room” to imply the answer is so obvious that any further discussion or critical thought is foolish.

16. Red herring – Yes – The lengthy and dramatic comparisons to Nazi Germany and the Battle of the Bulge are irrelevant to the facts of the specific case and serve to distract the reader by introducing a frightening historical parallel.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an argument that the FBI did not make. He lists specific evidence the FBI would supposedly need (“an ISIS membership card,” a note saying “I did this for Allah”) and then criticizes them, even though the FBI agent simply stated they had not found a “nexus of terrorism” at that point.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text accuses the FBI of incompetence and ignorance but does not attempt to deflect criticism from the author or his position by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform the reader about an event, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint through manipulative means. The piece employs an overwhelming number of propaganda techniques (14 out of the 18 listed) to achieve this goal.

Instead of presenting a balanced analysis, the author begins with a conclusion—that the motive was Islamic jihad and the FBI is corrupt for not stating so—and works backward, selecting and framing information to fit that narrative. It uses loaded language, name-calling, and sarcasm to attack the credibility of the official source (the FBI). It employs powerful logical fallacies like causal oversimplification (insisting on one simple cause), the black & white fallacy (it's either jihad or FBI corruption), and straw men (misrepresenting the FBI's position to make it easier to attack).

Furthermore, the text heavily relies on emotional manipulation through techniques like appeal to fear, with its graphic closing image, and reduction ad Hitlerum, which links the FBI's caution to ignoring the Nazi threat. The goal is to bypass the reader's critical thinking and provoke an emotional, fear-based agreement with the author's position. The sheer density and combination of these techniques confirm that the text is not a piece of objective journalism or commentary, but a deliberate work of propaganda.
