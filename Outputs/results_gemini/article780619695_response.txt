Here are the propaganda techniques identified in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Pope Francis and his allies as “Synodal Schemers.”
2.  Repetition – Yes – The phrase “How inconvenient that” is repeated six times in a row to emphasize a series of points the author finds damning.
3.  Slogans – Yes – The text uses the hashtag “#StopTheSynod2018” as a rallying cry and call to action.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that inviting young people to the Synod “poses serious moral and physical dangers to these unsuspecting youth” from “predatory clerics.”
5.  Doubt – Yes – The text questions Cardinal Farrell's credibility by repeatedly stating he “roomed with the notorious Cardinal Theodore McCarrick for six years and never knew anything about McCarrick’s predatory behavior.”
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by calling the Synod the “doctrinal culmination of the ‘Who Am I to Judge’ mantra.” It minimizes the stated purpose of the Synod by framing it solely as a ploy to change doctrine on homosexuality.
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific traditionalist Catholic identity by framing the conflict as a battle for the “soul of the Catholic Church” against those who would relax its teachings, urging the “laity” to take action to protect the Church.
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases such as “Synodal Schemers,” “backdoor tactics,” “machinations,” “predatory clerics,” and “sordid lifestyle.”
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses the same logic by disapproving of the Synod by linking its agenda to a “homosexual network of clergy and prelates” which it portrays as a universally hated group of “predators and coverup enablers.”
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The end of the text calls on the reader to “Please sign and encourage your friends, contacts, and social media associates to do the same,” creating the impression of a growing movement that the reader should join.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text states that “the underlying cause of the criminal scandal lies in the homosexual network of priests, bishops and cardinals,” reducing the complex issue of clergy abuse to a single, simple cause.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and explicit in its accusations and goals. It is not vague or intentionally confusing.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites “Edward Pentin , Henry Sire, George Neumayr and an array of investigative journalists” as having “brilliantly documented” the alleged manipulations. It also identifies the author as an attorney who has investigated sex abuse, lending her professional authority to the argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either cancel the Synod and pursue criminal investigations, or allow the Synod to proceed and cause “moral and physical exploitation of the youth.” It ignores any possibility of a middle ground or that the Synod could have positive outcomes.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – While the text critiques the phrase “Who Am I to Judge,” it does not use such clichés itself to shut down discussion. Its goal is to provoke, not terminate, a specific line of thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text repeatedly brings up the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report and the McCarrick scandal to distract from the stated pastoral purpose of the Synod on Youth, reframing the entire event as being solely about a homosexual predation scandal.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a distorted version of the Synod's purpose, claiming it aims to “embrace the ‘LGBT’ lifestyle” and “minimize that nagging and unmerciful Catholic catechism doctrine.” This is an exaggeration of the nuanced language quoted from the working document, making the Synod's position easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text repeatedly charges the Church with hypocrisy, for example: “How inconvenient that during a global prelate homosexual coverup scandal, the 2018 Synodal Bishop Conferences are exploring for ways during the Synod to discuss ways in which homosexual youths want to be ‘closer’ to the Church!”

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform in a balanced way, but to persuade the reader to adopt a highly negative and specific viewpoint and to take a specific action (signing a petition to stop the Synod). The piece employs a vast arsenal of propaganda techniques (16 out of the 18 listed) to achieve this goal.

The argument is built on a foundation of emotional manipulation (Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language), logical fallacies (Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy, Straw Men), and attacks on the character and credibility of its subjects (Name Calling, Doubt, Whataboutism). It simplifies a complex situation—a synod on youth pastoral care happening amidst a clergy abuse crisis—into a single, sinister plot (Causal Oversimplification). It creates a clear enemy ("Synodal Schemers," a "homosexual network") and appeals to the reader's identity as a concerned Catholic (Flag-Waving) to join a growing movement (Bandwagon) against this enemy. The constant repetition and use of slogans reinforce its core message, leaving little room for critical thought or alternative interpretations. The sheer density and combination of these techniques confirm the text's nature as a persuasive, emotionally-driven piece of propaganda rather than a factual, objective analysis.
