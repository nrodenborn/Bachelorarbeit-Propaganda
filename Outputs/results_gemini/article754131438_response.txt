Verdict – 0% – This text is a factual news report, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the public about a public health emergency, not to persuade the audience towards a specific ideology or action beyond general public health awareness. While one technique, "Appeal to authority," is present, it is used in a standard journalistic manner to cite credible sources (the World Health Organization, the DRC government) and lend factual weight to the report. This is the opposite of propaganda, which often uses appeals to authority fallaciously to bypass evidence. The language is neutral and informative, and it lacks the manipulative and emotional intent characteristic of propaganda.
