Verdict – 80% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, red herring, and whataboutism. These techniques are used to create a narrative that questions the fairness of the justice system and portrays Saucier as a victim of political bias, while simultaneously attacking Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration. The presence of these techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is propaganda.
