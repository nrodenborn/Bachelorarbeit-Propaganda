Name calling – Yes – The text attacks the concept of "national security" by calling it "the two most important and meaningless words in the American political lexicon."

Repetition – Yes – The idea that the CIA is engaged in a "cover-up" and seeking "continued secrecy" for its records is repeated multiple times throughout the text.

Slogans – No – The text does not employ brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate its message.

Appeal to fear – No – The text argues a conspiracy has already occurred rather than instilling fear of a future event or alternative course of action.

Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the credibility of the CIA, its motives for secrecy, and the official narrative of the JFK assassination. For example: "National security? Really?"

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the official reason for secrecy, calling the "national security" argument "ludicrous," and exaggerates the certainty of its own conclusions, stating, "Make no mistake about it: A deal is about to be made."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of civic duty and patriotism by stating, "Every American owes it to himself to read that manual" and framing the issue as something the "American people" are being deceived about.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as "desperately," "ludicrous," "pat frame-up," and "ridiculous claim."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text links the CIA’s alleged methods to those of hated groups, stating that blaming a communist was "the advice that the Pentagon and the CIA were doling out to Latin American military dictatorships at the School of the Americas."

Bandwagon – No – The text argues against the mainstream/popular opinion, positioning itself as a contrarian viewpoint rather than suggesting its ideas are popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex political situation surrounding the JFK files into a simple transaction: "What is going on here? Negotiations. The art of the deal."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – While the author’s conclusion is clear, the evidence is vague. He refers to "small bits of important circumstantial evidence that fill out even further the mosaic" without specifying what that evidence is.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites the accused, Lee Harvey Oswald, as an authority on his own innocence ("Don’t forget, after all, that that’s what Oswald said. He said he was being framed."). He also cites his own previous work as evidence.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between two extremes: either the official "lone nut" story, which it dismisses, or the author's specific theory of a CIA-led conspiracy. "Let’s proceed from the opposite assumption: That the CIA... orchestrated the assassination..."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like "Make no mistake about it" to shut down questioning and present a speculative conclusion as an established fact.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces other historical CIA operations (Iran, Guatemala, Chile, etc.) to establish a pattern of behavior, which distracts from the lack of direct evidence presented for the specific claim about the JFK assassination.

Straw men – Yes – The author constructs a simplified and easily refutable version of the official story, describing it as: "the assassination was committed by a lone nut former U.S. Marine communist, one who had no motive to kill the president."

Whataboutism – No – The text makes direct accusations against the CIA and the media but does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly controversial viewpoint by employing a wide array of manipulative rhetorical techniques. The author systematically uses loaded language, casts doubt on official institutions, and creates a straw man version of the mainstream narrative to make it appear foolish. The argument relies on a black-and-white fallacy, presenting a choice between a "ludicrous" official story and the author's conspiracy theory. It uses causal oversimplification to explain complex political maneuvering as a simple "deal" and presents speculation as fact with thought-terminating phrases like "Make no mistake about it." Rather than presenting concrete evidence for its central claim, it uses red herrings (other CIA operations) to build a general sense of distrust. The sheer number and blatant use of these techniques indicate a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and bypass critical analysis, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
