Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "rogue nation" (referring to Iran) is an insulting label used to attack the subject.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: While the core allegation is repeated (Obama secretly aiding Iran's access), it's presented as a developing narrative with details, not the exact same phrase hammered home incessantly.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable, rallying cry-like phrases (e.g., "Build the Wall!") are used.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text highlights warnings about Iran channeling money to terrorists ("Quds Force... terrorist organization") and its nuclear activities ("increase its nuclear enrichment capacities," "threats... activities could be quickly expanded"), instilling fear about Iran and implicitly supporting the actions taken against it (like Trump's withdrawal/sanctions).
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Repeatedly questions the credibility of the Obama administration: "secretly paved the way," "despite... assuring lawmakers," "misleading lawmakers," "misled the American people and Congress," "desperate to get a deal."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses strong, negatively loaded language that likely exaggerates the nature of the actions: "secretly paved the way," "cutting quiet deals, behind closed doors," "desperate to get a deal." Minimizes potential justifications or context for the Obama administration's actions.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: While discussing US policy and interests, there are no explicit appeals to patriotism or national identity (e.g., "support our troops," "defend America").
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged or biased terms: "secretly," "quietly," "behind closed doors," "rogue nation," "desperate," "misled," "pressured," "calculated and secretive efforts," "back channel."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparison to Hitler, Nazis, or other universally hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: There is no appeal to the popularity of the idea being presented (e.g., "everyone knows," "most Americans agree").
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text presents a complex sequence of events (sanctions relief, currency conversion attempts, bank refusals) without attributing a major outcome to a single, overly simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is relatively direct and specific in its accusations and descriptions of events, citing sources (Senate report, Washington Times) and details (dollar amount, banks involved, dates). It does not rely on deliberately unclear language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Relies heavily on the Senate report ("A new Senate report reveals," "according to the Senate report," "Senate investigators said," "Mr. Portman said") and Sigal Mandelker's statements as evidence to support its claims against the Obama administration.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: The text presents the Obama administration's actions as deceptive and wrong, but it doesn't frame the *overall issue* (Iran nuclear deal, sanctions) as having only two simplistic choices. It focuses on the specific allegation of deception.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: No phrases like "it is what it is," "that's just common sense," or "end of story" are used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the allegation that the Obama administration secretly tried to facilitate Iranian access to the US financial system and misled Congress. It doesn't introduce major irrelevant topics to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text attacks the Obama administration based on its *actual* reported actions (issuing a license, pressuring banks, making assurances to Congress) and alleged deception. It doesn't misrepresent a weaker counter-argument to refute.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text criticizes the Obama administration's actions directly. It does not deflect by accusing critics (e.g., Democrats, Obama supporters) of hypocrisy on unrelated issues (e.g., "What about when Bush did X?").

**Verdict – 90% – Explanation:** The text exhibits multiple hallmarks of propaganda. It heavily employs **Loaded Language** ("secretly," "rogue nation," "desperate," "misled"), **Name Calling** ("rogue nation"), **Doubt** (repeated accusations of deception), **Exaggeration/Minimization** (using "secretly/desperate" likely overstates the case while downplaying context), and **Appeal to Authority** (relying on a partisan Senate report). It also includes an **Appeal to Fear** regarding Iran's nuclear program and terrorism financing. The overall framing is one-sided, presenting the Obama administration's actions as inherently deceptive and damaging without providing counter-perspective or nuance. The source (Freedom Outpost) and the inclusion of a poll asking "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" further signal a strong partisan bias. While it reports on an actual Senate investigation and includes factual details, the selective presentation, inflammatory language, and clear agenda (discrediting Obama and supporting the narrative of his administration's dishonesty regarding Iran) strongly indicate propagandistic intent. The lack of opposing viewpoints or attempts at balanced analysis pushes the likelihood very high.
