Verdict – 70% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy.

While not every technique is present, the use of emotionally charged language and appeals to authority suggest a strong likelihood that the text is intended as propaganda to influence the audience's perception and actions.
