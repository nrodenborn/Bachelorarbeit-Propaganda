1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses the term "enemedia" to attack the media, combining the words "enemy" and "media" into an insulting label.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – Yes – The headline uses short, impactful, and memorable phrases taken from the story to create a slogan-like effect: ""Raise An Army" "Killing Non-Believers On Behalf Of Allah"".
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses phrases like "jihad slaughter" and "killing non-believers" to instill fear in the reader about the group's intentions.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the media by accusing them of "scrubbing and censoring this story" and refers to them as the "enemedia."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author's commentary uses the term "jihad slaughter," which is an exaggeration of the reported plan to "get an army together" and "train them for jihad." "Slaughter" is a more graphic and emotionally charged term.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The inclusion of a poll about who should be the next U.S. ambassador to the U.N. injects a sense of national politics and identity into a story about a domestic crime, subtly appealing to the reader's sense of patriotism and national security.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with loaded language, such as "jihad slaughter" and "enemedia," which are chosen to evoke strong emotional reactions rather than for their literal meaning.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is good simply because it is popular or that "everyone is doing it."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text frames the entire complex situation as being caused solely by the group's religion, as summarized in the headline: "Muslim Teen From NM Islamic Compound Trained For Jihad." This ignores other potential factors like poverty, mental health, or individual radicalization.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; it is very direct and blunt in its accusations and framing.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly cites an "FBI special agent," an "affidavit filed in U.S. District Court," and "Reuters" to lend credibility and authority to the information being presented.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a simple binary: it is either a "jihad training camp" as the author claims, or it is a legitimate exercise of "freedom of religion" as the defense absurdly claims. It leaves no room for nuance or alternative interpretations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "There it is." is used after quoting the defense's position, serving to dismiss their argument without engaging with it and discouraging further critical thought from the reader.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll, "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?", is completely irrelevant to the story about the New Mexico compound and serves to distract the reader and collect user data.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text presents the defense's argument as simply "'freedom of religion,' calling this prosecution 'islamophobia.'" It then refutes this oversimplified version by detailing the horrific acts, misrepresenting the complex legal argument of a First Amendment defense as a simple and absurd claim.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy on an unrelated issue.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and overt example of propaganda. It does not simply report facts; it strategically frames them to elicit a specific emotional and ideological response from the reader. The piece begins and ends with the author's highly biased commentary, which uses inflammatory and loaded language ("jihad slaughter," "enemedia"). It employs a multitude of propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, and logical fallacies like the straw man and black & white fallacy to discredit any opposing viewpoint. A key strategy is the use of an appeal to authority (citing the FBI and Reuters) to give its biased framing a veneer of factual credibility. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring poll further demonstrates that the article's purpose is not objective journalism but persuasion and agenda-setting. The overall goal is to provoke fear and anger towards a specific group and to reinforce a particular worldview, which is the defining characteristic of propaganda.
