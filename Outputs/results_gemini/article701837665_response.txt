1. Name calling – Yes – The text attacks the “mainstream media” by calling them naive and “forever wedded to the official story no matter how ridiculous and illogical it is.” It also describes those who believe the official story as having a “mindset of conformity and deference to authority.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses phrases like “CIA’s cover-up,” “national security,” and “regime-change operation” to reinforce its central message. The idea of a “deal” between Trump and the CIA is also mentioned numerous times.

3. Slogans – Yes – The title, “The JFK Cover-Up Continues,” functions as a slogan. Phrases like “A blind man could see what was happening” and “Don’t make me laugh” are used as brief, memorable, and dismissive statements to reinforce a point.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear of a powerful, secret "national-security establishment" that can assassinate a U.S. president and successfully cover it up for over 50 years, implying this unaccountable power is a threat to the public and democracy.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is an exercise in creating doubt about the official narrative. For example, it questions the credibility of the CIA, the mainstream media, and the official reasons for secrecy, stating, “The notion that the CIA suddenly hit Trump yesterday with a new argument... is, well, laughable.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author uses hyperbole to ridicule the official stance on secrecy, sarcastically suggesting the argument was that “the United States would fall into the ocean” if the records were released. He also exaggerates his certainty about the "deal" by calling it a "virtual certainly."

7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism. Instead, it portrays U.S. institutions like the CIA and the "national-security establishment" as antagonistic to the country's best interests.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like “cover-up,” “ridiculous,” “laughable,” “naivete,” “patsy,” and “incriminating circumstantial evidence” to steer the reader’s emotions.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or the Nazis to discredit them.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular. It does the opposite, appealing to a select group of “critical, analytical, independent” thinkers against the supposedly conformist majority.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author reduces the complex political decision to delay the release of the files to a single, simple cause: a specific quid-pro-quo deal between Trump and the CIA regarding the Russia investigation, which is presented as a definitive fact rather than one of many possibilities.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s argument, while highly speculative, is presented clearly and directly. He is not trying to confuse the reader with obscure language; he is trying to convince them of a specific theory.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites Douglas Horne, highlighting that he “served on the staff of the Assassination Records Review Board,” to lend credibility to his argument. He also repeatedly cites his own previous articles as evidence.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false choice between two types of people: those with a “mindset of conformity and deference to authority” who believe the official story, and those with a “critical, analytical, independent mindset” who see the “truth” as the author presents it.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like “A blind man could see what was happening” and “Let’s state the obvious” to frame speculative opinions as undeniable facts, discouraging further discussion or critical thought.

16. Red herring – Yes – The author introduces the complex and unrelated topic of the Trump-Russia investigation and speculatively links it to the JFK files. This serves to distract from the core issue and build a more elaborate conspiracy, which is not based on evidence from the files themselves.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an absurd version of the "national security" argument by saying no one believes “the United States would fall into the ocean.” This misrepresents the official (though debatable) argument to make it seem ridiculous and easy to defeat.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text is on the offensive and does not use the technique of deflecting criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and comprehensive example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform objectively but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly speculative, and conspiratorial worldview. This is achieved through the pervasive use of a majority of the propaganda techniques listed (14 out of 18).

The author systematically builds a narrative by creating an enemy (the "national-security establishment" and the "mainstream media") through Name Calling and Loaded Language. He then dismantles the official story using Straw Men and Exaggeration while casting Doubt on all official sources.

In its place, he constructs an alternative reality based on Causal Oversimplification (the Trump/CIA/Russia deal) and presents it as the only logical conclusion for any "critical" thinker, a classic use of the Black & White Fallacy. The argument is peppered with Thought-Terminating Clichés ("Let's state the obvious") to shut down dissent and relies on select Appeals to Authority to give it a veneer of credibility. The entire piece is designed to provoke an emotional response (fear of a shadow government, indignation at being lied to) rather than a rational analysis of verifiable facts. The goal is indoctrination into a belief system, which is the essence of propaganda.
