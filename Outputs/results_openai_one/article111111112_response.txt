Certainly! Here is the analysis of each propaganda technique as applied to the text:

---

1. **Name calling** – Yes – The text refers to Geller and Spencer as "anti-Muslim activists" and links them to the "far-right EDL," both of which are negative labels.
2. **Repetition** – No – There is no significant repetition of a particular message or phrase.
3. **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable slogans used in the text.
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text mentions concerns that Geller and Spencer may "foster hatred" and "lead to inter-community violence," which appeals to fear of social unrest.
5. **Doubt** – Yes – The text questions the intentions of Geller and Spencer, suggesting they "only wanted to come here and help the EDL stir up more trouble."
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The phrase "the nation that gave the world the Magna Carta is dead" is an exaggeration by Geller and Spencer.
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – References to "the nation that gave the world the Magna Carta" and "land of democracy and freedom of speech" appeal to national identity and patriotism.
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Terms like "extreme anti-Muslim activists," "inflammatory speakers," and "foster hatred" are emotionally charged.
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There is no comparison to Nazis or similarly hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to popularity or suggestion that everyone agrees.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The claim that allowing Geller and Spencer into the UK would directly "foster hatred" and "lead to inter-community violence" oversimplifies the causes of such violence.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – Phrases like "not conducive to the public good" and "unacceptable behaviours" are vague and not clearly defined.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The Home Office, Home Secretary, and Keith Vaz are cited as authorities supporting the ban.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text frames the issue as either banning Geller and Spencer or allowing hate to spread, presenting only two options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Phrases like "This is the right decision" and "Britain doesn't need more hate" shut down further debate.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The mention of "how many hate preachers are living in this country?" by Tommy Robinson distracts from the issue of Geller and Spencer.
17. **Straw men** – Yes – The claim that Geller and Spencer "only wanted to come here and help the EDL stir up more trouble" misrepresents their stated purpose (to lay flowers).
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Tommy Robinson's statement "How many hate preachers are living in this country?" is a classic whataboutism, deflecting criticism by pointing to others.

**Final verdict:**

**Verdict – 85% – The text contains a high number of propaganda techniques, including name calling, appeal to fear, loaded language, appeal to authority, and others. The narrative is framed to justify the ban and delegitimize Geller and Spencer, often using emotionally charged or vague language, and presenting the issue in black-and-white terms. While the text does report on statements from both sides, the overall framing and choice of language strongly suggest an intent to persuade the audience of the rightness of the ban and the dangers posed by the individuals in question, rather than neutrally informing.**
