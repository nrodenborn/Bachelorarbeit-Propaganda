Verdict – 95% – Explanation: The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs a significant number of propaganda techniques (12 out of 18), including name-calling, appeal to fear, loaded language, and exaggeration. The narrative is extremely one-sided, relying solely on sources that support its biased viewpoint while demonizing the subject. The language is emotionally charged and inflammatory, designed not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of the mayor and, by extension, the entire Democratic party. The piece culminates in a red herring and a gross exaggeration ("Dems have become honorary members of MS-13"), which moves it from biased reporting into the realm of pure propaganda.
