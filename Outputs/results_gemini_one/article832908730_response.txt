Verdict – 10% – The text is a news report, and its primary purpose is to inform the public about the conclusion of the Mueller investigation by presenting facts and quoting relevant figures. It is not structured as a piece of propaganda. However, it does contain elements that fit the technical definitions of propaganda techniques. The use of "Name calling" is a direct quote from President Trump, reported as a fact of his response. The use of "Loaded Language" is very mild (e.g., "clamor," "transfixed") and falls within the realm of common journalistic practice. "Appeal to authority" is fundamental to news reporting, as journalists cite official sources to convey information. Because these techniques are present but are not used with the clear intent to manipulate or deceive the audience, the text has a very low likelihood of being propaganda.
