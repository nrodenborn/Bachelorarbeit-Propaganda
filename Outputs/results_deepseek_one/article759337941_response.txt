### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "The Democrats are criminal, treasonous and sleazy," "this jihadi," "Muslim spies," "jihad-treason."  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" repeated three times.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Hellbent to destroy President Trump" (memorable phrase emphasizing urgency).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "He then transferred the data to Pakistan," "national security secrets," "nefarious purposes," implying catastrophic espionage.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Accidentally? Color me skeptical," questioning the legitimacy of evidence handling.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: "biggest story of treason and espionage in recent memory." Minimization: Downplaying Capitol Police error as intentional collusion.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No overt appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Treasonous," "sleazy," "jihadi," "collusion," "Soviet fictions," "nefarious purposes" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – "Soviet fictions" implicitly links Democrats to totalitarian regimes.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – The poll invites readers to join a collective judgment against Democrats.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames Democrats entirely for espionage: "Democrat leadership collusion with Muslim spies."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Claims are direct and inflammatory, not vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – No cited authoritative sources; relies on anonymous "source."  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Portrays Democrats as universally corrupt: "The Democrats are criminal... protect jihad-treason."  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "The media goes to extraordinary lengths not to cover it" shuts down critical inquiry.  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Focus remains on the alleged scandal without irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Opposing arguments are not misrepresented; the text attacks the alleged scandal directly.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting opponents' past actions.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **overwhelmingly propagandistic**. It systematically employs:  
- **Dehumanizing language** ("jihadi," "Muslim spies") to vilify subjects.  
- **Fear-mongering** about treason and national security breaches.  
- **Repetition and slogans** to reinforce bias.  
- **Conspiracy framing** (e.g., media suppression, Democrat collusion).  
- **Lack of verifiable evidence**, relying on emotionally loaded claims (e.g., data sent to Pakistan) without substantiation.  
- **Us-vs-them polarization**, painting Democrats as monolithic traitors.  

While not *every* technique is used, the text’s core purpose is to manipulate perception through inflammatory rhetoric, distortion of facts, and tribalistic appeals. Its tone, structure, and selective framing align with propaganda objectives: to provoke outrage, reinforce preconceived narratives, and discourage critical analysis. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the *potential* underlying facts (e.g., the IT scandal), but their presentation is deliberately weaponized to serve a partisan agenda.
