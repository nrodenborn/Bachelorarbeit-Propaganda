Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No. No insulting labels are used against any subject.
2.  **Repetition** – No. No specific message is repeated over and over for emphasis.
3.  **Slogans** – No. No brief, memorable persuasive phrases are used.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No. No attempt is made to instill fear against alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – No. The credibility of Mueller or the investigation is not directly questioned. (Statements *about* doubt, like Grassley's "we still haven’t seen any evidence of collusion," are reported but not used *by the text itself* to sow doubt about the investigation's credibility).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No. Events and statements are reported factually without obvious exaggeration or minimization by the text itself.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No. No appeal to patriotism or identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No. The language used is generally neutral and descriptive. Words like "speculation and innuendo" (used by Grassley) are reported quotes, not the text's own language.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No. No idea is disapproved by linking it to a hated group.
10. **Bandwagon** – No. No appeal is made based on the popularity of an idea.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No. No complex event is attributed to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No. The reporting is clear about the events (report submitted, reactions given). The *content* of the report is unknown, but the text clearly states that it is being reviewed and will be summarized/released, not using vagueness to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No. While authorities (Mueller, Barr, lawmakers) are cited reporting facts or opinions, their authority is not used *as evidence* to support a specific claim within the text itself. The text reports *their* statements.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No. The text presents multiple perspectives (Justice Dept., Trump lawyers, Democrats, Grassley) without forcing a simplistic either/or choice on the reader.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No. No phrases are used that shut down critical thought. Quotes like "finally put an end to the speculation and innuendo" (Grassley) are presented as opinions, not as clichés used by the text to end discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No. All information presented is relevant to the core event: the submission of the Mueller report and the reactions to it.
17. **Straw men** – No. No arguments are misrepresented or refuted. The text reports statements directly.
18. **Whataboutism** – No. No opponent is charged with hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is overwhelmingly a straightforward news report relaying factual developments (the report's submission) and directly quoting reactions from various involved parties (Justice Dept., Trump's lawyers, Democrat lawmakers, Sen. Grassley). It presents multiple perspectives without overtly favoring one. There is no discernible attempt by the *text itself* to persuade the audience using emotional manipulation, misleading logic, or the specific techniques listed. The 5% acknowledges that quotes *within* the text (like Grassley's warning about harming discourse or keeping the collusion narrative alive) contain elements of rhetoric that *could* be interpreted as having a persuasive intent from *his* perspective, but the *text reporting* these quotes remains neutral and factual. The primary function is informative, not propagandistic.
