Verdict – 75% – The text employs several propaganda techniques such as name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to create a negative perception of Sweden and its handling of immigration and crime, suggesting a high likelihood of the text being propaganda. However, not all possible techniques are present, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood.
