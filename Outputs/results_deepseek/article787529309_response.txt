Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "despicable tactic," "lowest level of character assassination," "contemptible, obstructionist tactics," "shameless smear campaign," "Democrat obstructionists."  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on "last-minute" timing (e.g., "less than a week before," "eleventh hour," "4 days before," "suddenly come to light").  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "character assassination" (used repeatedly as a rallying phrase against Democrats).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Implies confirming Kavanaugh without delay prevents manipulation ("reeks of a set-up," "reminiscent of Anita Hill").  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions Ford’s credibility: "story becomes murky," "fall apart," "does not remember key details," "gaping hole in therapist’s notes."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – *Exaggeration*: "cesspool of public gossip," "lowest level of character assassination." *Minimization*: Downplaying Ford’s allegation as "decades-old purported teenage sexual mischief."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Praises Kavanaugh’s "lifetime record of stellar public service" and "eminently qualified" status.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Despicable," "character assassination," "contemptible," "smear campaign," "shadowy corner," "torpedo," "debased themselves."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Cites 65 women vouching for Kavanaugh to imply broad consensus about his character.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes Democrats’ actions solely to ideology: "for ideological reasons," "to block... by all means necessary."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are direct, not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Uses FBI’s decision not to investigate and background checks as proof of innocence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Portrays Kavanaugh as entirely honorable ("always treated women with decency") vs. Democrats as purely malicious ("ideological" obstructionists).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Shameless smear campaign," "character assassination" – shuts down nuance about the allegation.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – References Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy to accuse Democrats of hypocrisy, diverting from Ford’s allegation.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – No clear misrepresentation of an unstated argument.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – "Feminists gave Bill Clinton a free pass... Senator Feinstein called Ted Kennedy an inspiration" – deflects criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy.  

---

**Verdict – 95%** – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least **15 of 18 techniques** analyzed, systematically attacking Democrats while absolving Kavanaugh. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotionally charged language** ("despicable," "smear," "cesspool") to vilify opponents.  
- **Dismissal of evidence** through selective framing (e.g., highlighting gaps in Ford’s memory while ignoring her detailed account).  
- **False equivalences** (comparing Ford’s allegation to unproven "set-ups" like Anita Hill).  
- **Ad hominem attacks** (labeling critics "obstructionists").  
- **Narrative control** by emphasizing timing ("last-minute") to imply bad faith, while downplaying Feinstein’s stated rationale for initially withholding the letter.  
- **Hypocrisy deflection** (Clinton/Kennedy references) to avoid engaging substantively.  
The text’s one-sidedness, lack of neutral framing, and reliance on emotional manipulation over balanced analysis confirm its function as propaganda opposing Kavanaugh’s critics. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges factual elements (e.g., dates, quotes), but these are weaponized to serve the propagandistic goal.
