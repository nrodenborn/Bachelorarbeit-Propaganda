### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:  

1. **Name calling** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: No insulting labels are directly used against targets (e.g., "ridiculous" critiques media outrage but isn’t a personal slur).  

2. **Repetition** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation*: The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated verbatim three times.  

3. **Slogans** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation*: The headline "Liberals Agree – Trump Tougher on Putin than Obama Was" acts as a brief, memorable phrase framing the narrative.  

4. **Appeal to fear** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: No attempt to instill fear about alternatives (e.g., no warnings about consequences of opposing Trump).  

5. **Doubt** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation*: Greenwald questions media credibility: "the leftwing media keeps getting so riled up at everything that Trump does... mystifying."  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation*: Minimizes Trump’s rapport with Putin by calling allegations "the kind of stuff you believe if you read too many Tom Clancy novels," downplaying concerns.  

7. **Flag-Waving** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  

8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation*: Emotional terms like "fascist" (for Duterte), "repressive" (Saudi leaders), and "Helsinki Hulabaloo" (mocking media outrage) evoke stereotypes.  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: No association of ideas with hated groups (e.g., Nazis).  

10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: The headline "Liberals Agree" implies widespread consensus to persuade readers.  

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Attributes media outrage solely to anti-Trump bias, ignoring complex factors: "the media’s constant flow of outrage [is] mystifying."  

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No**  
    *Explanation*: Arguments are specific (e.g., listing Trump’s actions against Russia), not deliberately vague.  

13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Uses Glenn Greenwald (a left-wing journalist) as an authority to validate the pro-Trump narrative: "Greenwald told the leftists at Democracy Now!"  

14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Presents Trump as either a "puppet" or "tougher" than Obama, ignoring nuances in Russia relations.  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Phrases like "isn’t borne out by the facts" dismiss criticisms without engagement.  

16. **Red herring** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Shifts focus from Trump/Putin ties by listing other leaders Trump doesn’t criticize (Netanyahu, Saudi rulers).  

17. **Straw men** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Misrepresents critics as claiming Putin "controls [Trump] with blackmail," an extreme position not broadly held.  

18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Defends Trump’s lack of Putin criticism by citing other authoritarian leaders he also doesn’t criticize: "Putin is not the only leader."

### Verdict – 75%  
**Explanation**: The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques (e.g., Bandwagon, Loaded Language, Whataboutism, Straw Men) to advance a pro-Trump narrative. It selectively presents facts (Trump’s actions vs. Obama’s) while dismissing media criticism as irrational. The repetitive poll, sensationalized headline, and deflection tactics (e.g., red herrings) aim to persuade rather than inform. However, it includes verifiable claims (e.g., arms to Ukraine, Iran deal), preventing a 100% rating. The framing—using a left-wing figure to endorse right-wing policies—exploits partisan divides, making it primarily propagandistic in intent. Context (source: Constitution.com, a conservative site) further supports this assessment.
