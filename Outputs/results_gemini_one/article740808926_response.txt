Name calling – Yes – The headline, "Illegal Alien Wife Beaters Protected by Sanctuary City Mayor Busted," uses insulting labels to attack the subjects of the article and, by extension, the mayor who allegedly protected them.

Repetition – No – The text reinforces a central theme, but it does not use the technique of repeating the same specific word or phrase multiple times to achieve its effect.

Slogans – Yes – The phrase "Sanctuary cities are the real war on women" is a brief, memorable phrase designed to frame the issue in a provocative way and stick in the reader's mind.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text repeatedly highlights violent crimes ("robbery and gun crimes," "battery of a spouse," "corporal injury of a spouse") to instill fear in the reader about the potential consequences of sanctuary city policies.

Doubt – Yes – The quote from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, "How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers to promote a radical, open borders agenda," is used to directly question the motives and credibility of Mayor Schaaf.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline, "Illegal Alien Wife Beaters Protected by Sanctuary City Mayor Busted," exaggerates by applying the specific crimes of a few individuals as a general, sensationalist label for a larger group.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use appeals to patriotism, national symbols, or identity to make its case.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "real war on women" and "radical, open borders agenda" to appeal to emotions and stereotypes rather than reason.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other universally hated historical groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular or that "everyone is doing it."

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex event by stating, "Three illegal immigrants, who avoided capture after Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf blew the whistle on a raid... have since been re-arrested for new crimes," directly blaming the mayor's single action for subsequent, unrelated criminal acts.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and specific in its accusations and is not deliberately unclear or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The article heavily relies on the statements of "Attorney General Jeff Sessions" and "ICE officials" to lend credibility and support to its claims.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the issue as a simple choice between supporting law enforcement against dangerous criminals or supporting sanctuary policies that endanger the public, ignoring any other nuanced perspectives or reasons for such policies.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The slogan "Sanctuary cities are the real war on women" functions as a thought-terminating cliché by reframing a complex political debate in simplistic, emotionally charged terms that discourage nuanced discussion.

Red herring – No – The article remains highly focused on its central argument and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the audience.

Straw men – Yes – The text attacks a misrepresentation of sanctuary city policies by claiming they are part of a "radical, open borders agenda," rather than addressing the actual arguments made by their proponents.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge the opponent with hypocrisy by deflecting with a "what about you?" argument.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a powerful combination of techniques to bypass rational thought and provoke an emotional response in the reader. The piece begins with inflammatory **Name-calling** and **Loaded Language** in the headline to establish an immediate bias. It builds its case on an **Appeal to fear** by focusing exclusively on violent crimes. The argument is structured around a **Causal Oversimplification**, blaming the mayor for these crimes, and a **Black & White Fallacy** that presents no alternative viewpoint. It uses an **Appeal to Authority** (ICE, Jeff Sessions) to legitimize its one-sided narrative while attacking a **Straw Man** version of sanctuary policies ("radical, open borders agenda"). The use of a memorable **Slogan** ("Sanctuary cities are the real war on women") further serves to distill a complex issue into a simplistic, emotionally charged, and easily repeatable phrase. The sheer number and coordinated use of these techniques indicate a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than to inform.
