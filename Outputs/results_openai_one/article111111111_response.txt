**Verdict – 40% –**  
The text contains some elements of propaganda, notably appeal to fear, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and appeal to authority. These techniques are used to emphasize the seriousness of the plague situation and the potential for future outbreaks. However, the majority of the text is factual, informative, and based on statements from a credible authority (WHO). The intent appears to be more about public health awareness and warning rather than manipulation for political or ideological purposes. Therefore, while some propaganda techniques are present, the overall likelihood that this is a piece of deliberate propaganda is moderate but not high.
