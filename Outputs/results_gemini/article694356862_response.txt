Here is the analysis of the text based on the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling – Yes –** The text uses insulting labels to attack its subjects, particularly the Obama administration and Iran. Examples include calling Obama's policy "reckless appeasement" and a "milquetoast approach," and labeling Iran the "radical Shiite Iranian regime."

2.  **Repetition – Yes –** The text repeatedly reinforces the core message that Iran is an expansionist threat and that the Obama administration's policies enabled it. The phrases "Shiite Crescent" and variations of Iran's aggression and Obama's failures appear throughout the text to hammer the point home.

3.  **Slogans – Yes –** The text uses the brief, memorable phrase "Shiite Crescent" repeatedly to encapsulate the perceived threat of Iranian expansion. It also uses the quote "It’s a new monster" as a punchy, memorable summary of the situation.

4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes –** The text works to instill fear of Iran's power and intentions. Examples include describing Iran as a "hegemonic threat," a "threat to international peace and security," and warning of its "path to eventually becoming a nuclear-armed state" and its shipment of rockets for "future use against Israeli population centers."

5.  **Doubt – Yes –** The text is built around questioning the credibility and competence of the Obama administration's foreign policy. Statements like "Obama turned his back on millions of dissidents" and calling the nuclear deal "disastrous" are intended to make the reader doubt the wisdom and effectiveness of his decisions.

6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes –** The text exaggerates the negative aspects of its targets and minimizes complexities. Calling Iraq a "virtual vassal state" of Iran is an exaggeration. Conversely, describing the Obama administration's strategy as a "milquetoast approach" is a minimization that dismisses any complex strategic reasoning behind it.

7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes –** The text appeals to patriotism and national identity, particularly American and Israeli. It does this by framing the issue as a "threat to U.S. interests" and by noting that "Hezbollah has American blood on its hands," which is a direct appeal to American patriotic sentiment.

8.  **Loaded Language – Yes –** The text is filled with words and phrases chosen to evoke a strong emotional response rather than to be objective. Examples include "reckless appeasement," "disastrous nuclear deal," "terrorist proxy Hezbollah," and "radical Shiite Iranian regime."

9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes –** The text disapproves of Obama's policy by linking it to a concept hated by the audience. The use of the term "appeasement" ("Barack Obama's reckless appeasement") is a classic example, as it deliberately evokes the failed appeasement of Hitler in the 1930s, thereby associating Obama's diplomacy with a historically catastrophic policy.

10. **Bandwagon – No –** The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular or that "everyone" believes it. It relies on appeals to authority and fear, not on an appeal to popularity.

11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes –** The text presents simple causes for highly complex events. For example, it states that Obama's removal of troops from Iraq directly gave "rise to ISIS’s re-emergence," ignoring many other contributing political and social factors in the region.

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No –** The text is not vague or confusing. Its purpose is to deliver a very clear, direct, and persuasive message. Its claims, while biased, are stated plainly.

13. **Appeal to authority – Yes –** The text quotes several individuals and presents them as experts to lend credibility to its argument. Examples include quoting "Andrew Tabler, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy" and "National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster."

14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes –** The text presents the situation as a simple choice between two options: the Obama administration's weak "appeasement" (bad) and a forceful, confrontational approach by Israel and the Trump administration (good). This ignores the vast spectrum of other possible diplomatic and strategic options.

15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes –** The text uses phrases that discourage critical thought by offering a simple, final-sounding judgment. Describing the situation as "a new monster" serves to end nuanced discussion with a powerful, frightening label.

16. **Red herring – No –** The text remains highly focused on its central argument about Iran, Obama, and Israel. It does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the reader from the main point.

17. **Straw men – Yes –** The text refutes a distorted and oversimplified version of its opponent's argument. It characterizes the Obama administration's Iran policy simply as "appeasement" and a "milquetoast approach," ignoring the complex, multinational diplomatic framework of the Iran nuclear deal, making this simplified version easier to attack.

18. **Whataboutism – No –** The text is a direct attack on a subject and does not use the technique of deflecting criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

***

**Verdict – 95% –** This text is a clear and potent piece of propaganda. It is not an objective news report or a balanced analysis; it is a persuasive article written to promote a specific political viewpoint. The likelihood is extremely high because it employs a vast majority (14 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques. The entire piece is constructed not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a conclusion: that the Obama administration's policies were a dangerous failure and that an aggressive stance against Iran is necessary and justified. It achieves this through a relentless use of loaded language, name-calling, and appeals to fear. It builds its case on logical fallacies like causal oversimplification and the black & white fallacy, while refuting a straw man version of opposing policies. The one-sided selection of quotes from authorities who support its thesis, combined with a patriotic framing, leaves no room for nuance or critical thought, guiding the reader to a pre-determined conclusion.
