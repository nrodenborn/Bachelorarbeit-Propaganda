1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to subjects. Terms like "gang violence" and "populist" are descriptive.  
2. **Repetition** – No – Key messages aren't repeatedly hammered; information is presented sequentially.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, rallying phrases (e.g., "whatever it takes" is contextual, not a crafted slogan).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – *"People are shot to death in pizza restaurants, people are killed by hand grenades..."* (vivid descriptions emphasize danger).  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility (e.g., institutions are cited neutrally).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Statistics (e.g., 106 murders in 2016) are reported factually.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism/national identity.

12. **Obfuscation** – No – Language is clear and specific.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Quotes are attributed but not used as unquestionable proof.

**Verdict – 15% –**  
The text primarily functions as **factual reporting**, citing statistics (e.g., 106 murders in 2016), government policies ($880M funding), and attributed quotes. However, limited propaganda elements appear:  
1. **Sweden Democrat leader’s sarcasm** ("multicultural paradise") uses *loaded language* to provoke disdain.  
2. **Crime-immigration linkage** by the Sweden Democrats employs *causal oversimplification*.  
3. **Vivid violence descriptions** ("shot in pizza restaurants") *appeal to fear*.  
These elements occupy ~15% of the text and are attributed to political figures, not the article’s voice. The core structure remains journalistic—presenting multiple perspectives (PM, opposition, crime council) without overt manipulation. Propaganda techniques are *present but not dominant*, reflecting political rhetoric within an informational framework.
