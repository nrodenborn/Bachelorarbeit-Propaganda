Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and straw men. These techniques suggest a moderate likelihood of the text being propaganda, as they aim to influence the reader's perception of the debate between Douthat and Faggioli by undermining Faggioli's credibility and presenting a biased interpretation of his arguments. However, the text also provides a detailed account of the debate, which adds some level of balance and context.
