1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the term "criminal aliens" to label the people arrested, which is an insulting label that conflates their immigration status with criminality. Example: "ICE arrests 145 in South and Central Texas during 7-day operation targeting criminal aliens"
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the idea that the operation is about public safety and targeting criminals. Example: The phrase "public safety" appears three times, and the term "criminal" is used in reference to the arrestees over ten times (e.g., "criminal aliens," "criminal convictions," "criminal histories," "criminal charges," "criminal summaries").
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the style of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text lists serious and frightening crimes to instill fear, suggesting that these individuals pose a significant threat to the public. Example: "Most of the aliens targeted... had prior criminal histories that included convictions for the following crimes: indecency with a child, assault, deadly conduct, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, drug possession, drug trafficking..."
5. Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any other person or entity; it presents itself as a factual report.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the criminality of the group by providing three detailed summaries of the most serious offenders, while minimizing the fact that 59 of the 145 arrested (over 40%) had no criminal convictions. Example: The text provides lengthy "criminal summaries" for three individuals with severe criminal histories but offers no details about the 59 individuals without criminal records.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national security to justify its actions. Example: "ICE deportation officers carry out targeted enforcement operations daily nationwide as part of the agency’s ongoing efforts to protect the nation, uphold public safety, and protect the integrity of our immigration laws and border controls."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged terms to influence the audience's perception. Example: The terms "criminal aliens," "illegal alien," and "threat to public safety" are used to evoke fear and negative stereotypes.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its position is popular or that the reader should agree because others do.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause-and-effect relationship: arresting immigrants leads directly to public safety, ignoring the complex factors that contribute to crime. Example: “The results of this operation are a clear indication of ICE’s commitment regarding the role we play in keeping our communities safe by locating, arresting and ultimately removing at-large criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety...”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – While providing specific numbers, the text is vague in ways that serve its narrative. It lists many serious crimes but does not specify how many of the 86 convictions were for those crimes versus less serious offenses like illegal entry. Example: The list of crimes "included convictions for..." is not quantified, leaving the impression that many were for the most serious offenses listed.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses a quote from an official to lend credibility and weight to its message. Example: "said Daniel Bible, field office director for ERO in San Antonio." His statement is used to frame the entire operation as a success for public safety.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a binary choice: people are either in compliance with immigration law or they are a threat subject to removal, ignoring any middle ground or nuance. Example: "All of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and – if found removable by final order – removal from the United States."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion.
16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on the enforcement action and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an opponent's argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 90% – The text is a government press release, a form of communication that often uses persuasive techniques to shape public opinion. While it contains factual data (numbers, dates, locations), its primary purpose is not neutral reporting but persuasion. It heavily employs numerous propaganda techniques to achieve its goal. The use of loaded language and name-calling ("criminal aliens") dehumanizes the subjects. The strong appeal to fear, achieved by highlighting the most severe crimes and exaggerating the threat through selective case summaries, is designed to provoke an emotional response. This is reinforced by repetition of the "public safety" theme and appeals to patriotism (flag-waving). The text oversimplifies the complex issue of crime and immigration into a simple narrative of "good vs. evil" and uses an appeal to authority to validate this narrative. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to influence the reader's perception and garner support for the agency's actions, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
