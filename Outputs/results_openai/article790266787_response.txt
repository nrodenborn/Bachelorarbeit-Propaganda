Verdict – 85% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, flag-waving, loaded language, bandwagon, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to present a one-sided narrative that discredits the accusers and supports Kavanaugh's confirmation, suggesting a high likelihood that the text is propaganda. The use of emotionally charged language and appeals to conservative identity further reinforce this assessment.
