Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. The article consistently uses loaded and emotional language (e.g., "jihad spies," "treason," "hellbent") to provoke an emotional response rather than a rational one. It creates a simplistic, black-and-white worldview where the Democratic party and the media are colluding in a treasonous plot, a claim it inflates with exaggeration ("biggest story of treason and espionage"). The piece systematically works to discredit any opposing information or lack of coverage by attributing it to a simple, malicious cause (Causal Oversimplification) and misrepresenting other news as "Soviet fictions" (Straw Man). The use of a poll, repetition, and appeals to in-group knowledge ("Longtime Geller Report readers") are all designed to foster a sense of shared belief and urgency. The sheer density and combination of these techniques demonstrate that the article's intent is to manipulate the reader's opinion, making it a clear and potent example of propaganda.
