Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Don Lemon Is Lying... Again", "Is Don Lemon colorblind?", "Is the FBI racist (and maybe a bit sexist)?", "spewing more fake news".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "fake news" is used as a dismissive label for CNN's reporting.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The repeated poll question about using military force against the "caravan of migrants" invokes fear of an invading group.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The entire text is structured to create doubt about Don Lemon's credibility ("Lying... Again", "you are very wrong", "Is Don Lemon colorblind?") and the FBI's motives/impartiality ("Is the FBI racist (and maybe a bit sexist)?").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "Interestingly enough, it looks like the WOMEN in this country are currently responsible for more terrorism than WHITE MEN." This exaggerates the significance of the specific FBI list snapshot (5 women vs 3 white men) to make a sweeping claim about terrorism responsibility nationwide, minimizing the broader context and data Lemon might be referencing.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While the FBI list is used as an authority, there's no explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity as a primary argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "demonizing people" (used ironically when quoting Lemon, but the author engages in it), "absurdity", "spewing more fake news", "caravan of migrants" (often carries a loaded connotation), "your viewing pleasure" (sarcastic).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No suggestion that Lemon's views are popular with Nazis or similar universally hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – The poll ("take our poll") and the phrasing "*Yes*, military force should be used" presented first, coupled with "Completing this poll grants you access...", creates a bandwagon pressure to agree with the implied stance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – The text implies that the demographics on the specific FBI "Most Wanted Domestic Terrorists" list definitively prove Lemon wrong about the broader threat of right-wing radicalized white men, oversimplifying the complex issue of domestic terrorism threats and sources.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – "regardless of the list/filter you choose, you won’t find many 'white men'." and "No matter which category you choose, you won’t be finding many white men." are vague. It doesn't specify *which* categories or filters on the FBI site were checked, leaving the claim unverifiable from the text alone. Also, "spewing more fake news" is a vague accusation.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The core argument relies entirely on appealing to the authority of the FBI's "Most Wanted Domestic Terrorists" list as definitive proof against Lemon's statement.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – The poll presents only two extreme options regarding the migrant caravan: "Yes, military force should be used." or "No, keep the military out of it.", ignoring a spectrum of other possible responses or levels of intervention.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "fake news" is used as a thought-terminating cliché to dismiss CNN/Don Lemon's perspective without engaging with its substance.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The entire section about the migrant caravan poll is a red herring. It's completely irrelevant to the core argument about Don Lemon's statement on domestic terrorism threats and the FBI list. It serves to distract and inflame passions on a different topic.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – The text misrepresents Lemon's argument. Lemon spoke about the *biggest terror threat* being radicalized right-wing white men, based on broader trends and data. The author refutes this by pointing to the *specific individuals* on the FBI's *current* "Most Wanted" list for *domestic* terrorists, implying Lemon said *only* white men are terrorists or that they are the *only* ones wanted, which he did not. The "only 3 white men?" and "women... responsible for more" refutes a claim Lemon didn't make.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The author doesn't directly charge Lemon with hypocrisy by pointing to something contradictory Lemon or "his side" has done. The focus is on refuting his specific statement with the FBI list and introducing the unrelated caravan issue.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a high concentration of propaganda techniques (15 out of 18 analyzed are present) with the clear intent to discredit a specific media personality (Don Lemon) and his network (CNN), promote a specific political viewpoint regarding domestic terrorism threats and immigration, and rally readers against perceived media bias ("fake news"). The core argument relies heavily on misrepresentation (Straw Man), selective and potentially misleading use of data (Appeal to Authority, Exaggeration, Causal Oversimplification), emotional manipulation (Name Calling, Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear via the caravan poll), and distraction (Red Herring - caravan poll). The inclusion of the poll serves dual purposes: Bandwagon appeal and distraction. The language is consistently inflammatory and dismissive, aimed at provoking agreement and outrage rather than fostering critical analysis of the complex issues involved. While it uses a factual source (the FBI list), it does so in a highly selective, context-stripped, and misleading manner to serve its persuasive goal.
