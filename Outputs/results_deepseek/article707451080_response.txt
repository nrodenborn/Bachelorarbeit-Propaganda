### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
- **Systematic use of techniques**: Employs 14/18 identified methods (e.g., loaded language, fear appeals, bandwagon) to manipulate emotion.  
- **Agenda-driven framing**: Selectively presents facts (e.g., $15M payouts) while omitting context (e.g., time frame, investigation processes) to fuel outrage.  
- **Sensationalism**: Uses hyperbolic language ("disgusting," "predatory") and unverified anecdotes (Biden story) to vilify targets.  
- **Call to action**: Urges readers to "take our government back," implying a specific political agenda ("drain the swamp").  
- **Source bias**: Permission from "End of the American Dream" (a known partisan site) and Breitbart citation signal ideological slant.  

While based on real events (e.g., Speier’s testimony), the text’s manipulative construction overwhelms factual elements, aiming to provoke anger rather than inform. The 5% uncertainty reflects the presence of documented claims (e.g., harassment payouts), but the delivery aligns overwhelmingly with propagandistic goals.
