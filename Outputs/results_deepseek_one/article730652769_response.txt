Here's the analysis of the text using the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Repeatedly uses the term "illegal aliens," which is an inherently negative and legally contested label applied to the subjects of the report.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: No specific phrase or message is repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: The text contains no brief, memorable phrases designed for rallying or easy recall.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – Explanation: While the subject matter (stash houses, illegal immigration) can be sensitive, the text itself reports facts without explicitly trying to instill fear about consequences or alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not question the credibility of any person, group, or institution.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – Explanation: The report states numbers (60, 35, 25) and locations factually without apparent inflation or downplaying.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: The text mentions law enforcement actions but does not explicitly appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged terms with strong negative connotations: "illegal aliens" (instead of "undocumented immigrants" or "migrants") and "stash houses" (instead of "safe houses" or "residences"). These terms evoke criminality and dehumanization.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparison to Nazis, Hitler, or widely hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not suggest that an idea or action is good or correct because it is popular.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The report simply describes events without attributing complex issues to a single simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is relatively clear and specific about the events, locations, dates, numbers, and agencies involved, except for the final "No further details were released," which is standard reporting practice, not deliberate obfuscation within this context.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: While it cites official agencies (Border Patrol, HSI) reporting facts, it doesn't use their statements specifically as evidence *for* a broader ideological claim beyond the reported incident.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: The text presents a factual report of events without presenting only two extreme choices or options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: No phrases are used that shut down critical thinking or discussion (e.g., "it is what it is," "that's just common sense").
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the reported incidents of apprehensions and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text reports events; it does not present or refute any arguments.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not accuse anyone else of hypocrisy to deflect from the reported events.

**Verdict – 35% – Explanation:** The text primarily functions as a straightforward news report detailing specific law enforcement actions, providing dates, locations, numbers, and involved agencies. However, it employs **Loaded Language** ("illegal aliens," "stash houses") and engages in **Name calling** by persistently using the label "illegal aliens." This choice of terminology injects a clear bias, framing the individuals apprehended in a negative, criminalized light common in certain political discourses about immigration. While factual in its reporting of the events themselves, this deliberate language choice pushes the text towards propaganda by shaping the reader's perception through emotionally charged and dehumanizing labels. It does not, however, utilize other overtly manipulative techniques like fearmongering, oversimplification, or logical fallacies. The likelihood of it being propaganda is moderate (35%) due to this significant use of biased language within an otherwise factual structure.
