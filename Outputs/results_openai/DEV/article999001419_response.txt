Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as name calling, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, and appeal to authority. These elements suggest a moderate likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it appears to be crafted to influence the reader's perception of Acosta and the situation surrounding his press pass. However, it does not employ a wide range of techniques, and some parts of the text are straightforward in presenting facts and quotes, which slightly reduces the likelihood of it being pure propaganda.
