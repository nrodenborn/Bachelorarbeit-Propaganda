1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Islam as “the most vicious and brutal ideology on the face of the Earth” and labels the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) as a “Hamas-tied” organization and The Islamic Society of North America as a “Muslim Brotherhood front group.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?” is repeated three times in a row. The core concept of “Islamization” is also repeated throughout the text in various forms (“Islamizing the Schools,” “Stop the Islamization of America,” “increasing Islamization,” “forced Islamization”).

3. Slogans – Yes – The text prominently features the title of the author’s book, “Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance,” which functions as a memorable phrase to encapsulate her viewpoint.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text builds fear by linking a school assignment to a “vicious and brutal ideology,” Sharia law, and forced conversion. It heavily emphasizes this by including a detailed account of death threats against a parent and his young children, creating a sense of extreme and immediate danger.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on the school's motives and credibility, stating, “The school is backtracking and being deceptive to try and weasel out of this,” and asking the rhetorical question, “What do they have to hide?”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the implications of a calligraphy assignment, framing it as “forced Islamization,” “indoctrination,” and “proselytizing.” It simultaneously minimizes the stated educational purpose of the lesson within a world religions unit.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The line “This is in West Virginia, not Baghdad” is a direct appeal to patriotism and national identity, contrasting an American setting with a foreign one associated in the audience's mind with Islam and conflict.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words designed to provoke a reaction, such as “outrage,” “egregious submission,” “vicious and brutal ideology,” “weasel out,” and “dawah.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses the same technique by disapproving of the school's actions by linking them to groups the intended audience would hate: “the Hamas-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)” and “The Islamic Society of North America, a Muslim Brotherhood front group.”

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text claims the issue is widespread to encourage readers to join the opposition, using phrases like “it is common nationwide,” “it’s a national problem,” and citing an instance where “hundreds protested” a similar issue in Florida.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex issue of teaching world religions in a secular school to a single, sinister cause: a deliberate plot of “Islamization.” It asserts that “History lessons in Islam are dawah – proselytizing for Islam,” which is a gross oversimplification.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text creates a sense of a larger conspiracy through vague suggestions, such as mentioning threats from a student’s unidentified “‘adult friends’” and asking “What do they have to hide?” without providing specific evidence of a cover-up.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author presents herself and her own book as an authority on the topic, stating, “This is exactly what I warned about in my book, Stop the Islamization of America…”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either the school is engaged in a malicious plot of indoctrination, or it is not. It dismisses any defense from the school as deceptive, leaving no room for nuance, such as a poorly executed but well-intentioned lesson plan.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “This is in West Virginia, not Baghdad” is used to shut down any complex discussion about multicultural education. The sarcastic question “Or would that be ‘islamofauxbic’?” is used to preemptively dismiss any counter-argument about prejudice.

16. Red herring – Yes – The poll embedded in the text, “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?”, is entirely unrelated to the article's topic and serves only to distract and inject partisan politics.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text creates and attacks a straw man by framing the school’s action as an intentional effort to convert children to Islam (“proselytizing”). It then attacks this fabricated motive, rather than addressing the school's likely actual position that it was a secular academic exercise.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges the school with hypocrisy by quoting a parent who contrasts the treatment of Islam with that of other religions: “Notice no bible verses, no reciting the 10 commandments or the Lord’s prayer... as compared to the Islamic packet.”

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is an unambiguous piece of propaganda. It employs a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques, often multiple times and in a blatant manner. The article's entire structure is built not to inform, but to persuade the reader toward a specific, pre-determined conclusion by provoking fear, anger, and outrage. It takes a single, local incident and uses exaggeration, loaded language, and causal oversimplification to frame it as part of a sinister national conspiracy of "Islamization." The author cites her own book as an authority, links the issue to hated groups (Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood), and uses red herrings (the political poll) to create associations in the reader's mind. The stated purpose of the author's work ("A Practical Guide to the Resistance") confirms that the intent is not objective reporting but a call to action based on a one-sided and emotionally manipulative presentation of events.
