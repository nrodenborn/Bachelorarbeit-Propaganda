Here's the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by a verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels directly attacking Democrats (e.g., "crooks," "cheaters") are used in the core reporting.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed as slogans are used within the core article text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The opening line "Florida should be called and called now unless the GOP wants to Florida and Georgia stolen the way they are stealing House seats" instills fear that elections are being stolen.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The entire article casts doubt on the actions and integrity of the Florida Democratic Party ("caught altering," "deliberately altered," "ineptitude or deception").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes (Exaggeration) – The phrase "stealing House seats" is a strong, unproven accusation of deliberate theft, going beyond the specific allegation of altered dates on forms. The headline "Caught Altering Election Documents" also frames it dramatically.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeal to patriotism, national identity, or state pride is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like "stolen," "caught," "altered," "controversy," "transgressions," "mishandling," "ineptitude," "deception," "frustrate," "burden," and "deliberately altered" carry strong negative connotations and appeal to emotion.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not explicitly state that an idea is popular to encourage acceptance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The implication that altered dates on "cure affidavits" alone equates to "stealing House seats" or significantly changing election outcomes oversimplifies a complex electoral process and legal situation.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The article reports specific allegations, dates, and sources (Politico, DOS letter) with relative clarity, despite its bias.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The article relies heavily on the actions and statements of the Florida Department of State (DOS) and the involvement of federal prosecutors ("Federal Prosecutors Called In", "State officials turned over...") to validate the seriousness of the allegations.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The embedded poll "Do you agree with the call for a federal investigation? Yes No" presents only two options, ignoring potential nuances like "unsure," "need more information," or "investigate specific individuals, not the party."
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases specifically designed to shut down critical thought (e.g., "It's common sense," "America First," "End of story") are used.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The entire section about the Jim Acosta poll ("Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?") and the associated sign-up mechanism is completely irrelevant to the story about Florida election documents.
17. **Straw men** – No – The article reports on specific allegations made by officials. It doesn't attribute a significantly weaker or different argument to Democrats and then refute that.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The article focuses solely on the alleged actions of Florida Democrats; it does not accuse them of hypocrisy by pointing to similar actions by others.

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits significant propaganda elements. While it reports on a factual event (investigation into altered forms), its framing is heavily biased. Techniques like **Appeal to Fear** ("stolen"), **Loaded Language** ("caught," "deliberately altered," "stealing"), **Exaggeration** ("stealing House seats"), **Causal Oversimplification** (linking forms to stolen seats), **Repetition** (Acosta poll), **Red Herring** (Acosta poll/sign-up), **Appeal to Authority** (emphasis on prosecutors/DOS), **Doubt** (casting suspicion on Democrats), and **Black & White Fallacy** (poll) are used to portray Florida Democrats negatively and suggest deliberate, widespread wrongdoing impacting election results. The sensationalist headline and focus support a specific narrative. However, the inclusion of specific details, sources (Politico, DOS letter), and the acknowledgement that the impact is unclear ("these votes could not count," "hurt their own interests," "ineptitude or deception") prevents it from being purely fabricated propaganda. It mixes factual reporting with propagandistic framing and language.
