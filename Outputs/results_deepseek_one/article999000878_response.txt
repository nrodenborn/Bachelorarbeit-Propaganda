Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting label is applied to the subject of the propaganda (the lawsuit/CNN/Acosta). Terms like "tense incident" or "tussle" are descriptive, not inherently insulting labels.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrase is used as a rallying cry within the text itself. "Keep it up" is encouragement, not a slogan for a cause.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear against alternatives to support its position.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The text casts doubt on the White House's credibility/cooperation: "The network has reached out to the White House on the issue but has 'gotten no response'."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The description minimizes Trump's reaction ("rightfully losing his patients" [sic]) and potentially exaggerates Acosta's action ("forcefully push the female interns arm away").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged words are used: "vicious attacks," "threats," "forcefully push," "escorted from the room," "deserved to have his credentials revoked."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of the idea of suing or revoking the pass. The poll exists but isn't used to argue popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The conflict is presented with some context (the Q&A exchange, the mic incident), not reduced to one simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is relatively clear and direct about the events and claims.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Floyd Mayweather is cited as a constitutional lawyer to support the strength of CNN's potential lawsuit: "CNN would have a 'really strong lawsuit' if they chose to proceed."
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dilemma presenting only two extreme options is presented.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used that explicitly shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is," "trust the plan").
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the lawsuit, the incident, and the reactions. Mentioning Donaldson's past is contextual for why he might be asked for an affidavit, not an irrelevant distraction.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent an opposing argument to refute it.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions.

**Verdict – 35% –** The text exhibits several propaganda techniques (Repetition, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority), primarily in its descriptive language framing the incident (minimizing Trump's reaction, maximizing Acosta's action, using emotionally loaded terms) and structuring (repeating the poll question). It also casts doubt on the White House and uses an authority figure. However, a significant portion of the text reports factual developments (lawsuit consideration, Donaldson's statements, the White House announcement, the existence of the poll) and quotes without overt manipulation. The combination of factual reporting with biased framing and specific techniques suggests some propagandistic intent, but it falls short of being predominantly propaganda.
