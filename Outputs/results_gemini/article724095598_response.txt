1. Name calling – No – The text uses terms like "terrorist" and "ISIS," but these are used to describe the group allegedly involved, not as an ad hominem attack on a specific opponent of the argument.
2. Repetition – No – While the central idea of an ISIS connection is the focus, the text does not use the technique of repeating the same phrase or message over and over to enforce it.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases or slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text supports its idea by instilling fear of a "terrorist infiltration, through the southern border," a concept designed to frighten the audience into accepting the proposed connection.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to question the credibility of the official narrative of the Las Vegas shooting by presenting "secret intel" and "alternative media reports" as the real story.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the certainty of its claims by stating, "We also know that it is a conclusive fact that there was more than one shooter," which treats eyewitness accounts in a chaotic event as incontrovertible proof.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its claims.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the audience, such as "horrific Las Vegas Massacre," "shockingly claimed," and "fateful night."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest an idea is popular with a hated group to discredit it.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text appeals to popularity by stating its claims line up with "other alternative media reports" and that there are "literally dozens of eyewitnesses," suggesting that many people believe this, so the reader should too.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text provides a simple, singular cause ("terrorist infiltration") for a complex event whose motive has been officially declared unknown, thus oversimplifying the situation.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The central evidence is described as "‘secret intel’" and "what i believe to be credible evidence," which is deliberately vague and obscure, preventing any real scrutiny of the claim.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article's entire premise rests on the authority of a "Congressman" to lend credibility to the claims. It also cites "Fox News" and "Infowars" as authoritative sources for its audience.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present a stark "either/or" choice between two options. It presents its own theory as the truth while implicitly dismissing the official one.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like "Let’s face it" and "We also know that it is a conclusive fact" to present claims as undeniable and discourage the audience from applying critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the irrelevant detail about "Stephen Paddock’s girlfriend actually deleted her Facebook page" to create a general sense of suspicion and conspiracy that does not logically support the main claim of an ISIS infiltration.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent a specific counter-argument in order to refute it. It primarily presents its own case.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It is not a piece of objective journalism but an article constructed to persuade the reader of a specific conspiracy theory by bypassing rational analysis. The article employs a multitude of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. It builds its case on an "Appeal to authority" (a Congressman) and "Obfuscation" (vague "secret intel") to make the claim seem credible yet unverifiable. It then uses an "Appeal to fear" (terrorist infiltration) and "Loaded Language" (horrific, shockingly) to create an emotional response. To create a sense of validation, it uses the "Bandwagon" technique ("other alternative media reports," "dozens of eyewitnesses") and "Exaggeration" ("conclusive fact"). The entire argument is a "Causal Oversimplification" of a complex event. Finally, it uses "Thought-terminating clichés" ("Let's face it") and a "Red herring" (the girlfriend's Facebook page) to cement its narrative and distract from the lack of concrete, verifiable evidence. The combination of these techniques indicates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's perception rather than inform them.
