Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "his racist, anti-semite claims", "cracker state", "useful idiot".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, brief, memorable phrase is used as a slogan within the article text itself.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Implied fear that Gillum will deceive voters ("None of the programs... would happen", "kept confidential", "he isn't planning on delivering") and fear about gun rights ("Gillum... considers Americans as criminals").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "may have just been completely undercut", "Not that his racist, anti-semite claims... weren't enough" (implying they might be insincere or insufficient), questioning Gillum's honesty and intentions throughout.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: "completely undercut", "utter racism of Smith". Minimization: Downplaying the significance of the source (Project Veritas) by presenting its claims matter-of-factly.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national/group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "racist, anti-semite claims", "undercut", "confidential from the public", "cracker state", "crazy, crazy, crazies", "corruption", "not a lawful man", "criminals".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis or Hitler.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal based on the popularity of an idea or action.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – No complex event is reduced to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is accusatory but relatively direct in its claims; no deliberate obscurity.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Relies heavily on the authority of the undercover video from Project Veritas and the statements made by the staffers (Omar Smith, Adrian Young) as evidence against Gillum.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – No presentation of only two stark choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "crazy, crazy, crazies" (used to dismiss Gillum/progressives without analysis), "Good luck with that!" (dismisses the "appeal to white guilt" strategy).
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Introducing the unrelated issue of the migrant caravan poll distracts from the main topic about Gillum. Bringing up Claire McCaskill's corruption at the end is also irrelevant to Gillum.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – "Gillum... considers Americans as criminals who need to prove their innocence before obtaining a gun." This misrepresents typical gun control positions (like background checks or waiting periods) as presuming all Americans are criminals.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – While it contrasts Gillum's accusations of racism with Smith's remarks, it doesn't directly charge Gillum *with hypocrisy* by pointing to an equivalent action of his own regarding race. It accuses him of harboring a racist staffer, not being racist himself in a comparable way.

**Verdict – 90% –** This text is highly likely propaganda. It exhibits numerous propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority, Thought-terminating clichés, Red Herring, Straw Men) with the clear intent to discredit Andrew Gillum, his campaign, and his policies. The language is overwhelmingly negative and emotionally charged. It selectively presents information from a controversial source (Project Veritas) without critical context, frames staffer comments as definitive proof of Gillum's deception and radicalism, and employs inflammatory labels ("racist, anti-semite", "crazy, crazy, crazies", "cracker", "useful idiot", "not a lawful man"). The inclusion of an irrelevant poll and a reference to another politician's corruption further demonstrates an agenda beyond objective reporting. While based on real video footage, the presentation, framing, and language choices are designed to manipulate the reader's perception and evoke a strong negative reaction against Gillum.
