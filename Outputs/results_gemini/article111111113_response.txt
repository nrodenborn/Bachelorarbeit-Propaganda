1. Name calling – Yes – The text reports that ICE Director Thomas Homan referred to Garcia Zarate as "the alien" and that President Trump "villainized" him.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text states that "Trump frequently villainized Garcia Zarate and cited Steinle's death during his presidential campaign."
3. Slogans – Yes – The text includes a direct quote of a tweet from President Trump which ends with the slogan, "BUILD THE WALL!"
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text quotes ICE Director Thomas Homan's statement: "It is unconscionable that politicians across this country continue to endanger the lives of Americans with sanctuary policies..."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text quotes President Trump calling the verdict "a complete travesty of justice," which questions the credibility of the jury and the court system.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text reports that "Trump also falsely claimed on Twitter that Garcia Zarate had previously committed violent crimes," which is an exaggeration of his actual nonviolent criminal record.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text quotes the ICE Director's statement appealing to the safety of "the lives of Americans," which is an appeal to national identity and patriotism.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text quotes ICE Director Thomas Homan referring to Garcia Zarate as "the alien," which is an emotionally charged and dehumanizing term.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not contain any examples of an idea being disapproved by suggesting it is popular with a group like the Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is correct because it is popular. Instead, it outlines a conflict between different groups and viewpoints.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text describes the argument from "immigration hardliners, who argued that Steinle would still be alive were it not for an insecure border and lenient treatment toward suspected undocumented immigrants," which is a simple explanation for a complex event.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is not vague; it provides specific details, names, and quotes to clarify the situation. The arguments it reports are also direct, not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text notes that "President Donald Trump immediately seized on the verdict on Thursday as evidence of the perils of 'Illegal Immigration,'" using his position to lend weight to his argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text reports on the argument from "top conservatives and critics" who "pinned blame for Steinle's death on illegal immigration and insufficiently aggressive deportation policies," presenting the situation as a simple choice between sanctuary policies and public safety.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text quotes President Trump's tweet ending in "BUILD THE WALL!", a phrase used to short-circuit complex debate on immigration.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text reports that Trump shifted focus from the trial's specifics to "the weakly protected Obama border," introducing an irrelevant topic to attack a political opponent.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text shows that Trump's tweet attacks the verdict by focusing on a fabricated history of violent crime, thereby refuting an argument that was not central to the defense's actual, successful claim that the shooting was an accident.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text presents the criticism against San Francisco and then immediately counters it by stating, "But ICE has faced criticism of its own over not seeking a judicial warrant," which is a classic whataboutism tactic that deflects blame.

***

Verdict – 10% – The text itself is not propaganda; it is a piece of journalistic reporting *about* a situation that is rife with propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader by presenting the facts of the case, the different arguments made (defense vs. prosecution), the political fallout, and the various perspectives involved (Trump, ICE, the Steinle family). The text is analytical, not persuasive. It actively debunks propaganda rather than using it, for example, by fact-checking President Trump's tweet and clarifying that Garcia Zarate's prior convictions were nonviolent. The vast majority of the propaganda techniques identified are found within the direct quotes or reported actions of the political figures involved in the debate, not in the narrative voice of the article itself. The text's function is to expose and explain the propaganda being used by others, which is the opposite of being propaganda. The 10% likelihood acknowledges that any news report has inherent framing, but the overwhelming evidence indicates this is a work of journalism, not propaganda.
