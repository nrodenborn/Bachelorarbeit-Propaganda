### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: The text does not use insulting labels against its subject (Trump or Obama). It neutrally compares policies.

2. **Repetition** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation*: The poll repeats the question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" three times consecutively.

3. **Slogans** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Build the Wall") are used to oversimplify the argument.

4. **Appeal to fear** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: The text focuses on policy comparisons, not instilling fear about alternatives.

5. **Doubt** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: While Greenwald critiques media outrage, he does not explicitly question credibility (e.g., "Can we trust Obama?"). 

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: Policies (e.g., arming Ukraine, bombing Syria) are stated factually without hyperbolic language.

7. **Flag-Waving** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: No appeals to patriotism (e.g., "support our troops") or national identity.

8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation*: Terms like "leftwing media," "outrage," and "fascist" (referring to leaders) evoke negative emotions/stereotypes.

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No**  
   *Explanation*: No comparisons to Nazis or Hitler (e.g., no "Vichy"-style analogies).

10. **Bandwagon** – **No**  
    *Explanation*: No appeal to popularity (e.g., "Everyone agrees Trump is tougher").

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No**  
    *Explanation*: Complex U.S.-Russia relations are acknowledged; no single cause is blamed (e.g., "Obama caused Putin’s aggression").

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No**  
    *Explanation*: Greenwald’s arguments are specific (e.g., listing sanctions, arms shipments).

13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Relies on Glenn Greenwald’s expertise as a "leftwing journalist" to validate the argument.

14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No**  
    *Explanation*: Nuance is acknowledged (e.g., Trump’s affinity for authoritarian leaders is noted as a separate issue).

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No**  
    *Explanation*: No phrases like "It is what it is" to shut down debate.

16. **Red herring** – **No**  
    *Explanation*: The focus remains on Trump/Obama policies; no irrelevant distractions.

17. **Straw men** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Greenwald refutes the exaggerated claim that Trump is a "puppet of Putin" (a narrative he implies the media promotes).

18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Deflects criticism of Trump’s refusal to condemn Putin by noting he also doesn’t criticize Netanyahu, Saudi leaders, or Duterte.

### Verdict – 35% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text **exhibits elements of propaganda** but is primarily **argumentative journalism**. It uses Glenn Greenwald’s credibility (Appeal to Authority) to contrast Trump’s and Obama’s Russia policies, countering media narratives. Propaganda techniques are present:  
- **Loaded Language** ("fascist," "leftwing media") and **Straw Men** (refuting the "puppet" claim) frame the debate emotionally.  
- **Whataboutism** deflects criticism of Trump’s approach to Putin.  
- The **Repetition** in the poll is a manipulative engagement tactic.  
However, the core relies on **factual policy comparisons** (sanctions, Syria strikes), acknowledges nuance (Trump’s affinity for authoritarians), and avoids fear-mongering or oversimplification. The 35% likelihood reflects embedded persuasive techniques but stops short of systematic deception. The article’s goal is advocacy, not pure propaganda.
