### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, most notably appeal to fear, repetition, exaggeration, loaded language, and appeal to authority. These techniques are used to heighten the sense of urgency and danger regarding the plague outbreak, possibly to influence public perception and behavior. However, the text also provides factual information, cites credible sources, and does not employ some of the more manipulative or deceptive techniques (such as name calling, black & white fallacy, or red herrings). The presence of multiple fear-based and emotionally charged techniques suggests a strong likelihood of propaganda intent, but the inclusion of factual content and expert opinion tempers this assessment. Thus, the likelihood of the text being propaganda is assessed at 70%.
