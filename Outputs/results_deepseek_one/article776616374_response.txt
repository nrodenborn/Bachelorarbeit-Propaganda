Here's the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "de facto government employee" (referring to mainstream media), "flagrant lies," "fictitious creation."  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" repeated verbatim three times.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "Fake News" (used repeatedly as a memorable label).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings about "more staged events to pull us into war" and historical death tolls.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "If you are to believe the official story," "widely discredited official story," and repeated questioning of government/media credibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "Millions of Vietnamese" killed (historically debated; estimates are ~1-3 million total Vietnamese deaths, but phrasing implies direct causation). Minimizes media's later corrections.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No overt appeals to patriotism/national identity. Focuses on criticizing institutions.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Slaughtered," "fictitious creation," "flagrant lies," "tarnishing the reputation of a nation," "egregiously erred."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No Nazi/Vichy comparisons.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Cites "deluge of information," released transcripts, and Robert McNamara/Võ Nguyên Giáp to validate claims.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames Vietnam War escalation solely on media's "failure to question" and the Gulf of Tonkin lie, ignoring broader geopolitical factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct and specific.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Uses Robert McNamara, Võ Nguyên Giáp, and Col. Macgregor to bolster claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Portrays government/media as uniform liars vs. truth-tellers (TFTP, declassified documents).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "But it wasn’t true. At all." shuts down nuance about the incident's complexity.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The Kavanaugh poll distracts from the Gulf of Tonkin narrative.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Asserts media reported claims "without question" and with "exclusive reliance," ignoring documented skepticism (e.g., 2010 transcripts showing congressional doubts).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting critics.  

---

**Verdict – 80% –** The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements through its selective framing, emotionally charged language, repetition, oversimplification of causes, and reliance on fear appeals. While based on historical facts (e.g., the Gulf of Tonkin incident was indeed misrepresented), it omits counter-evidence (e.g., media did later investigate and correct narratives) and uses manipulative techniques to advance a specific anti-establishment agenda. The Kavanaugh poll insertion and "fake news" sloganeering further signal intent to sway opinion rather than provide balanced analysis. Its sourcing from the partisan outlet *The Free Thought Project* reinforces this bias. However, the core historical claims prevent a 100% rating, as not all content is fabricated.
