Based on the provided definitions and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "Illegals" (used repeatedly) is an insulting label applied to undocumented immigrants. Also implied in "most corrupt Democrat Politician" poll.
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively. "Illegals" is also repeated frequently.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "Simple immigration plan", "We want strong borders and we want no crime".
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "costs the American people lots of money", "open borders and they don’t care about crime", "America's tax dollars are not bound up in a worthless judicial process", "begs the question if any of them take the law seriously" instill fear about cost, crime, and lawlessness.
5.  **Doubt – No** – While credibility is implied to be lacking ("worthless judicial process", Democrats "don’t care"), no direct question is posed about the credibility of a specific person or thing.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration: "worthless judicial process", "Democrats want open borders". Minimization: "simple system that works", "walk them back over the border and make sure they keep walking" (minimizes the complexity and human aspects of immigration enforcement).
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – "costs the American people", "America's tax dollars", "It is time that Congress sure up things" appeal to patriotism and national interest.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "Illegals", "open borders", "don’t care about crime", "obsolete", "horrible", "worthless judicial process", "more amnesty" use emotionally charged words and stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No suggestion that the opposition's ideas are popular with groups hated by the audience (e.g., Nazis, terrorists).
10. **Bandwagon – No** – The text does not explicitly state or imply that the ideas are popular or that the reader should join the majority.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Attributes the complex problems of immigration and deportation delays primarily to "obsolete" and "horrible" laws and the judicial process, ignoring other systemic factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The language used is direct and forceful, not deliberately unclear or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Statements and proposals are repeatedly attributed to President Donald Trump ("Trump said", "Trump told reporters", "Trump ripped", "Trump then called", "Trump has inherited") using his position as authority.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – "We want strong borders and we want no crime. The Democrats want open borders and they don’t care about crime." Presents only two extreme, opposing options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "Simple system that works", "A nice simple system", "worthless judicial process", "begs the question" are phrases that shut down deeper analysis of the complexities involved.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – The embedded poll ("Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?") and the list of Democrat names are irrelevant material distracting from the main topic of immigration policy.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – "The Democrats want open borders and they don’t care about crime." This misrepresents typical Democratic immigration policy positions, which generally do not advocate for completely open borders or express indifference to crime.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The text does not charge opponents with hypocrisy by pointing to their own past actions or inconsistencies.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a wide array of techniques (Name-calling, Repetition, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Exaggeration/Minimization, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating clichés, Red Herring, and Straw Men) to promote a specific political agenda on immigration. Its primary purpose is not balanced information but persuasion through emotional appeals, oversimplification, demonization of opponents ("illegals," "open borders," "most corrupt Democrat"), and distraction (the poll). While it contains factual elements (e.g., reporting Trump's statements, the existence of deportation processes), these are framed entirely within a highly biased narrative designed to evoke fear, nationalistic sentiment, and opposition to Democrats and current immigration processes. The heavy reliance on multiple propaganda techniques leaves little room for objective reporting or nuanced discussion.
