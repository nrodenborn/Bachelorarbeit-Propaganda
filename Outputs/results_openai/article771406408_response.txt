Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and black & white fallacy. These techniques work together to create a narrative that questions the credibility of the authorities and suggests that they are complicit in allowing the killer to escape justice. The use of emotionally charged language and repetition of key ideas further strengthens the likelihood that the text is intended to influence the audience's perception of the situation, making it highly likely to be propaganda.
