Here's the analysis of the text using the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "This is a **disgrace**." (Labeling the situation as a disgrace attacks the Democrats/process).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" (Repeated verbatim three times in the poll question).
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, standalone memorable phrase used as a slogan within the article text itself.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "This massive Democrat voter fraud could be the **end of our free republic**." (Uses fear of the republic ending).
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Imagine the ones that we don’t." (Gillum quote used to imply widespread unknown fraud) and the implication throughout that Democratic actions are fraudulent without conclusive proof.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "massive Democrat voter fraud" (Exaggeration - scale implied is massive without evidence) and minimizing the Republican violation ("illegally Let People Vote Over Fax & Email" in a Republican county is presented, but the focus and outrage are directed almost exclusively at Democratic actions elsewhere).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "could be the end of **our free republic**" (Appeals to patriotism/love of republic).
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "disgrace", "massive Democrat voter fraud", "beating the war drums" (included quote), "outraged" (describing Gillum), "finding" (scare quotes implying fraud), "embarrassment to our County and to Democracy!" (included quote). Uses emotionally charged words.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No explicit appeal to the popularity of an idea.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – No complex event attributed to a single simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is opinionated but relatively direct in its accusations, not deliberately obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – No significant appeal to a specific authority figure's support as evidence for the core claims (quotes from Gillum/Trump are presented as statements from involved parties, not validating authorities).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – "Have you ever heard of a close election in which a recount and “found” ballots gave the Republican victory? Of course not." (Presents only two possibilities: Democrats commit fraud via recounts/found ballots to win, implying Republicans never do or benefit this way).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" or "that's just common sense" used to shut down thought.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The entire section about Jim Acosta's press pass poll ("Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" repeated 3x) is completely irrelevant to the story about Florida election procedures and alleged fraud. It distracts.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks actions it attributes to Democrats (marking ballots, finding boxes), but these are presented as the actual accusations, not misrepresentations of an opponent's weaker argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – "This happened in “heavily Republican Bay County,”... Meanwhile, Democrat election officials are marking ballots themselves..." (Immediately counters the report of a Republican official's illegal action by pivoting to accusations against Democrats, implying hypocrisy in their outrage - "Gillum is outraged" [about Republican action]..."Meanwhile" [Democrats are doing worse]).

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits numerous classic propaganda techniques. It uses **Name Calling** ("disgrace"), **Loaded Language** extensively, **Appeal to Fear** (end of the republic), **Repetition** (Acosta poll), **Doubt** (implying unknown fraud), **Exaggeration** ("massive fraud"), **Flag-Waving** (free republic), **Black & White Fallacy** (Republicans never benefit from recounts/found ballots), **Red Herring** (Acosta poll), and **Whataboutism** (countering Republican violation with Democratic accusations). While it reports some factual events (Bay County's illegal voting methods, Gillum's outrage, Trump's tweet), the framing, selective emphasis (downplaying the Republican violation while amplifying unproven Democratic ones), inflammatory language, and inclusion of irrelevant material are overwhelmingly geared towards promoting a specific, highly biased narrative (widespread Democratic voter fraud threatening democracy) and provoking an emotional response (outrage, fear) rather than providing balanced information. The high percentage reflects the density and deliberate use of these manipulative techniques.
