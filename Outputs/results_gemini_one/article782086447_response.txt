1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack its subjects, such as referring to McCarrick as a "serial predator" and a "pervert," and describing certain clergy as "wolves" who "tear apart the sheep of Christ’s flock."

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly states its central message that Pope Francis knew about McCarrick’s abuses and covered them up. For example: "accuses Pope Francis of covering for McCarrick," "the Pope learned about it from me on June 23, 2013 and continued to cover for him," and "He knew from at least June 23, 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator. Although he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end."

3. Slogans – No – The text is a long, detailed testimony and does not employ brief, memorable phrases as slogans to rally support. It quotes "Do not be afraid!" but as a religious exhortation, not a political slogan.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear for the future of the Church if the author's call to action is not heeded. Examples include: "free the Church from the fetid swamp into which she has fallen," and describing homosexual networks as strangling "innocent victims and priestly vocations, and... the entire Church."

5. Doubt – Yes – The text is fundamentally built on casting doubt on the credibility of Pope Francis and numerous high-ranking clergy. For example: "His recent statements that he knew nothing about it... are absolutely laughable. The Cardinal lies shamelessly," and "Regarding Cardinal Sean O’Malley, I would simply say that his latest statements on the McCarrick case are disconcerting, and have totally obscured his transparency and credibility."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to emphasize the scale of the crisis, such as "corruption has reached the very top of the Church’s hierarchy" and calling the pontificate "disastrous." It also reports McCarrick's alleged minimization of his actions: "...admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the shared identity and patriotism of Catholics. Examples include: "for the good of the Church and protection of the faithful," "we the Catholic faithful demand," and "Let us all renew faith in the Church our Mother: 'I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church!'"

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is saturated with emotionally charged words to provoke a strong reaction. Examples include: "horrendous crimes," "terribly disfigured," "abominable crimes," "fetid swamp," "wicked pact," and "conspiracy of silence."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of the "conspiracy of silence" by comparing it to a group hated by the audience. Example: "...a conspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the mafia."

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text appeals to the growing popularity of its viewpoint to encourage others to join. Example: "Now in the United States a chorus of voices is rising especially from the lay faithful, and has recently been joined by several bishops and priests, asking that all those who... should resign."

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for the complex crisis of clergy abuse. Example: "The deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated." This simplifies a multifaceted problem down to a single cause.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague insinuations to imply conspiracy without providing full details, confusing the audience. Examples: "He and the St. Gallen Group know exactly who they are," and "Others belonging to this current even reside at the Domus Sanctae Marthae."

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author bases the entire testimony on his own authority as a former Apostolic Nuncio. He also cites others to bolster his claims: "Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, then first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington... is ready to testify to it."

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a situation with only two options. By quoting Pope Francis, “If we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it,” the author frames the issue so that the reader must either agree with him and demand the Pope's resignation (opposing evil) or be guilty of tacitly feeding the evil.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text is a long and detailed argument intended to provoke critical thought and action, not shut it down with simplistic, clichéd phrases.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces related but distracting material to broaden the attack. The long, detailed accusations against Cardinal Maradiaga in Honduras, while related to church corruption, serve to distract from and buttress the central claim about Francis and McCarrick by piling on other scandals.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a distorted version of an opponent's argument. It characterizes Cardinal Cupich's argument as claiming the problem "is not homosexuality" but "clericalism," then "refutes" this simplified position with statistics about male victims, misrepresenting the more nuanced argument that the power structure of clericalism enables abuse.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses on direct accusations against its targets. It does not attempt to deflect criticism of the author or his allies by charging opponents with hypocrisy on unrelated matters.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a highly effective and deliberate piece of propaganda. While presented as a factual testimony, its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the audience towards a specific, radical action: the resignation of the Pope. It achieves this by employing a vast majority of the propaganda techniques listed.

The document masterfully weaves a narrative of good versus evil, using emotionally charged **Loaded Language** ("fetid swamp," "abominable crimes") and **Appeals to Fear** (the Church is being "strangled") to create a sense of extreme crisis. It systematically dismantles the credibility of its targets through constant **Doubt** ("The Cardinal lies shamelessly") and **Name Calling** ("serial predator").

It builds its own authority through a constant **Appeal to Authority** (the author's own former position) while creating an in-group for the reader to join through **Flag-Waving** (appealing to a shared Catholic identity) and a **Bandwagon** appeal ("a chorus of voices is rising"). Complex issues are reduced through **Causal Oversimplification** (blaming "homosexual networks") and a **Black & White Fallacy** (you are either with us opposing evil, or you are feeding it). The comparison of the Church's secrecy to the **Mafia** is a clear use of Reduction ad Hitlerum to associate the leadership with a hated group.

The sheer density and combination of these techniques, all aimed at a single persuasive goal, demonstrate that the text is not merely a statement of facts but a strategically constructed argument designed to manipulate emotion, shape perception, and incite action, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
