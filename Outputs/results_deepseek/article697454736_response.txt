**Propaganda Technique Analysis**  
1. **Name calling** – Yes – Ferrara calls Fastiggi's arguments "sophistical" and labels defenders of *Amoris Laetitia* as "foot soldiers of a Leviathan Church."

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Fastiggi shifts to questioning Ferrara's "standing in the Catholic Church" instead of addressing evidence.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Ferrara misrepresents Fastiggi's "move away from sin" as endorsing ongoing adultery.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy deflect criticism.  

---

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits significant propaganda elements, primarily through **emotional manipulation** (Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language), **rhetorical attacks** (Name Calling, Straw Men), and **persuasive tactics** (Repetition, Bandwagon, Appeal to Authority). Ferrara’s contributions lean heavily on alarmist language ("moral catastrophe," "public adulterers") and repetition to discredit opponents, while Fastiggi deflects via canonical threats ("schism") and ad hominem challenges to Ferrara’s credibility. Though framed as theological debate, the exchange prioritizes persuasion over dialectical resolution, using multiple techniques to delegitimize opposing views. The 15% non-propaganda reflects narrowly focused theological arguments (e.g., Fastiggi’s analysis of AL 303), but these are overshadowed by polemical strategies.
