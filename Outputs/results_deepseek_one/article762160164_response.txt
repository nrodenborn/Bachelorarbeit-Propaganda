### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Use of Techniques**: 13/18 techniques are present, including loaded language, name-calling, and repetition to vilify Obama.  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Language like "dirty deal," "disgraced," and "cover-up" incites anger while avoiding balanced context.  
3. **Distortion of Facts**:  
   - Omits that the license was **never used** (banks refused) and was legally issued.  
   - Ignores the nuclear deal’s context, portraying routine diplomacy as treasonous.  
4. **Unsubstantiated Claims**: Links to "Spygate" with zero evidence, using it as a red herring.  
5. **Sarcasm & Repetition**: The "scandal-free" refrain discredits opponents without engagement.  
6. **Partisan Framing**: Uses "Obama Inc." and "Republicans revealed" to signal ideological bias.  

**Conclusion**: The text cherry-picks facts, uses inflammatory rhetoric, and employs multiple persuasion techniques to delegitimize the Obama administration, aligning with propaganda’s core function: advancing a narrative through emotional coercion rather than reasoned discourse. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the factual basis of the license’s existence, though its presentation is heavily distorted.
