### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Examples: "evil and apostate men" (referring to German bishops), "wolves," "rotten thing," "grotesquely corrupt Fr. Maciel," "homosexualist cabal."  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on "New Paradigm" (e.g., "McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm," "going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction").  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "What’s Your Trade?" (title), "state of emergency," "Deposit of the Faith."  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings that priests face homelessness, unemployment, and blacklisting if they oppose corruption (e.g., "a bishop can... render a priest homeless, penniless and jobless").  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions the credibility of bishops (e.g., "even the 'good bishops' have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out," "bishops won’t protect and support good priests?").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: "nearly the entire episcopate of the United States either colluded directly or kept quiet." Minimization: Downplays bishops' responses as "lame whitewashing attempt."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to Catholic identity and tradition (e.g., "preserving the precious treasure... the sacramental life," "authentic Catholic life").  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotionally charged terms like "predatory gay priests," "ravening eyes," "toxic emission," "blackmailing culture," "purge."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No direct comparison to Hitler/Nazis. References to "cabal" imply conspiracy but lack explicit Hitler parallels.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Cites Rod Dreher, Steve Skojec, and John Zmirak to validate claims (e.g., "Dreher is doing excellent work," "Zmirak suggested...").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames all crises on a single "homosexualist cabal" (e.g., "the result of a mass-collusion," "the wolves are now looking... at the faithful").  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are direct; no deliberate ambiguity.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Uses Rod Dreher, Steve Skojec, and Henry Sire as sources (e.g., "As Dreher reported," "historian Henry Sire documented").  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents a binary: "faithful" vs. "corrupt" clergy (e.g., "They are, in short, our enemies," "wolves").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Phrases like "state of emergency" and "New Paradigm" shut down nuance (e.g., "certain norms are naturally suspended" in emergencies).  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – All examples tie back to the central critique of Church corruption.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Criticizes actual positions (e.g., bishops' defense of "a few bad apples").  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No deflection via accusations of hypocrisy.

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs **14/18 techniques** to advance a highly partisan narrative:  
1. **Agenda-Driven Framing**: Portrays the Catholic Church as systemically corrupt due to a "homosexualist cabal," dismissing institutional reforms or nuanced analysis.  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses fear (priests facing destitution), outrage ("life-long homosexual rapist"), and urgency ("final slide," "state of emergency") to rally readers against Church leadership.  
3. **Dichotomous Rhetoric**: Divides actors into "faithful" vs. "evil" camps, delegitimizing dissent (e.g., bishops are "wolves" or "enemies of Christ").  
4. **Selective Evidence**: Cites sympathetic sources (Dreher, Sire) while ignoring counter-narratives or Church responses.  
5. **Call to Action**: Urges financial separatism (e.g., "escrow funds," buying convents) and frames lay defiance as necessary for survival, implicitly endorsing schism.  
While based on real scandals (McCarrick), the text’s one-sided demonization, oversimplified causality, and relentless emotional appeals prioritize persuasion over balanced discourse. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the underlying factual basis of clergy abuse scandals, but the presentation is unequivocally propagandistic.
