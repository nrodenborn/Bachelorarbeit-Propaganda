Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text labels Omar Smith's statements as "racist statements" and accuses the campaign of "lying to voters." It also quotes Smith using the racial slur "cracker state."
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The headline "Caught on video: Gillum staffer makes racist statements and admits campaign is lying to voters" is repeated verbatim at the start of the article. The phrase "that will never happen" is repeated regarding Gillum's promises.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable, slogan-like phrases are used to encapsulate the message beyond the repeated headline, which functions more as a label/repetition.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text instills fear that voters are being deliberately deceived ("admits campaign is lying to voters", "admitting they are lies") about policies and that the candidate holds extreme views ("part of the crazy crazy crazies").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text explicitly questions Gillum's credibility and honesty throughout ("admits campaign is lying", "admitting they are lies", "lying to Florida voters"). The final questions ("Will there be wall-to-wall coverage...?", "Will Gillum be asked to denounce...?") further cast doubt on media fairness and Gillum's response.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: The word "eviscerating" in "wall-to-wall coverage in the media eviscerating Gillum" is hyperbolic and exaggerated. Labeling Smith's views as "part of the crazy crazy crazies" is also exaggerated.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not appeal to patriotism, national identity, or a specific group identity like "We the People" beyond the context of Florida voters.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Highly charged, negative words are used throughout: "racist statements", "lying", "f***ed up", "cracker state" (racial slur), "whip them up into a frenzy", "crazy crazy crazies", "eviscerating", "demean".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally hated groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not argue that Gillum's actions should be condemned because it's popular to do so or that others are doing it. It focuses on the specific allegations.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text actually provides a specific reason (Republican-controlled legislature) why Gillum's promises might not happen, rather than oversimplifying the cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is direct and clear in its accusations (lying, racism). It quotes specific examples and provides specific policy promises.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text relies heavily on the undercover video ("Caught on video", "video evidence confirms") and the statement from Project Veritas Action President James O'Keefe ("“What we found... was... a candidate lying...”) as authoritative proof of its claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: The text acknowledges the political reality (Democratic governor, Republican legislature) that prevents Gillum's promises, showing complexity rather than presenting only two simplistic choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: The text doesn't use simplistic phrases to shut down discussion; it presents evidence (video quotes) to support its claims and ends with questions prompting further scrutiny.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the allegations stemming from the undercover video (lies, racism, strategy) and doesn't introduce irrelevant topics to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text quotes Omar Smith and Adrian Young directly and criticizes them based on those specific statements. It doesn't misrepresent or refute an argument they didn't make.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text focuses solely on the allegations against Gillum and his staffers. It does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing opponents (e.g., Republicans) of hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits strong characteristics of propaganda. Its primary purpose is to discredit Andrew Gillum and his campaign using selectively presented, damaging footage obtained via a sting operation. It employs multiple propaganda techniques effectively:
*   **Name-calling** ("racist," "lying," "crazy crazies") and **Loaded Language** ("f***ed up," "cracker state," "whip them up into a frenzy," "eviscerating") create a highly negative emotional response.
*   **Repetition** of the core accusation reinforces the message.
*   **Appeal to Fear** is used by emphasizing deliberate deception of voters.
*   **Doubt** is systematically sown about Gillum's honesty, campaign strategy, and media coverage.
*   **Exaggeration** intensifies the criticism ("eviscerating," "crazy crazy crazies").
*   **Appeal to Authority** relies heavily on the Project Veritas video and its president as the sole source of truth.
While the text is *based* on real video footage (the core "evidence"), the framing, selective quoting, sensationalist and emotionally charged language, clear intent to harm a political opponent, and origin from a known partisan actor (Project Veritas) firmly place it within the realm of propaganda. It presents a one-sided, inflammatory narrative designed to provoke outrage rather than provide balanced reporting. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of actual quotes, but the overall presentation is overwhelmingly propagandistic.
