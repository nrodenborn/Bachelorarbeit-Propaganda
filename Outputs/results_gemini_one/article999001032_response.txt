1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes a campaign staffer describing Gillum as being part of "the crazy, crazy, crazies." It also quotes a staffer describing Florida as a "cracker state."
2. Repetition – Yes – The central message that Gillum is making "empty promises" that he "can't keep" is repeated throughout the text in headlines, summaries, and direct quotes. For example: "Gillum Makes Promises He Can’t Keep," "Empty Promises Exposed," and "Smith reveals Gillum cannot fulfill his campaign promises."
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases as headlines to frame the narrative, such as "Empty Promises Exposed," "Deceiving Voters," and "Secret Gun Control Agenda Revealed."
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The section titled "Secret Gun Control Agenda Revealed" is designed to instill fear in voters, particularly gun owners, by suggesting the candidate has a hidden plan to ban certain firearms. Example: "I don’t think he can say it [be]cause he’s trying to get the moderates."
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to cast doubt on Andrew Gillum's credibility and honesty. The headline "Gillum Makes Promises He Can’t Keep" and the quote "That’s not for [voters] to know" directly question his integrity.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggerated language to describe Gillum's political position and his campaign's strategy. Example: "He is a part of the crazy, crazy, crazies" and the strategy to "whip them up into a frenzy."
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism or national/state identity to support its own position. It attacks the Gillum campaign for allegedly using identity politics ("appeal to white guilt") but does not use the technique itself.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to evoke a negative reaction. Examples include "frenzy," "F***ed up," "cracker state," "deceiving," and "crazy, crazy, crazies."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups to discredit Gillum or his ideas.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text attempts to create a sense of a widespread movement of discovery by stating, "What we found in the Gillum campaign was just what we found in Missouri, Tennessee and Arizona, a candidate lying to the voters." This suggests a pattern that the reader should also recognize and join in condemning.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simplified reason for why Gillum's platform cannot be enacted: "Democratic governor, Republican legislature." This is used to "prove" he is lying, oversimplifying the complex realities of political negotiation, compromise, and public pressure.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text's method is the opposite of vague; it uses specific (though selectively edited) quotes to make very direct and clear accusations against the candidate.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents James O’Keefe, "founder and president of Project Veritas Action," as an authority on uncovering political secrets, lending credibility to the findings. It also quotes a "Broward County Commissioner" as an insider with authoritative knowledge.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The article presents a binary choice: Gillum is either the moderate he publicly portrays himself as, or he is the secret, "crazy" progressive that the video supposedly reveals him to be, leaving no room for political nuance.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text highlights a cynical phrase used by a staffer to dismiss all of Gillum's promises without critical thought: "Remember our saying, modern day fairy tales start with ‘once I am elected.'"
16. Red herring – No – The article is highly focused on its goal of discrediting Andrew Gillum and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the audience from its main point.
17. Straw men – Yes – The article constructs a "secret agenda" for Gillum based on the opinions and speculations of staffers, then attacks this constructed agenda as if it were Gillum's stated policy. Example: "Secret Gun Control Agenda Revealed" is based on a staffer saying, "I don’t think he can say it."
18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses exclusively on attacking Andrew Gillum and does not attempt to deflect criticism by pointing out hypocrisy or wrongdoing in others.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the audience to adopt a negative view of a political candidate by employing a very high number of propaganda techniques. The article is framed as a "breaking news story" and an "undercover video report" to give it a veneer of journalistic legitimacy. However, its content is meticulously curated to achieve a political objective. It relies heavily on emotionally loaded language ("frenzy," "crazy"), name-calling, and creating doubt about the candidate's character. The information is presented through selectively edited clips and quotes from staffers, which are then used to build a straw man argument about the candidate's "secret agenda." This agenda is then used to appeal to fear (especially regarding gun control). The entire piece is an exercise in framing a narrative through techniques like repetition of a core negative message ("empty promises"), the use of slogans as headlines, and appealing to the authority of the organization's founder. The sheer density of these techniques, combined with the stated goal of exposing "secrets and lies" from a specific political target, moves the text far from objective reporting and firmly into the realm of propaganda.
