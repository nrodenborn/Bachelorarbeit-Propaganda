3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs multiple techniques—including **name-calling**, **appeal to fear**, **doubt**, **minimization**, **flag-waving**, **loaded language**, **appeal to authority**, **red herring**, and **whataboutism**—to discredit Christine Ford, defend Kavanaugh, and attack Democrats. The framing is highly partisan: Ford is labeled a political operative, allegations are dismissed as a "set-up," and Democratic motives are portrayed as "nefarious." The selective focus on uncorroborated details while ignoring broader #MeToo context, coupled with false equivalencies to unrelated cases (Clinton, Trump), demonstrates a clear agenda to manipulate perception rather than engage in balanced discourse. The only minor restraint is the absence of absolute false dichotomies (black/white fallacy) or overt thought-terminating clichés.
