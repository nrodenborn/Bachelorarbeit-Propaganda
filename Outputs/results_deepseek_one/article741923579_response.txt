Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "deep, deep corruption" (referring to the FBI), "willful ignorance" (referring to authorities/FBI).
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – While themes like "mystery," "global jihad," and FBI denial are repeated, there isn't a specific, identical phrase repeated verbatim for emphasis like the definition requires.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable, rallying phrase is used (e.g., "Build the Wall").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "If the jihadis advance even into the FBI’s Sacramento offices, will agents there be struggling to determine the jihadis’ motive even as the machete begins to slice through their necks?" (Uses graphic imagery to instill fear about the consequences of the FBI's perceived inaction).
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "given the FBI’s recent track record of denial and deception, they may still be searching for Kazi’s motive" (Questions the FBI's credibility and honesty).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "deep, deep corruption" (Exaggerates the FBI's failings). Also minimizes potential alternative explanations like mental health issues by mocking them ("mental health issues among the German High Command").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While the text mentions a war and military targets, it doesn't explicitly appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its point.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Numerous examples: "screaming 'Allahu akbar'", "comic opera", "astronomical and catastrophic", "global jihad", "willful ignorance", "deep, deep corruption". These words/phrases carry strong negative connotations and stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – "It’s as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier who crashed through the Ardennes Forest... to see if each one’s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler’s war aims." and "Sean Ragan might explain to us that authorities are also trying to determine whether the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 was motivated by Nazism, or by mental health issues..." (Uses Nazi Germany comparisons to disapprove of the FBI's investigation methods and imply they are absurdly ignoring an obvious enemy).
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text doesn't argue that an idea should be accepted because it's popular.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes the FBI's difficulty finding a motive *solely* to their refusal to acknowledge "global jihad" and Islam's connection to terrorism ("The FBI doesn’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism... So each time something like this happens, they’re back at Square One"). It ignores complex factors like evidentiary thresholds, investigative procedures, or the possibility of other motives.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and assertions, not deliberately vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – While the author (Robert Spencer) is named and his credentials listed, the arguments within the text itself are not primarily supported by appeals to his or others' authority. The arguments stand on their own logic (flawed as it may be).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as only two possibilities: either the attack was motivated by Islamic jihad (the obvious truth the FBI ignores) OR the FBI is corrupt/willfully ignorant. It dismisses other potential motives or complexities ("Authorities are also investigating whether or not Kazi was suffering from any mental health issues. Here again, this is just more of the general refusal to acknowledge the 800-pound gorilla...").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Phrases like "deep, deep corruption", "willful ignorance", and "800-pound gorilla" are used to dismiss the FBI's investigation and alternative explanations without engaging critically with them.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on the event, the FBI's response, and the author's critique of both. It doesn't introduce obviously irrelevant material to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – "The FBI doesn’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism." This misrepresents the FBI's stated position ("We don’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point") which is a specific finding on *this case based on current evidence*, not a blanket denial of the existence of global jihad or any connection between Islam and terrorism. The author refutes this exaggerated position.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text doesn't charge its opponents (the FBI) with hypocrisy by pointing to their own past actions or inconsistencies. The Nazi Germany comparisons are analogies to criticize current actions, not accusations of hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of recognized propaganda techniques. It heavily employs **Loaded Language** and **Name Calling** to vilify the FBI ("corruption," "ignorance"). It uses **Appeal to Fear** with graphic hypotheticals. It **Exaggerates** the FBI's failings while **Minimizing** alternative explanations. It relies on **Causal Oversimplification** and the **Black & White Fallacy** to frame the event and the FBI's response. It employs **Reduction ad Hitlerum** (Nazi comparisons) to discredit the investigation. It uses **Thought-Terminating Clichés** to shut down debate. It constructs a **Straw Man** representation of the FBI's position. The core argument – that the FBI is willfully ignoring an obvious Islamic terrorist motive due to political correctness or corruption – is driven by these techniques rather than a balanced presentation of facts. The author's affiliation (Jihad Watch) and the polemical, accusatory tone further signal a propagandistic intent to promote a specific narrative about Islam, terrorism, and government incompetence. While it discusses a real event, the interpretation and presentation are overwhelmingly manipulative.
