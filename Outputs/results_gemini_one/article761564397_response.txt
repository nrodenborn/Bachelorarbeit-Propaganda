Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack opponents. It criticizes their actions and alleged motivations but refrains from direct name-calling.

Repetition – Yes – The idea that there is a different standard of justice for people like Saucier versus elites like Hillary Clinton is repeated throughout the text. Examples include: "he was subject to unequal protection of the law," "chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton," "they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton," and "there’s a two-tier justice system."

Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries.

Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses on alleged past injustices and does not attempt to instill fear about future consequences or alternative ideas.

Doubt – Yes – The entire premise of the lawsuit is to cast doubt on the credibility and fairness of the Obama administration, the Department of Justice, and former FBI Director James Comey. Example: Saucier’s quote, “They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal... but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Saucier minimizes his actions by stating he "only wanted service mementos" and wanted to show the photos "only to his family," while the text notes prosecutors argued he "put national security at risk."

Flag-Waving – No – While the subject is a former Navy sailor, the text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism to support its claims.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the audience's perception. Examples include "unequal protection," "lenient," "walking free," and the concept of a "two-tier justice system."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular. While it mentions Trump's support, it's framed as an appeal to authority, not popularity.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Saucier presents a simple cause for his complex legal situation. Example: “They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text and the claims within it are presented with clarity, not deliberate vagueness.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses President Trump's position and actions to lend credibility to Saucier's claims of being treated unfairly. Example: "While campaigning, and after taking office, Trump frequently voiced support for Saucier, who in March became the second person he pardoned."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text, through Saucier and his lawyer, presents the situation as a binary choice between a fair system and a corrupt "two-tier justice system," ignoring the legal complexities and nuances that differentiate the Saucier and Clinton cases.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion. It makes arguments, even if they are fallacious.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the case of Hillary Clinton to distract from the specifics of Saucier's own admitted guilt. The final paragraphs about Dinesh D'Souza also serve as a red herring, broadening the argument to a general pattern of unfairness rather than focusing on the facts of Saucier's case.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an opponent's argument that was not actually made. It focuses on presenting its own argument.

Whataboutism – Yes – This is the central technique used. Saucier's entire argument deflects from his own actions by charging the Obama administration with hypocrisy. Example: "Trump often compared the Obama administration’s handling of Saucier’s case with that of Clinton."

Verdict – 85% – While this text is structured as a news report, it functions as a powerful piece of propaganda. It almost exclusively presents the viewpoint of Kristian Saucier and his supporters, framing his narrative through a multitude of propaganda techniques. The core of the article is built on Whataboutism, constantly deflecting from Saucier's admitted crimes by raising questions about Hillary Clinton. This is supported by a Black & White Fallacy (the "two-tier justice system"), Loaded Language to evoke a sense of injustice, an Appeal to the Authority of President Trump to validate the claims, and Causal Oversimplification to explain Saucier's prosecution. The article gives minimal space to the prosecution's viewpoint and concludes by introducing the Dinesh D'Souza case as a Red Herring to reinforce the broader political narrative of partisan persecution. Therefore, despite its journalistic format, the text's overwhelming one-sidedness and heavy reliance on these techniques make it a highly effective vehicle for propaganda.
