Here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in "The Coming Coup" text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "presstitutes" (used to insult the media).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "military/security complex" is repeated numerous times (e.g., "The military/security complex...", "The complex and its...", "The military/security complex orchestrated...").
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable catchphrase is used.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings of nuclear war ("dangers of tensions between nuclear powers"), dystopia ("America will be a complete dystopia"), and retribution against supporters ("will experience retribution once Trump is removed").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions the legitimacy of Russiagate ("a proven hoax, but believed by many due to its endless repetition") and implies the media/politicians are controlled ("the media and politicians that the complex owns").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates the control and omnipotence of the "military/security complex" (orchestrating Russiagate, arrests, assassinations, coups) and minimizes other factors in historical events (e.g., simplifying JFK's assassination solely to peace efforts).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While patriotism is implied by accusing others of treason/sedition, the text itself doesn't explicitly appeal to patriotism or national identity as a primary technique.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Highly charged terms like "presstitutes," "treason," "sedition," "hoax," "orchestrated," "coup," "dystopia," "retribution," "stone wall," "war or surrender" are used to evoke strong negative emotions.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Hitler or the Nazis is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to the popularity of an idea is present.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes complex historical events (JFK assassination, Watergate, Russiagate, tensions with Russia) solely to the actions of the "military/security complex," ignoring other contributing factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The message is presented quite directly and bluntly, not vaguely.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites President Eisenhower's warning as definitive proof ("Truer words were never spoken by an American president").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents limited options: For Putin/Lavrov, only "war or surrender"; for America under the coup, only "complete dystopia"; implies the "military/security complex" is the sole cause of all problems.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases specifically designed to shut down critical thought are used.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on its core narrative about the "military/security complex" and its alleged coup.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks positions it attributes to the "complex" (e.g., opposing normalization with Russia, viewing peace efforts as treason), but doesn't significantly misrepresent them beyond its core narrative.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Does not charge opponents with hypocrisy as a distraction.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is to persuade the reader of a specific, highly charged narrative: that a monolithic "military/security complex" is orchestrating a coup against Trump to maintain its budget by demonizing Russia, using tactics like fabricated scandals (Russiagate), controlling media ("presstitutes"), and even assassinations. This narrative is advanced through:
*   **Repetition** of the key term "military/security complex".
*   **Name-calling** ("presstitutes").
*   **Appeal to fear** (nuclear war, dystopia, retribution).
*   **Doubt** cast on official narratives (Russiagate as a "hoax").
*   **Exaggeration** of the complex's power and reach (controlling everything, orchestrating major historical events).
*   **Causal Oversimplification** (attributing JFK's death, Watergate, etc., solely to the complex).
*   **Loaded Language** ("treason," "sedition," "coup," "dystopia").
*   **Appeal to Authority** (Eisenhower's warning).
*   **Black & White Fallacy** (presenting extreme, limited options).

The text presents this narrative as established fact with minimal evidence beyond assertion and historical reinterpretation favoring its thesis. It demonizes opponents (media, politicians not aligned with Trump, the complex itself) and frames Trump as a victim of treasonous forces for pursuing peace. While it contains elements of political commentary, its overwhelming reliance on emotionally manipulative language, simplification, repetition, and fear-mongering to promote a specific, conspiratorial viewpoint marks it overwhelmingly as propaganda. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the *potential* for interpreting it as extreme opinion, but its methods align overwhelmingly with propaganda techniques.
