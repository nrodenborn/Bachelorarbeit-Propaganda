1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the actions it describes as "stealth proselytizing," which is an insulting label suggesting deception and religious conversion efforts.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times in a row. Additionally, the central theme of Islam receiving preferential and proselytizing treatment in schools is repeated through numerous anecdotal examples from different states.
3. Slogans – Yes – The title itself, "The Islamization of the Public Schools," functions as a brief, memorable, and impactful phrase that frames the entire article.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text aims to instill fear by suggesting a widespread conspiracy to "indoctrinate our impressionable high-schoolers," referencing materials that praise the "slaughtering" of Christians and Jews, and framing school lessons as a threat to children's faith.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text consistently questions the credibility and stated motives of school officials. For example, a parent's reaction to a calligraphy exercise ("Their excuse was calligraphy. I was like, ‘Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!’") is used to cast doubt on the school's official explanation.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by claiming the issue is "nationwide" based on a handful of anecdotes. It also minimizes the teaching of other religions, with one parent claiming the class "spent much less time on Christianity and Judaism than it did on Islam."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to an American identity by framing the issue as a threat to "American public schools" and contrasting the treatment of Islam with the historical role of Christianity in American society, specifically mentioning the ACLU and the Supreme Court.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases such as "Islamization," "whitewashes its violent history," "intolerant doctrines," "stealth proselytizing," "gruesome detail," and "indoctrinate" to create a strong negative emotional response.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by suggesting it is popular with Nazis or other similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea should be adopted because it is popular. It argues the opposite, suggesting a negative trend is becoming widespread and must be resisted.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex issue of curriculum development to a single, simple cause: a commitment to "multiculturalism," which it claims has "rob[bed] many educators of their ability to evaluate non-Western cultures critically."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague generalizations like "all too many public schools" without providing comprehensive data. The final line, "Unfortunately, in the end, it amounts to the same thing," is intentionally vague and ominous.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from a "Judicial Watch Senior Investigator" and the "chairman of Citizens for National Security" as authorities to lend credibility to its argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false choice, particularly in the conclusion: "Multiculturalism, after all, amounts to respect for every culture except one’s own." This frames the situation as a choice between embracing a negatively-defined multiculturalism or defending one's own culture.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The statement "Multiculturalism, after all, amounts to respect for every culture except one’s own" is a simplistic, dismissive phrase designed to shut down nuanced discussion on the topic.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll asking "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is a blatant red herring, as it is completely irrelevant to the article's topic of religion in schools and serves only to distract and engage the audience on a different political front.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text creates a straw man of multiculturalism by defining it in an overly simplistic and negative way ("embarrassment, regret, and even self-hatred") that makes it easy to attack, rather than engaging with the actual, more complex concept.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text's primary method is direct attack, not deflecting criticism of its own side by pointing to an opponent's hypocrisy.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and comprehensive example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint through emotional manipulation. It employs a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques, including loaded language ("Islamization," "indoctrinate"), appeal to fear (of children being converted), and causal oversimplification (blaming "multiculturalism" for a perceived conspiracy). The article builds its case on a series of emotionally charged anecdotes rather than objective, comprehensive data, presenting them as evidence of a "nationwide" problem. It exclusively presents sources and voices that support its narrative while dismissing or ignoring counterarguments. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring poll further demonstrates that the article's intent is not journalistic integrity but political persuasion and audience manipulation. The cumulative effect of these techniques is a one-sided, emotionally driven polemic designed to provoke outrage and shut down critical thought.
