---

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques, including **name-calling** ("lying"), **repetition** (poll question), **slogans** ("Don’t allow yourself to be deceived"), **doubt** (questioning the cleric’s honesty), **exaggeration/minimization** (downplaying Islamic tolerance while amplifying violence), **loaded language** (emotive descriptors like "wholesale slaughter"), and **appeal to authority** (self-citation and historical sources). Its core purpose is to discredit the cleric and promote a specific narrative (and the author’s book), using one-sided historical examples without contextual balance. The embedded poll and call-to-action ("Preorder...") further signal persuasive intent. While based on factual events, the selective framing, emotional appeals, and promotional goals align strongly with propaganda objectives.
