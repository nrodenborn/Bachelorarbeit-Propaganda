Based on the definitions provided and the text "ICE Deports Guatemalan Man Wanted For Assassination", here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – The text uses the legal charges ("wanted for assassination", "accused of fatally shooting") and descriptive terms ("foreign fugitive", "threat to public safety") based on official statements or charges, not purely insulting labels.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message (deportation of a specific fugitive) is stated clearly but not repeated excessively within the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed for persuasion are used. The quotes are statements, not slogans.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the individual is described as a threat and his alleged crime is serious, the text does not attempt to instill fear about other alternatives or broader consequences to support an idea.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of anyone or anything. It presents information from authorities (Guatemalan law enforcement, ICE) as factual.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The information presented (charges, timeline, statistics) appears factual and proportional. There's no obvious inflation or downplaying of facts.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – The text mentions cooperation between the US and Guatemala but does not explicitly appeal to patriotism or national identity to persuade.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Phrases like "foreign fugitives trying to escape law enforcement" and "a threat to public safety" carry strong negative connotations and appeal to emotions (fear, outrage) beyond a purely neutral description. The term "assassination" (while potentially the legal term) also carries heavier weight than "murder".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There is no attempt to link the deportee, his actions, or critics to universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – While statistics are given ("removed more than 1,700 foreign fugitives", "240,255 removals nationwide", "Ninety-two percent... convicted"), they are presented as context or evidence of ICE activity, not primarily to argue that deportation is popular or the "thing to do".
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text reports a specific deportation based on a specific crime and legal process. It doesn't attribute complex societal issues to simple causes like immigration.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is relatively clear and specific about the who, what, when, where, and why of this specific deportation and the broader statistics provided.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text relies heavily on statements from authorities (Guatemalan authorities, a federal immigration judge, ICE Field Office Director Ricardo Wong) and their pronouncements (charges, removal order, priority statement, threat assessment) as evidence supporting the narrative and actions of ICE. The statistics also function as an appeal to the authority of ICE's data.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text focuses on reporting a single deportation case and providing context through statistics. It does not present a complex issue with only two extreme choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases like "it is what it is" or "common sense" used to shut down discussion. The quotes are specific statements.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the deportation of Ohajacao-Ramos, the charges against him, the process, and ICE's broader mission/statistics related to similar cases. It doesn't introduce irrelevant topics.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text reports actions and statements; it does not set up and refute an opposing argument that wasn't actually made.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge critics or opponents with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated issues.

**Verdict – 15% – Explanation:**
The text is primarily a straightforward news report detailing a specific deportation case, supported by factual details (timeline, location, legal status, charges) and contextual statistics. The core function is informational. However, elements of **Loaded Language** ("foreign fugitives trying to escape," "threat to public safety," the impactful use of "assassination") and **Appeal to Authority** (relying heavily on official statements from ICE and Guatemalan authorities to frame the narrative positively) introduce a subtle persuasive layer. This serves to legitimize ICE's actions and mission, framing the deportation as unquestionably necessary and beneficial for public safety. While present, these techniques are not overwhelmingly dominant. The bulk of the text remains factual reporting. Therefore, while it has propagandistic *elements* favoring ICE's perspective, it does not cross the threshold into being primarily propaganda itself. The likelihood is judged as low (15%) because the persuasive techniques are secondary to the core informational purpose.
