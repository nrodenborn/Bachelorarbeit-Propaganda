Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "far-left Democrat operative" (used to attack Christine Ford's credibility with a negative label).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No significant repetition of phrases or ideas beyond standard rhetorical emphasis.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Build the Wall") used for persuasion.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "There is no low to which the Democrats will not sink to attain their nefarious goals" (implies Democrats pose an extreme threat to America).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Repeatedly questions Ford's account: "unprovable accusation," "uncorroborated," "memory of the event may be suspect," "discrepancies."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes the allegation: "unprovable accusation from decades ago," while exaggerating Democratic motives: "nefarious goals."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "stopping the President from strengthening America and protecting Americans" (frames opposition as anti-American).  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "nefarious goals," "set-up," "far-left Democrat operative" (emotionally charged, negative terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis or hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames Democrats alone for the controversy: "designed to derail the nomination," ignoring complexities of the allegation.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct, not deliberately obscure.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites David French/National Review analysis to validate skepticism.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Title implies Democrats *only* believe women when accusations target Republicans (ignoring nuance).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "This is clearly a set-up" (shuts down critical examination of Ford’s claims).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Shifts focus to Clinton/Trump/Moore allegations (irrelevant to Kavanaugh’s specific case).  
17. **Straw men** – No – The text summarizes French’s argument without misrepresentation.  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Title and Clinton/Trump comparisons ("I have the same standard...") accuse Democrats of hypocrisy.  

---

**Verdict – 95%** – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs numerous techniques: **Name-calling** ("far-left Democrat operative"), **Loaded Language** ("nefarious," "set-up"), **Appeal to Fear** (Democrats sinking to dangerous lows), and **Doubt** (undermining Ford’s credibility). It distracts via **Whataboutism** (Clinton/Trump accusations) and **Red Herring**, while using **Black & White Fallacy** to oversimplify Democratic motives. The **Appeal to Authority** (French/National Review) lends false legitimacy, and **Thought-terminating clichés** ("clearly a set-up") deter scrutiny. Though it incorporates a sourced analysis, this is weaponized selectively to support a preexisting narrative. The core purpose is not balanced discourse but to discredit opponents, manipulate emotions, and delegitimize the allegation against Kavanaugh—classic propaganda objectives.
