1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses an insulting label in one of the poll options to attack Jim Acosta: "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass."
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the same poll question three times in a row: "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?"
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text quotes CNN using this technique to argue its case: "If left unchallenged, the actions of the White house would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions Jim Acosta's credibility by presenting the author's interpretation of a video as fact over Acosta's own account: "Acosta can deny how the altercation took place, but the video shows the facts, which are that Acosta was out of line."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the physical contact by describing it as Acosta "forcefully pushing her arm away," which frames the interaction as more aggressive than a simple refusal to yield a microphone.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to create a negative impression of Acosta, such as "altercation," "argumentative," and "forcefully pushing."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The poll itself is a form of bandwagon appeal, creating a mechanism for readers to see a (potentially manipulated) consensus and encouraging them to join it.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex situation by attributing the revoking of the press pass solely to Acosta's behavior during the press conference ("placing his hands on a young woman"), ignoring the long history of conflict between the administration and the reporter/network.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text's bias is clear, and it does not rely on intentionally vague or obscure language to make its point.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents the White House's position as authoritative fact while framing CNN's position as a mere claim. For example: "Acosta can deny how the altercation took place, but the video shows the facts, which are that Acosta was out of line."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents only two meaningful choices, one of which is loaded to frame the opposition negatively: "Yes, he should have gotten it back" versus "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass." This ignores any nuanced positions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "the video shows the facts" is used to end debate and dismiss any other interpretation of the event, discouraging further critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text's heavy focus on the physical interaction with the intern is a red herring that distracts from the central First Amendment question of whether a president can ban a reporter for asking challenging questions.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not invent a false argument to attack. It reports on the existing arguments, albeit with a strong bias.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse an opponent of hypocrisy to deflect from the issue at hand.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a neutral news report but an opinion piece designed to persuade the reader to take the side of the Trump administration against CNN and Jim Acosta. The piece employs a multitude of propaganda techniques to achieve this. The most blatant evidence is the poll, which uses repetition, name-calling, a black & white fallacy, and loaded language ("act like a child") to frame the issue and manipulate the reader. Furthermore, the author uses techniques like appeal to authority and thought-terminating clichés ("the video shows the facts") to present their biased interpretation as objective reality while casting doubt on the opposing view. The use of a red herring (focusing on the physical contact) distracts from the core constitutional issues of the lawsuit. The combination of these techniques creates a heavily one-sided narrative that demonizes the subject (Acosta) and aims to solidify a particular viewpoint rather than inform the reader.
