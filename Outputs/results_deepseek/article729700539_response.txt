Here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against any subject or object.  
2. **Repetition** – No – Key points (e.g., the cooling effect being minor) are stated but not excessively repeated.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to persuade (e.g., "grand minimum" is a scientific term, not a slogan).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – While global warming’s "negative effects" are mentioned, fear is not used to promote an alternative idea. The text emphasizes the sun’s cooling *won’t* counteract warming.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility occurs; scientists and their study are presented authoritatively.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Specific, measured language is used (e.g., "0.25%," "several tenths of a degree"). Risks/impacts are not inflated or downplayed.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty.  
8. **Loaded Language** – No – Language is neutral and technical (e.g., "ultraviolet radiation," "greenhouse gas"). No emotionally charged words or stereotypes.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association of ideas with hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on the popularity of the study’s conclusions to sway opinion.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text explicitly rejects oversimplification, noting solar cooling alone cannot offset CO2-driven warming.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are clear and precise (e.g., "6.9 percent cooler," "400 parts per million"). No ambiguous phrasing.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Scientists and their study are cited appropriately as sources, not as unquestionable authorities. The focus remains on evidence/data.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dilemma is presented; nuances (e.g., partial mitigation vs. full solution) are acknowledged.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases that shut down discussion (e.g., "it is what it is"). Explanations invite further research.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All content is relevant to the study’s findings and implications. No irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments; the text addresses actual climate mechanisms.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy or deflection to other issues.  

---

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is a straightforward, evidence-based report on a scientific study. It presents specific data (e.g., "0.25% cooling," "400 parts per million CO2"), attributes claims to researchers, and includes qualifying statements (e.g., solar cooling "is not sufficient to stop global warming"). There is no emotional manipulation, partisan framing, or distortion of facts. The 5% uncertainty stems solely from the source (PressTV, which has propaganda tendencies), but the *content itself* shows no hallmarks of propaganda. It aligns with scientific communication, emphasizing peer-reviewed findings and contextual limitations.
