Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **No** – While strong language is used (e.g., "sophistical," "Pharisees," "literal-mindedness"), these are criticisms of arguments or attitudes, not direct insulting labels applied to the *subject* of the propaganda (the opposing view on AL) itself.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – While core arguments are reiterated (e.g., Fastiggi defends the orthodox interpretation of AL 303, Ferrara insists Francis approves communion for public adulterers), the same specific phrase or message isn't repeated verbatim throughout.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable, rallying phrases are used in this text segment.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – Ferrara warns of a "moral catastrophe" and "bimillenial discipline... being overthrown," which highlights consequences, but the primary technique is argumentation against AL, not instilling fear of alternatives *to support* his own view.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Ferrara repeatedly casts doubt on Fastiggi's understanding and motives: "his superficial and I must say entirely sophistical attempt," "Fastiggi has succumbed to an unfortunate literal-mindedness," "demonstrate a pronounced lack of comprehension," "a rather embarrassing lack of rhetorical finesse."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Ferrara minimizes the evidence Fastiggi presents (Argentine bishops, Schoenborn) as "very thin evidence" and exaggerates the implications of Fastiggi's position: "defending Amoris Laetitia at the very moment it is being cited by bishop after bishop as their sole authority for admitting public adulterers to Holy Communion".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Both sides appeal to Catholic identity and loyalty. Fastiggi questions Ferrara's standing ("refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff," "schism," "standing in the Catholic Church"). Ferrara invokes traditional authority ("bimillenial discipline," "John Paul," "moral norm").
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotionally charged language is frequent: "sophistical," "verbal artifice," "moral catastrophe," "grave problems," "intensifies them," "Pharisees and legalists," "public adulterers," "bimillenial discipline... being overthrown," "clumsy and insulting questions," "embarrassing lack," "Leviathan Church," "Immortal God in heaven," "false witness."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Ferrara appeals to the authority and number of critics to bolster his position against Fastiggi: "Tell that to the four cardinals, the 800,000 faithful, the 45 theologians and the 61 other original signers of the correctio".
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The arguments presented, while contested, acknowledge complexity (e.g., discussions of conscience, gradualness, interpretation of texts) rather than attributing outcomes to a single simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Both sides attempt to clarify their positions and interpretations. Fastiggi specifically tries to define "generous response." The disagreement is about interpretation, not deliberate obscurity.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Both sides cite authorities to support their views. Fastiggi cites Buttiglione, Müller, the Catechism, Canon Law, and Pope Francis's explanations. Ferrara cites John Paul II, Familiaris Consortio, the Filial Correction signatories, and appeals to "bimillenial discipline."
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – While the debate is polarized, both sides acknowledge nuances within their positions (e.g., Fastiggi discusses the "law of gradualness," Ferrara distinguishes between continence and ongoing adultery). Neither presents *only* two absolute options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – The text is characterized by extended arguments and rebuttals, not phrases designed to shut down discussion. Phrases like "It’s really just the opposite" or "self-evidently underway" are argumentative conclusions, not clichés terminating thought.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The points raised, even when challenging the opponent's standing (Fastiggi on schism, Ferrara on comprehension), are directly related to the core disagreement over AL's interpretation and authority, not clearly irrelevant distractions.
17. **Straw men** – **Possible, but weak** – Both accuse the other of misrepresentation. Ferrara claims Fastiggi "pretend[s]" and misrepresents Francis's intent. Fastiggi suggests Ferrara misunderstands AL 303. While each believes the other misrepresents their view, specific, clear-cut examples of refuting a completely unstated argument are not prominent.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Neither diverts criticism by charging the other with hypocrisy unrelated to the core issue of AL interpretation. Criticisms are focused on the arguments and interpretations presented.

**Verdict – 80% –** The text exhibits a high degree of propagandistic elements. While it presents substantive theological arguments, the pervasive use of **Loaded Language** (highly emotional and accusatory terms like "sophistical," "moral catastrophe," "Pharisees," "public adulterers," "Leviathan"), **Appeal to Authority** (citing various figures and traditions to legitimize positions), **Bandwagon** (Ferrara invoking the numbers of critics), **Doubt** (undermining the opponent's credibility and understanding), **Exaggeration/Minimization** (downplaying evidence, amplifying consequences), and **Flag-Waving** (appeals to Catholic loyalty, tradition, and implied threats to standing within the Church) strongly indicates an intent to persuade through emotional manipulation, credibility attacks, and tribal loyalty rather than purely rational discourse. The core disagreement is genuine, but the *manner* of argumentation leans heavily on propaganda techniques to discredit the opposition and rally support.
