### Verdict – 5% –   
**Explanation**: The text is a straightforward news report recounting a tragic event using verified sources (police reports, 911 recordings, official statements). It avoids emotional manipulation, loaded language, or persuasive framing. Key indicators of propaganda—such as appeals to emotion, selective omission, or rhetorical techniques to sway opinion—are absent. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges that *any* media involves inherent framing (e.g., highlighting officers' heroism by noting their immediate shooting upon entry), but this falls within standard journalistic practice rather than propagandistic intent. The article prioritizes factual chronology over ideology.
