Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used to attack the subject (Ebola outbreak, DR Congo, or responders).
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed for persuasion are used.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the dangers of Ebola are stated (e.g., "has a case fatality rate of 50%", "the dangers of a wider outbreak were apparent in 2014"), this is presented factually as context. The text does not primarily use fear to support a specific idea or action against alternatives.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person, organization, or information related to the outbreak or response.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The statistics and descriptions ("17 dead", "ninth Ebola outbreak", "case fatality rate of 50%", "typically records low fatalities") appear factual and proportional. Nothing is obviously inflated or downplayed for persuasive effect.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity to support an idea.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is generally neutral and descriptive (e.g., "outbreak", "confirmed", "dispatched", "experimental vaccine", "contained"). No emotionally charged words or obvious stereotypes are used to manipulate.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No idea is disapproved by associating it with a hated group.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea to encourage acceptance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text states facts about the outbreak and response without attributing complex events to a single, simple cause. It acknowledges multiple factors like location ("remote villages"), medical experience, and public awareness.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific about numbers, locations, timelines, actions taken, and facts ("17 people have died in Bikoro", "ninth Ebola outbreak", "WHO... dispatched a team... released $1 million", "case fatality rate of 50%", "two 21-day incubation cycles").
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While the WHO and DR Congo health ministry are cited as sources of information and action ("DR Congo’s health ministry now says", "WHO... has dispatched... released $1 million"), this is presented as reporting factual developments, not primarily using their authority as evidence to support a specific claim beyond the facts themselves.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents a factual situation and historical context. It does not frame choices or outcomes in a simplistic "either/or" manner.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used that clearly aim to shut down critical thought or discussion (e.g., "it is what it is", "that's just common sense").
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the Ebola outbreak in DR Congo, its context, and the response. The mention of the 2014 West Africa outbreak is relevant context for understanding potential dangers, not an irrelevant distraction.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not present or refute any arguments not actually made by an opponent.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse any opponent or critic of hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 10% –** The text reads overwhelmingly as a factual news report. It presents specific details (numbers, locations, timelines), cites sources (DRC Health Ministry, WHO), provides relevant context (history of outbreaks, 2014 epidemic), and describes actions being taken without employing persuasive language, emotional manipulation, logical fallacies, or the specific propaganda techniques listed. The 10% acknowledges that *any* selection and presentation of facts involves framing, but here the framing appears neutral and informative rather than deliberately manipulative or agenda-driven. The primary purpose seems to be informing the audience about a current event, not persuading them to adopt a specific viewpoint or action beyond basic awareness.
