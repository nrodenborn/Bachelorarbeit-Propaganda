Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "malicious agenda" (describing the Left's actions), "wild claims" (describing Ford's accusations), "social justice warrior-lawyers" (describing Ford's legal team), "loon", "lunacy", "unbalanced" (describing Ford), "loonier" (describing Ford's lawyer).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: Repeatedly questioning Ford's credibility and mental state ("never-credible", "weak and ridiculous", "loon", "lunacy", "unbalanced", "believing something that isn’t real").
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases used repeatedly as slogans (e.g., "Build the Wall").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to take control from Republicans." (Fear of Democrats gaining control and blocking the nominee indefinitely). Also implied fear of the Supreme Court being "shorthanded" and ideologically deadlocked.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Relentlessly casting doubt on Ford's accusations and credibility: "never-credible", "weak and ridiculous", "wild claims", "fake emergencies", "not possible", "arbitrary", "utter nonsense", "doesn’t want to testify", "look like the loon she is", "signs of lunacy", "believing something that isn’t real", "lawyer is even loonier", "unbalanced", "destroying herself".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: *Exaggeration:* "hurl the wild claims like a grenade", "blow up the process", "torpedo President Trump’s agenda". *Minimization:* "as weak and ridiculous as they are", "drunken groping", "non-federal matter", "hasn’t even been clearly outlined", "nothing to investigate".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: No direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Numerous emotionally charged words and phrases: "malicious agenda", "block the nominee", "deliberately refused", "rational discussion", "wild claims", "grenade", "blow up", "game the system", "masters of delay", "social justice warrior-lawyers", "torpedo", "fake emergencies", "utter nonsense", "loon", "lunacy", "loonier", "unbalanced", "destroying herself", "high-stakes behind-the-scenes jockeying".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Hitler or Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: No appeal to the popularity of an idea or action.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: While complex events are described (the confirmation battle), no single, overly simple cause is attributed to them.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is direct and opinionated, not intentionally vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Cites "former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova" calling the demand for an FBI probe "utter nonsense" and making claims about Ford and her lawyer, using his position to bolster the argument against Ford.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents the situation as Democrats maliciously trying to "blow up the process" and delay indefinitely vs. Republicans/Kavanaugh seeking a fair and timely hearing to "clear his name". Implies the only reason for delay is bad faith.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: No phrases like "it is what it is" or "that's just how it works" used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the confirmation process, the allegations, and the actions of the parties involved. While biased, it doesn't introduce completely irrelevant material.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: Portrays the Democrats/Ford's team's actions and demands solely as a deliberate, malicious strategy to cause maximum disruption and delay ("hurl the wild claims like a grenade", "blow up the process", "masters of delay", "social justice warrior-lawyers hoping to torpedo", "clearly a desire to delay proceedings"), dismissing legitimate concerns about investigation and testimony conditions as mere tactics.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: Does not charge opponents with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions (e.g., "What about Bill Clinton?").

**Verdict – 85% – Explanation:** The text exhibits a very high concentration of propaganda techniques, particularly Name Calling, Repetition (of attacks on credibility), Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, and Straw Men. Its primary purpose is not to neutrally inform but to aggressively persuade the reader that Christine Blasey Ford's accusations are entirely without merit and part of a malicious Democratic plot to sabotage Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation. It achieves this by relentlessly attacking Ford's character, credibility, and mental state, dismissing her claims as ridiculous, attributing sinister motives to her and her lawyers, and framing the situation in starkly partisan terms. While it reports some factual developments (e.g., hearing scheduling, Kavanaugh's willingness to testify, Ford's conditions, threats to family), these are embedded within and framed by the overwhelming use of manipulative techniques designed to evoke outrage and dismiss the opposition's position outright. The overwhelming bias and consistent use of techniques designed to manipulate opinion rather than foster critical evaluation place it firmly in the realm of propaganda.
