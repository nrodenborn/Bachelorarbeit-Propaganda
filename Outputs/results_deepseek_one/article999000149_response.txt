Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "poisonous lies" (directly attacking Omar's statements with an insulting label).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, brief, memorable phrase is used as a slogan within the article text itself (though the quoted tweet "#Gaza #Palestine #Israel" uses hashtags, these aren't a slogan within the article's argument).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Linking Omar's tweet to the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre ("especially after the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre") uses a recent tragedy to instill fear about the consequences of her election.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Retailing these poisonous lies ought to hurt her chances for election to Congress..." casts doubt on her fitness for office and the validity of her statements.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "the Left is increasingly anti-Semitic" is a broad, exaggerated generalization about a large political group.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national/group identity is made within the article's argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "poisonous lies", "evil doings", "hypnotized the world", "hateful sad man" are emotionally charged words appealing to strong negative emotions and stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis, Hitler, or groups hated by the audience (like the Vichy example) is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to the popularity of an idea or action is made.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – No complex event is reduced to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The language used is direct and accusatory, not deliberately obscure or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – While sources like the Jewish Virtual Library and ADL are cited for factual context, the article's core arguments (e.g., calling her lies "poisonous", labeling the Left anti-Semitic) are not primarily supported by appeals to authority figures.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – "But she is a Leftist, and the Left is increasingly anti-Semitic, so she will cruise to victory" presents a simplistic binary: Leftist = Anti-Semitic = Will Win, ignoring nuance or other factors.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases used clearly shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is", "that's just common sense").
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The repeated poll about using military force against a migrant caravan is completely irrelevant to the main topic of Ilhan Omar's tweet about Israel and accusations of anti-Semitism. It distracts the reader.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The article quotes Omar's arguments ("Drawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating Jews") and criticizes them directly, but doesn't significantly misrepresent or refute an argument she didn't make. Its core attack is on the *nature* of her criticism ("poisonous lies").
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The article does not charge Omar or her defenders with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated wrongs committed by others.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques designed to discredit Ilhan Omar and associate her with anti-Semitism. Key indicators include:
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** Extensive use of *Name Calling* ("poisonous lies") and *Loaded Language* ("evil doings", "hypnotized") to evoke strong negative feelings.
*   **Distortion:** *Exaggeration/Minimization* (labeling the entire Left as increasingly anti-Semitic) and *Black & White Fallacy* (simplifying her election chances solely to her being a Leftist anti-Semite).
*   **Distraction:** A clear *Red Herring* (the repeated, irrelevant migrant caravan poll) diverts attention.
*   **Fear & Doubt:** *Appeal to Fear* (linking her to the synagogue massacre) and *Doubt* (questioning her electability based on her statements) are employed.
*   **Repetition:** The poll repetition serves to hammer home an unrelated point.
While the article includes factual context about the 2012 conflict and cites sources, its framing, selective emphasis, and the techniques listed above are overwhelmingly geared towards promoting a specific, hostile narrative about Omar and the Left, rather than providing a neutral analysis. The presence of the blatantly irrelevant poll strongly signals an intent beyond simple reporting.
