Name calling – No – The text uses factual or legal terms like "suspect" and "convicted of burglary" rather than insulting labels.
Repetition – No – The article presents a sequence of events and new information, not a repeated message.
Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases designed to be repeated or to encapsulate an idea.
Appeal to fear – No – While the events described are frightening, the text does not use this fear to support a specific idea or argue against an alternative. The fear is inherent to the event being reported, not a tool of persuasion.
Doubt – No – The text reports information from official sources like police and 911 calls without questioning their credibility.
Exaggeration/minimization – No – The reporting appears to be factual and avoids hyperbole or downplaying the severity of the events.
Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
Loaded Language – No – The text uses neutral, descriptive language (e.g., "shot dead," "responded to a 911 hangup call"). Emotional content comes from direct quotes ("Please help, please help") rather than the author's word choice.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to hated groups.
Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular or that the reader should agree with it because others do.
Causal Oversimplification – No – The text provides multiple points of context (domestic violence history, prior conviction, illegal firearm possession) rather than assigning a single, simple cause for the event.
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear. It explicitly states when information is not available ("Police have not released many details"), which is a feature of factual reporting, not obfuscation.
Appeal to authority – No – The text cites authorities like the police and public records as sources of information, which is standard journalistic practice for attribution, not a fallacious appeal to authority to prove a point.
Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present a limited set of options to the reader.
Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases or clichés intended to stop critical thought.
Red herring – No – All the information presented, such as the history of domestic violence calls and the suspect's criminal record, is directly relevant to the reported incident.
Straw men – No – The text is a factual report and does not construct or refute any arguments.
Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing others of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 0% – This text is a news report, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the public about a specific event, not to persuade the audience to adopt a particular belief or take a specific action (other than the commercial call to subscribe). The language is objective and factual, attributing information to specific sources like 911 audio, police departments, and public records. It avoids all the listed propaganda techniques, instead presenting a factual account with relevant context. Propaganda aims to manipulate emotions and distort information to push an agenda, whereas this text aims to report facts as they are known.
