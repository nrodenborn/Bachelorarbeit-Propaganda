Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Gillum is labeled as part of the "crazy, crazy, crazies" and his campaign strategy is described as "deceiving voters" and making "empty promises". Florida is also called a "cracker state".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "that will never happen" is repeated multiple times regarding Gillum's platform promises (raise corporate tax, raise teacher's pay, Medicare for all).
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrase designed for recall is used as a central slogan in the text itself. The headline uses "Empty Promises Exposed" and "Deceiving Voters", but these are descriptive labels rather than campaign-style slogans.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text suggests voters are being deliberately deceived ("That’s not for [voters] to know"), that the campaign aims to "whip" voters "into a frenzy", and that Gillum has a hidden "Secret Gun Control Agenda". This instills fear about the candidate's honesty, intentions, and policies.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The entire text is structured to cast doubt on Gillum's honesty, credibility, and true intentions (e.g., "Gillum campaign makes promises it knows it can’t keep", "Deceiving Voters", "Secret Gun Control Agenda Revealed", questioning if he believes his own campaign values).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Labeling Florida as a "F***ed up," "cracker state" is a clear exaggeration/minimization. Describing Gillum's promises as "fairy tales" and him as part of the "crazy, crazy, crazies" minimizes/exaggerates his positions and credibility.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: There is no direct appeal to patriotism or a specific national/group identity to support the argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Numerous emotionally charged or stereotypical terms are used: "Empty Promises Exposed", "Deceiving Voters", "fairy tales", "whip 'em up", "frenzy", "f***ed up", "cracker state", "white guilt", "crazy, crazy, crazies", "socialist", "way out of left field", "Secret Gun Control Agenda".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparison to Hitler, Nazis, or universally hated groups is made to disapprove of Gillum or his policies.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: There is no appeal to the popularity of the idea that Gillum is deceptive or his policies are bad.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text attributes Gillum's inability to fulfill promises primarily to Republican control of the legislature, which, while potentially oversimplified in the broader context of governance, isn't presented as the *sole* cause for a complex event in the manner defined.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is direct and accusatory, not deliberately vague or confusing. The claims are stated explicitly.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text heavily relies on the undercover videos and statements from Project Veritas Action (James O'Keefe) and campaign staffers (Omar Smith, Cliff Eserman, Dale Holeness, Adrian Young) as authoritative proof of its claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text implicitly frames the situation as Gillum either being honest about his electable positions (which it suggests he doesn't truly hold) or deceitfully promising things he can't deliver to win votes. It presents the "true" Gillum as a far-left progressive/socialist hiding his agenda, ignoring nuance or middle ground.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: While terms like "crazy, crazy, crazies" or "socialist" could be dismissive, they are not used as phrases specifically designed to *terminate* critical thought within the argument presented. They are used as descriptors.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the allegations against Gillum and his campaign staff. It doesn't introduce obviously irrelevant material to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text attacks statements and views attributed to Gillum and his staff via the undercover video. It doesn't appear to misrepresent a specific opposing argument not made. (Though the *selective editing* of undercover video is a known Project Veritas tactic that can create straw men, the *text itself* reports on the content presented in that video without obviously refuting an argument Gillum publicly made).
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not charge Gillum or his staff with hypocrisy by pointing to actions of others (e.g., "What about when X did Y?"). It focuses solely on their alleged actions and statements.

**Verdict – 90% – Explanation:** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy). Its core purpose is not balanced reporting but to aggressively discredit Andrew Gillum and his campaign using selectively presented undercover footage and inflammatory language. It originates from Project Veritas Action, an organization known for its partisan undercover operations targeting progressive figures. The sensationalist headlines ("Empty Promises Exposed", "Deceiving Voters", "Secret Gun Control Agenda Revealed"), reliance on potentially manipulated covert recordings, heavy use of emotionally loaded terms, and one-sided framing designed to instill distrust and fear overwhelmingly indicate this is propaganda aimed at influencing voters against Gillum. While it contains factual elements (e.g., quotes from individuals, the existence of the video), its presentation and intent align strongly with propaganda. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges the *potential* that the underlying video evidence, however selectively edited, might contain some truth, but the *text's* construction is undeniably propagandistic.
