1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels when it quotes the title of a book, referring to the papacy as “The Dictator Pope” and describing it as “the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of recent history.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes that the people receiving communion are in a state of “adultery” or “objective mortal sin,” reinforcing the author's judgment of the situation. The idea that the Pope’s action is illegitimate is also repeated using different terms like “heresy,” “sacrilege,” and “counter-magisterial.”

3. Slogans – No – The text uses strong quotes and phrases, but it does not employ brief, original, and memorable slogans to encapsulate its message.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting a catastrophic outcome for the Church, stating that if the Pope were to declare his interpretation "ex-cathedra," "the Mystical Body would then be without its head," and that a heretical pope would "cease, by that act, to be the Pope."

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is designed to cast doubt on the legitimacy and authority of the Pope's actions, explicitly calling the promulgation "counter-magisterial" and stating that "heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by quoting a description of the papacy as "the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of recent history."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the religious identity of its target audience by framing the issue as a defense of the true Catholic faith. It states that "the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration," appealing to their identity as faithful Catholics.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words intended to sway the reader, such as "objective mortal sin," "adulterous couples," "heresy," "sacrilege," "dissenting left," and "tyrannical."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, this technique is used by disapproving of the Pope's idea by suggesting it is popular with a group hated by the target audience: "the pope and his right-hand man now feel they have enough support from the dissenting left that enables them to come forward with it."

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. In fact, it argues against a decision being made by the highest authority in the Church, positioning itself as a form of resistance.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the Pope's motivation for his action by attributing it to a single cause: having "enough support from the dissenting left," ignoring any complex theological or pastoral reasoning.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's position and argument are presented with stark clarity and directness, not vagueness.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text selectively uses authorities that support its argument against the Pope, citing "St. Thomas Aquinas," "Cardinal Raymond Burke," and canonist "Franz Wernz" to lend credibility to its position of resistance.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice with no room for nuance. The Pope's declaration is either legitimate Magisterium (which the author rejects) or it is "heresy or sacrilege" that must be resisted, ignoring any other possible interpretations or pastoral considerations.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down debate; rather, it uses detailed, albeit one-sided, arguments to provoke thought in a specific direction.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the book "The Dictator Pope" and a quote about "Four years of Bergoglio." This serves to distract from the specific theological points of the papal letter and shifts the focus to a broader character attack on Pope Francis as a political manipulator.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified version of the Pope's position. By quoting the Pope saying, "There are no other interpretations," it frames the guidelines as a rigid, absolute decree, making it easier to attack as a heresy, rather than as a pastoral guideline for "complex circumstances."

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to excuse one wrong by pointing to another or charge the Pope with hypocrisy in that manner. It directly attacks the Pope's action as being fundamentally wrong.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its purpose is not to inform a reader about a development in the Catholic Church in a neutral manner, but to persuade the reader that the Pope's action is illegitimate, heretical, and a danger to the faith. It achieves this by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. The piece systematically uses loaded language, name-calling, and exaggeration to create a strong negative emotional bias against Pope Francis. It constructs a black-and-white fallacy, presenting the situation as a choice between faithfulness and heresy, and uses an appeal to fear by warning of the catastrophic consequence of the Pope ceasing to be the head of the Church. The argument is bolstered by a selective appeal to authority (citing figures who support the author's view) while simultaneously seeking to undermine the primary authority of the Pope. Logical fallacies such as causal oversimplification, red herring, and straw man are used to misrepresent the Pope's motivations and arguments, making them easier to attack. The sheer number and consistent application of these techniques indicate a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's opinion and incite resistance, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
