Here is the analysis of the text against the defined propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "left-wing media", "hysteria of the left", "intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times consecutively. Also, the core message "Trump has been tougher on Russia than Obama" is repeated throughout.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – While phrases like "focus on the actions" are used, there isn't a distinct, brief, memorable phrase acting as a slogan central to the message.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – References to "Russian meddling in 2016", "Putin's attempts at expanding his influence", "Russian aggression", "Russia's aggressive behavior", and "diplomatic isolation" imply dangers that Trump's policies are supposedly countering, while criticizing those who question Trump.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "The very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump... are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016." and "the very intensity and nastiness... is an attempt to distract attention from their failure" directly question the credibility and motives of critics (Brennan, Clapper, the media).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Calling Obama's response to Ukraine "weakness on a pathetic scale" minimizes/denigrates Obama's actions. Calling media criticism "constant hand-wringing" and "hysteria" minimizes/ridicules opposing viewpoints. Describing Trump's actions as "far tougher... than President Obama ever dreamed of being" exaggerates the contrast.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "It was their duty in 2016 – not candidate Trump’s" appeals to patriotic duty. "Protect America", "weakening Russia", "force Putin to change his aggressive behavior", "stronger NATO", and framing policies as making Russia's life difficult appeal to patriotism and national security.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "silly", "hand-wringing", "hysteria", "nastiness", "pathetic scale", "mole", "aggressive behavior", "weakening Russia", "firm", "intellectually honest" are emotionally charged words used to evoke specific reactions (ridicule opponents, praise Trump, instill concern about Russia).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – The text does not attempt to link opponents or their ideas to universally hated groups (like Nazis) to disapprove of them.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – While citing Hemingway and Gingrich, the text doesn't primarily argue that Trump's stance is *correct* because it's popular; it argues based on actions and contrasts with Obama.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Implies that actions like sanctions, expelling diplomats, and selling weapons to Ukraine are the *simple cause* for being "tough on Russia" and countering its influence, without acknowledging potential complexities or counter-effects.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is relatively direct in its accusations and defenses, listing specific actions. While some claims are broad (e.g., "far tougher"), they are not deliberately obscure or vague in expression.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Mollie Hemingway (The Federalist) and Newt Gingrich (Former Speaker of the House) as authoritative sources supporting the argument that Trump is tough on Russia: "Here’s The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway explaining...", "Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, concurred...".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as only two options: either Trump is a "Russian mole" (portrayed as the media's absurd claim) OR he is "firm" and "tougher on Russia than Obama". Ignores nuanced positions in between or different interpretations of his actions/words.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "This is just silly." and "The constant hand-wringing... is just silly." are used to dismiss the opposing viewpoint outright without engaging with its substance, discouraging critical examination of the media's concerns.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The discussion of Brennan and Clapper's "failure to protect America" in 2016 ("It was their duty in 2016 – not candidate Trump’s") introduces an issue (their performance) that is largely irrelevant to the specific criticisms of Trump's words/actions regarding Russia, especially at the Helsinki summit, which is the context introduced by Gingrich.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Refutes the extreme argument that Trump is a "Russian mole" ("The media has been... arguing that his rhetoric is proof positive that he is some kind of Russian mole") and that critics want him to do nothing but criticize Putin ("I don’t quite know what people want"). These are exaggerated or misrepresented versions of the actual criticisms of Trump's specific statements (e.g., siding with Putin over US intelligence) and his overall rhetoric towards Russia.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – The entire core argument ("Trump is tougher than Obama") uses Obama's record as a deflection from criticisms of Trump's own actions and rhetoric. Specifically: "Where President Obama refused to provide serious weapons... President Trump has approved...", "President Trump has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being". This charges critics with hypocrisy by implying they didn't criticize Obama enough, deflecting from Trump.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on **Name Calling**, **Loaded Language**, and **Flag-Waving** to discredit critics ("left-wing media", "hysteria", "silly", "nastiness") and valorize Trump's actions ("tough", "firm", "weakening Russia"). It employs **Doubt**, **Red Herring**, and **Straw Men** to undermine opposing arguments and shift focus. The core argument relies on **Black & White Fallacy** (mole vs. tough) and **Whataboutism** (deflecting via Obama comparison). **Exaggeration/Minimization** is used consistently to denigrate opponents and praise Trump. **Appeal to Authority** (Hemingway, Gingrich) and **Repetition** (Kavanaugh poll, core message) reinforce the perspective. **Causal Oversimplification** presents complex geopolitical actions as simple proof of toughness. **Thought-Terminating Cliches** ("just silly") shut down opposing views. While the text cites specific actions (sanctions, weapon sales, expulsions), these facts are framed within and used to support a narrative constructed through numerous propaganda techniques aimed at persuading the reader to dismiss criticism of Trump and accept a singular, favorable interpretation of his Russia policy. The overwhelming and systematic use of these techniques indicates a strong propagandistic intent.
