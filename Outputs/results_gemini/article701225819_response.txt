1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Sofian Zakkout a "hatemonger" and his activities as "perfidious." It also refers to David Duke as a "white supremacist icon" and "hatemonger."

2. Repetition – Yes – The central message that Sofian Zakkout promotes bigotry, hate, and anti-Semitism is repeated throughout the article in various forms, such as "promoting Duke’s bigoted work," "Zakkout’s own documented bigotry," and "David Duke’s bigoted and inciting material is not the only hate Zakkout promotes."

3. Slogans – No – The text does not employ its own brief, memorable phrases to be repeated. It quotes slogans used by others (e.g., "Death to Israel") but does not use them as its own technique.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text links Zakkout to figures and ideologies associated with violence and hate (KKK, white nationalism). It explicitly mentions a fatal car attack at a rally where Duke was present, thereby instilling fear by associating Zakkout's promotional activities with real-world violence and a threat to the community.

5. Doubt – Yes – The article is designed to cast doubt on Zakkout's legitimacy as a community leader, stating that his positions on community boards provide him with a "facade of respectability" and that "in reality, he has done nothing to serve the community."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The title, "Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day," is an exaggeration of the act of posting four videos on a single day, framing it as a celebration. The claim that Zakkout has "done nothing to serve the community" is an absolute statement that is likely an exaggeration used to dismiss any potential positive contributions.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of national identity and safety by referencing the 9/11 attacks on "New York City and Washington D.C." and framing Zakkout's promotion of conspiracy theories about them as an affront. It also frames his actions as an attempt to "divide" the American community.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is replete with emotionally charged words intended to sway the reader, such as "hatemonger," "bigoted," "venomous," "perfidious," "grotesque," and "toxic hate."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text's core strategy is to discredit Zakkout by repeatedly associating him with David Duke (a KKK leader), Holocaust deniers, and a media outlet that describes Hitler as "the greatest leader in modern Western history."

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text uses a form of reverse bandwagon by stating, "there is no outcry from the community... It has been virtually ignored by everyone, save this author." This is designed to make the reader feel that they should break from the complacent majority and join the author's "correct" viewpoint.

11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not focus on explaining a complex event with a single cause. Instead, it lists a series of alleged actions by one individual to build a character indictment.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is the opposite of vague. It is highly specific, providing dates, direct quotes, and detailed descriptions of the content Zakkout allegedly promoted.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the "Anti-Defamation League (ADL)," a recognized authority on hate groups, stating that the "ADL condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA." It also names the "Director of Militant Islam Monitor" as a contributor to the report, adding perceived authority.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice. It implies that one must either condemn Zakkout or be complicit in his "hatemongering." The final paragraph argues that if others like Duke are condemned, Zakkout "can and must be as well," leaving no room for nuance or alternative actions.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The author of the text does not use clichés to shut down thought. The article's style is to present a large volume of specific (though one-sided) information to guide the reader to a conclusion.

16. Red herring – Yes – When discussing Zakkout posting a video of Duke from the Charlottesville rally, the text introduces the fact that "a white nationalist plowed his car into a group of people... killing one." This violent act is not directly related to Zakkout's action of posting a video, but it is included to associate him with murder by proxy and distract the reader with a powerful emotional detail.

17. Straw men – No – The article does not set up or refute a counter-argument. It is a direct, one-sided attack and does not engage with any potential defenses of Zakkout.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism of an opponent by accusing them of hypocrisy. It is a direct accusation against Zakkout.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform objectively but to persuade the audience to adopt an extremely negative view of Sofian Zakkout and to incite action against him ("It is time for Zakkout to be exposed and stripped of his public functions").

The text achieves this by employing a multitude of propaganda techniques. The argument is built almost entirely on **Name-calling** ("hatemonger"), **Loaded Language** ("perfidious," "venomous," "toxic hate"), and **Reduction ad Hitlerum** (the constant, central association of Zakkout with David Duke, the KKK, and Hitler admirers). It presents a one-sided narrative that functions as a character assassination, using an **Appeal to Fear** by linking Zakkout's alleged posts to real-world violence.

While the article presents specific, verifiable-sounding details (dates, quotes), which gives it a veneer of factual reporting, the framing is entirely manipulative. It uses the **Black & White Fallacy** to insist that condemnation is the only moral option and a **Red Herring** to associate Zakkout with a murder he had no direct part in. The entire piece is a prosecutorial brief, not a balanced report, as it lacks any comment from Zakkout, context for his actions, or alternative interpretations. The combination of its aggressive, one-sided nature, heavy reliance on emotional manipulation, and explicit call to action makes it a clear example of propaganda.
