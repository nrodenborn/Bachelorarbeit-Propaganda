### Verdict – 70% –   
**Explanation:** The text employs multiple propaganda techniques, including **name-calling** ("worst of the worst"), **repetition** (Kavanaugh poll), **appeal to fear** (school shooting plots, human remains), **exaggeration** (hyperbolic labels), **loaded language** ("filthy," "extremist," "radical"), **obfuscation** (vague claims about extremism), and **red herring** (irrelevant Sarsour/Kavanaugh inclusions). These techniques frame the story to provoke fear and bias by:  
- Linking unrelated individuals (Sarsour, Wahhaj’s father) to terrorism.  
- Using emotionally charged language to vilify Muslims.  
- Distracting with divisive political content (Kavanaugh poll).  
While factual elements exist (e.g., court allegations), the selective emphasis, sensationalized framing, and guilt-by-association tactics suggest a deliberate intent to manipulate perception. The lack of evidence for broad claims (e.g., Sarsour’s connection to the crimes) further supports propaganda aims. However, the inclusion of verifiable details (e.g., legal proceedings) prevents a 100% rating.
