### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Muslim Dem IT Aides" (headline) and "wacko lunatic" (Bacon mocking Gilani). Labels target subjects with negative connotations.  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated verbatim three times to emphasize the message.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans; the text relies on narrative descriptions.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – References to wiretapping, extortion, captivity, and "selling [House] information" imply threats to security and ethics.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions Abid’s legitimacy (e.g., mismatched signatures, timing of beneficiary change) and discredits Gilani’s lawyer (Hadeed’s fraud conviction).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: "held her in 'captivity'", "$300,000 wired to Pakistan" (framed as suspicious). Minimization: Downplays Abid’s bankruptcy irregularities.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No overt appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Bitter dispute," "mocked the elderly, burka-clad widow," "defiant Abid," "homeless" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to popularity; the poll is repetitive but not used to claim consensus.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Implies the life insurance change was definitively part of a fraud scheme, ignoring other explanations.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – "Associates and relatives have long accused the family of green" (vague accusation without specifics).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites prosecutors ("strong indications of flight"), the FBI, and court rulings to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Portrays Gilani as a helpless victim vs. the "corrupt" Awans, ignoring nuance.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" to shut down analysis.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Details about Hadeed’s past conviction distract from the case’s merits.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting opponents.

### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Selective Framing**: Focuses exclusively on allegations against the Awan family (fraud, extortion, wiretapping) while omitting counter-evidence or context.  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses loaded language ("burka-clad widow," "homeless") and appeals to fear ("captivity," "selling information") to vilify the subjects.  
3. **Bias Amplification**: Highlights the family’s Muslim identity, Democratic ties, and foreign connections (Pakistan, Ukraine) to imply disloyalty or criminality.  
4. **Source Discrediting**: Undermines Gilani’s lawyer (Hadeed) and amplifies Bacon’s insults ("wacko lunatic") to delegitimize one side.  
5. **Structural Propaganda Techniques**:  
   - Repetition of the "corrupt Democrat" poll pressures readers to adopt a viewpoint.  
   - Exaggeration/minimization skews perceptions (e.g., downplaying Abid’s bankruptcy issues).  
   - Obfuscation in vague accusations ("family of green").  
6. **Lack of Neutrality**: The tone is accusatory and sensationalist, presenting allegations as facts (e.g., "wiretapped and extorted her") without verification.  
7. **Political Agenda**: The framing (e.g., "Democratic IT aides," poll targeting Democrats) aligns with partisan narratives, aiming to discredit a specific group.  

While based on real events (court case, FBI investigation), the text’s manipulative techniques, omission of balance, and inflammatory language exceed objective reporting, making it primarily propagandistic.
