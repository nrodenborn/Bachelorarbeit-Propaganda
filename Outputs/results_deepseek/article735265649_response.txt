Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the given text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "illegals" (used multiple times) is an insulting label applied to the subjects of the arrests, replacing neutral terms like "undocumented immigrants" or "individuals".
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The term "illegals" is repeated multiple times (paragraphs 1, 4, 8).
3.  **Slogans – No** – No brief, memorable phrase is used as a slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Highlighting that arrestees have convictions for "assault and battery, crimes against children, weapons charges and DUI" and that "864 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions and other public safety threats 'remain at large'" instills fear about the dangers posed by undocumented immigrants.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "no thanks to the Democrat mayor of Oakland" immediately casts doubt on the mayor's actions and motives. "a Democrat mayor who betrayed the law-abiding citizens" further questions her credibility and loyalty.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration: Describing the mayor's warning as "reckless," a "betrayal," and suggesting she supports "criminality over law and order." Minimization: Oversimplifies the complex issue of immigration and sanctuary policies, framing the mayor's action purely as aiding criminals.
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Appeals to patriotism/law and order: "fulfill their sworn duty to protect public safety," "betrayed the law-abiding citizens," contrasting "law and order" with "criminality".
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Numerous emotionally charged words/phrases: "illegals," "snared," "fugitives," "no thanks to," "reckless decision," "political agenda," "undermine," "criminality," "betrayed," "law-abiding citizens," "tipped off".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No attempt to link ideas or groups to universally hated entities like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – No explicit appeal to the popularity of the idea being promoted.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Blames the mayor solely for the fact that "864 illegal immigrants... 'remain at large'" ("an indeterminate number of whom may have been tipped off by a Democrat mayor"), ignoring other complex factors contributing to individuals evading arrest.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes** – "multiple credible sources" (credibility undefined). "an indeterminate number" (vague quantification used to support blame). "other public safety threats" (vague category added to the 864).
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Uses statements from ICE Deputy Director Thomas Homan ("reckless decision," "based on her political agenda," "attempt to undermine ICE’s critical mission") and the report that "ICE officials are asking the Department of Justice to look into" the mayor as authoritative support.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents a stark dichotomy: Politicians (like the mayor) who "attempt to undermine ICE’s critical mission" and support "criminality" vs. ICE officers who "fulfill their sworn duty to protect public safety" and represent "law and order." Law-abiding citizens vs. criminal illegals.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "True to the left's support for criminality over law and order" shuts down discussion by attributing a broad, negative motive ("support for criminality") to an entire political group ("the left") based on this single action.
16. **Red herring – No** – The text stays focused on the arrests and the mayor's warning; no significant irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Portrays Mayor Schaaf's warning (motivated by sanctuary city policy and concerns for community trust/rights) as "support for criminality over law and order" and a "betrayal," refuting an argument (supporting criminals) she did not make.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The text criticizes the mayor directly for her specific action; it does not deflect criticism by charging her with unrelated hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs numerous propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Obfuscation, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating Clichés, Straw Men) to present a one-sided, emotionally charged narrative. Its primary purpose is not balanced reporting but to vilify a political opponent (the Democratic mayor and "the left"), demonize undocumented immigrants ("illegals," "criminal aliens," "fugitives," "public safety threats"), uncritically glorify ICE actions ("fulfill their sworn duty"), and frame the complex issue of immigration enforcement in starkly divisive terms ("law and order" vs. "criminality," "betrayal"). The pervasive use of loaded language and the selective framing of facts serve a clear persuasive agenda aligned with a specific political viewpoint. While based on real events (arrests, mayor's warning), the presentation is manipulative and designed to provoke a specific emotional response (anger, fear) against the targets.
