1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Tony Rezko as a “Syrian Christian crook” and the Iraq War as “stupid.”
2. Repetition – No – The text builds a cumulative argument but does not repeat the same message or phrase over and over.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states, “Malcolm X wasn’t adequately afraid of them. Here’s what happened to him:” followed by a link, directly associating the Nation of Islam with murder. It also stokes fear by suggesting Obama’s policies encouraged a “wave of black rage” that increased the “death toll from murder.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire piece is framed to create doubt about Obama's public image by revealing a suppressed photo and highlighting controversial associations, questioning his character and motives.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – It exaggerates by comparing the “incremental death toll” from a crime wave to the “U.S. combat death toll from the equally stupid Iraq War.” It uses sarcastic minimization when it asks, “what could be more boring than a story than involves a Presidential candidate, the Syrian Christian crook who helped him buy his house, the Nation of Islam, and the most famous boxer of all time?” to imply the media deliberately ignored a major story.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like “crook,” “shaking down,” and “black rage” to influence the reader's perception.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The technique is to discredit an idea by associating it with a group hated by the audience. The text repeatedly links Obama to Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, a controversial group, to tarnish Obama's reputation by association.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest its viewpoint is popular to persuade the audience.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests that Obama siding with Black Lives Matter directly “drove up the death toll from murder by 20%,” offering a single, simple cause for a complex social phenomenon.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The line “you might almost get the impression that after a prudent first term, during his second he might side with, I dunno, Black Lives Matter…” uses vague and non-committal language (“might almost get the impression,” “I dunno”) to plant a strong suggestion without making a direct, falsifiable claim.
13. Appeal to authority – No – While sources are cited (a photographer, Obama's memoir), they are used as evidence within an argument, not as an unimpeachable authority whose word should be taken as final proof.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present only two options for the reader.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down discussion.
16. Red herring – Yes – The mention of Malcolm X's murder is introduced to evoke fear and distract from the main point about the Obama photograph, steering the reader's emotions towards the perceived danger of the Nation of Islam.
17. Straw men – No – The text builds its own narrative rather than misrepresenting and refuting a specific counter-argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text is a direct attack on a subject and does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It moves beyond reporting on the existence of a photograph and instead uses it as a launchpad to construct a highly negative and persuasive narrative against Barack Obama. The piece is saturated with propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, loaded language, and causal oversimplification. Its primary method is discrediting by association (a form of Reduction ad Hitlerum), constantly linking Obama to the controversial figure Louis Farrakhan. It employs insinuation, exaggeration, and red herrings to cast doubt on Obama's character and presidency, blaming his administration for a rising murder rate. The purpose is clearly not to inform objectively but to persuade the audience to adopt a specific, hostile viewpoint, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
