***

Verdict – 95% – This text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the audience to adopt a negative view of Sofian Zakkout and to pressure the organizations he is affiliated with to sever ties with him.

The piece systematically employs a wide range of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. It relies heavily on **loaded language** ("venomous," "obscene travesty," "bigotry") and **name-calling** ("Anti-Semite Pastor," "white supremacist") to create a strong emotional aversion to Zakkout and his associates. It uses **appeal to fear** by linking him to a "terrorist organization" and framing him as a "threat to national security."

The argument is built on a foundation of guilt by association, repeatedly connecting Zakkout to widely condemned figures like David Duke and ideologies like Nazism (**Reduction ad Hitlerum**). It leverages the credibility of an established organization, the ADL (**appeal to authority**), to validate its claims.

Furthermore, the text presents a **black & white fallacy** as its conclusion, offering the board members only two choices: either expel Zakkout or be complicit in his alleged anti-Semitism. This tactic is designed to force a specific action. The entire article is a sustained charge of hypocrisy (**whataboutism**), questioning how a "Crime Stopper" can hold such views.

The one-sided presentation, which offers no counter-arguments, context, or statements from Zakkout or the boards in their own defense, combined with the heavy use of emotional manipulation and logical fallacies, confirms its nature as a propagandistic piece rather than objective journalism.
