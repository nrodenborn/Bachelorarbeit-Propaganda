Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "RINO Senator Jeff Flake", "self-professed sexual assaulter Cory Booker", "outgoing Flake, and good riddance", "someone... that actually has a spine".
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "good riddance" (used dismissively about Flake).
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "This country is being ripped apart here" (used by Flake, presented in the text contextually to imply danger from delay/investigation).
5.  **Doubt – No** – While the text questions Flake's motives and the need for an investigation, it doesn't explicitly frame this as doubting his *credibility* in the defined sense. It attacks his actions and character directly.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Minimization: "unsubstantiated allegations", "without a shred of evidence". Exaggeration: "subjected to far worse" (regarding Republican treatment under Obama).
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Implicitly appeals to Republican/Conservative identity through partisan framing ("party lines", "RINO", "Obama regime", contrasting with "We the People" implied control by Democrats). The attack on Flake for not having a "spine" implies he fails a test of partisan loyalty/strength.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "RINO", "unsubstantiated allegations", "pushing for", "outgoing Flake, and good riddance", "put through the ringer", "without a shred of evidence", "actually has a spine", "Obama regime", "subjected to far worse", "self-professed sexual assaulter Cory Booker".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or other universally hated groups like Vichy collaborators.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – No appeal to the popularity of an idea or action. The text focuses on attacking dissenters within the Republican side.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – No** – The text doesn't assign a single, simple cause to a complex event.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is relatively direct in its attacks and opinions, not deliberately obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – No authority figure is cited to support claims within the text itself.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Portrays Flake's actions as siding "with Senate Democrats" against Republicans, implying a binary choice: loyalty to party or siding with the enemy. Also implied in the "spine" comment – either you stand firm (with us) or you are a flake/spineless.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – The text uses arguments and attacks, not simplistic phrases designed to shut down thought (like "it is what it is" or "trust the plan").
16. **Red herring – No** – The focus remains on the Kavanaugh nomination, Flake's actions, and attacks on Democrats. While the "spine" comment and "good riddance" are attacks, they relate directly to the subject (Flake's role in the nomination process). The Nikki Haley poll is arguably a distraction but presented as a poll, not an argumentative diversion *within* the Kavanaugh narrative.
17. **Straw men – No** – The text attacks Flake's actual statements and actions (calling for an FBI investigation, expressing discomfort). It doesn't significantly misrepresent his position to make it easier to attack.
18. **Whataboutism – Yes** – "What about Judge Kavanaugh's comfort..." is a direct response to Flake saying he'd be more "comfortable" with an investigation, charging Flake with hypocrisy by implying he cares more about his own comfort than Kavanaugh's.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques, making it overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. Key indicators include:
*   **Strong Partisan Bias & Demonization:** Heavy use of **Name Calling** ("RINO", "good riddance", "no spine", "self-professed sexual assaulter", "Obama regime") and **Loaded Language** throughout paints opponents (Flake, Democrats) in extremely negative, often personally insulting terms while minimizing the allegations against Kavanaugh.
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** Techniques like **Appeal to Fear** ("country being ripped apart"), **Flag-Waving** (appeal to partisan loyalty), and **Whataboutism** are used to evoke anger and solidarity among the target audience against perceived enemies and traitors (like Flake).
*   **Repetition & Slogans:** The repeated poll question acts as **Repetition**, and the dismissive "good riddance" functions as a **Slogan**.
*   **Oversimplification & Distortion:** **Black & White Fallacy** frames the situation as "us vs. them" with no middle ground, while **Exaggeration/Minimization** downplays the allegations and exaggerates Republican victimhood under Obama.
*   **Purpose:** The clear intent is not balanced reporting but to rally the intended audience (conservative Republicans) against Flake and Democrats, discredit the investigation, and support Kavanaugh's confirmation through emotional appeals, character attacks, and biased framing. The factual reporting of the vote is buried within this highly charged, manipulative narrative. The permission note from "The Washington Standard" (a known partisan outlet) further supports this context.
