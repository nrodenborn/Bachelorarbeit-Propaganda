Based on the definitions provided and the analysis of the text, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique, followed by the final verdict:

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "Obama Regime" (used twice) is an insulting label replacing the neutral "Obama Administration," implying illegitimacy or authoritarianism.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – "ADVANTAGE AMERICANS" is repeated three times in quick succession to emphasize a point.
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – "TRUMP EFFECT!" serves as a memorable, repeated phrase encapsulating the core message.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text implies fear of immigrant "displacement" of American workers ("Native-born American workers lost ground to their foreign-born competitors") and suggests an "unreported illegal alien surge was underway" under Obama.
5.  **Doubt** – No – No explicit questioning of credibility is present. The text asserts its claims confidently.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Trump's impact is exaggerated with terms like "whopping" (native-born employment rise) and "striking" (decline). Obama's tenure is minimized/demonized by labeling it a "Regime" and blaming it for job losses.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Repeated emphasis on "ADVANTAGE AMERICANS," contrasting "American workers" against "foreign-born competitors," and framing Trump's policies as benefiting "his voters" appeals directly to national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Widespread use of emotionally charged or biased terms: "displacement," "retreat," "Regime," "surge," "whopping," "striking," "damage," "roared back," "foreign competitors," "capitulation" (re: DACA).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or universally hated groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text doesn't argue that Trump's policies are good *because* they are popular; it focuses on claimed results.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes complex economic changes (decline in immigrant workforce, rise in native employment, low black unemployment, blue-collar wage growth) almost solely to Trump's election/enforcement ("Trump Effect"), ignoring other potential economic factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – While biased, the statistical presentation is relatively clear. Terms like "Trump Effect" are loaded but not intentionally vague/confusing in definition here.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites The Economist ("Blue-collar wages are surging") and CNNMoney (black unemployment rate) to support claims about wage growth and unemployment statistics.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents the job market as a zero-sum competition between "Native-born Americans" and "Immigrants" ("displacement"), framing success for one group inherently as loss for the other ("ADVANTAGE AMERICANS" vs. implied disadvantage).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Phrases like "TRUMP EFFECT!" and "ADVANTAGE AMERICANS" are used to encapsulate complex issues and shut down deeper critical analysis of the causes or implications.
16. **Red herring** – No – The core argument (jobs/immigration stats under Trump vs. Obama) remains consistent. The opening dismissal of "Wolff book" and "DACA dalliance" is a contrast but not a full diversion from the main topic.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text criticizes Obama's policies directly based on its interpretation of data ("eight years of Obama" causing "damage," "surge"), not a misrepresented argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text contrasts Trump and Obama eras but does not charge critics/opponents with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

### Final Verdict
**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is to promote a singular, highly positive narrative of the "Trump Effect" on the economy (specifically jobs and immigration) while systematically denigrating the previous administration using inflammatory language ("Obama Regime"). It relies heavily on **Loaded Language**, **Name Calling**, **Appeal to Fear** (of immigrant competition), **Flag-Waving**, **Causal Oversimplification** (attributing complex trends solely to Trump), **Black & White Fallacy** (Americans vs. Immigrants), and **Thought-Terminating Clichés** ("TRUMP EFFECT!", "ADVANTAGE AMERICANS"). While it uses statistical data, the data is presented selectively and interpreted through a heavily biased lens to support a predetermined conclusion. The overall tone is celebratory of Trump and disparaging of Obama, prioritizing persuasive impact over balanced or objective analysis. The consistent application of multiple techniques confirms its function as propaganda. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of factual data points, though their interpretation and framing are propagandistic.
