Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "Child Rapists" (Headline), "Sanctuary City Mayor" (used pejoratively).
2.  **Repetition** – No – While themes are repeated, the *exact same phrase or message* isn't repeated verbatim multiple times.
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – "Sanctuary city" (used as a politically charged label).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "The price of a sanctuary city for illegal aliens is paid in abused children." and the focus on serious/violent crimes, especially child sex crimes, linked to sanctuary policies.
5.  **Doubt** – No – No direct questioning of the credibility of a specific source or fact presented. The text accepts ICE's statements.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – *Exaggeration:* The headline implies the mayor *specifically* tipped off "child rapists." The phrase "paid in abused children" is hyperbolic. *Minimization:* The mayor's stated reasons ("protect public safety," "live without fear") are dismissed without serious counter-argument.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Child Rapists," "abused children," "illegal aliens," "tipped off," "nabbed," "serious and violent crimes," "thwarted" (implying the mayor actively helped criminals). These terms carry strong negative connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis or hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to the popularity of the idea being promoted.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – "The price of a sanctuary city... is paid in abused children." Simplistically attributes child abuse *directly* to sanctuary city policies, ignoring complex social factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text presents specific numbers and claims (ICE arrest stats, mayor's warning) relatively directly, even if framed tendentiously.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites ICE officials and their statistics/statements as definitive evidence supporting the narrative.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Implied throughout: Sanctuary cities *protect dangerous criminals* (like child rapists) vs. ICE enforcement *protects children*. Ignores nuances of immigration policy, due process, or community policing concerns raised by the mayor.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "The price of a sanctuary city for illegal aliens is paid in abused children." This dramatic, emotionally charged phrase shuts down nuanced discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No – The focus remains on the link between sanctuary policies, the mayor's warning, and the arrest of criminals. No significant irrelevant distraction is introduced.
17. **Straw men** – Yes – The headline and text frame the mayor's warning as primarily "tipping off child rapists," ignoring her stated rationale (reducing panic, protecting community trust/safety). It refutes this extreme mischaracterization instead of her actual argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated issues.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. While it contains factual elements (ICE operation details, arrest statistics, the mayor's warning and statement), these facts are presented through a lens heavily employing numerous propaganda techniques. The inflammatory headline using Name Calling and Loaded Language sets a highly biased tone. The core message relies on Appeal to Fear, Causal Oversimplification, and a Black & White Fallacy to simplistically blame sanctuary cities and the mayor for child abuse and protect violent criminals. Key techniques like Loaded Language, Straw Men (misrepresenting the mayor's intent), Exaggeration (headline implication, "paid in abused children"), Minimization (of the mayor's rationale), and Thought-Terminating Clichés are used pervasively to evoke strong negative emotions (fear, anger, outrage) and discredit the opposing viewpoint without engaging fairly with its substance. The primary purpose is not balanced information but persuasion against sanctuary city policies by associating them with the most heinous crimes.
