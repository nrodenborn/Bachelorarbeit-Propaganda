Here's the analysis of the text against the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "criminal Democrat Party", "Fauxahontas". These are insulting labels applied to the subjects.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, brief, memorable phrase is used as a slogan within the text itself (though it references external ones like "BUILD THE WALL").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The poll implies fear about the migrant caravan ("marching toward the U.S. border") and asks about using military force, appealing to fear of invasion or threat.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Describing Christine Blasey Ford's accusations as "unsubstantiated and uncorroborated" casts doubt on their credibility.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "criminal Democrat Party" is a significant exaggeration. Minimizing Ford's accusations as "36-year-old allegations in which there are no witnesses and no evidence" downplays their seriousness.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While appealing to voters ("good people of Massachusetts"), it doesn't overtly appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "criminal Democrat Party", "Fauxahontas", "gung ho", "bite you", "unethical practice" are emotionally charged terms appealing to stereotypes and negative emotions.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or Vichy collaborators are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – The poll ("Should military force be used...") and the call to action ("Could the good people of Massachusetts do us all a favor...") imply joining a popular or correct stance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – "Looks like when you are so gung ho to go after someone based on 36-year-old allegations... it will eventually come back to bite you." Simplifies complex ethics and political consequences to simple karma.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The accusations and arguments, while biased, are stated relatively clearly. The nature of the alleged ethics violation is explained.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites the watchdog group FACT and its executive director, Kendra Arnold, to validate the ethics complaint.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – While highly critical, the text doesn't explicitly present only two absolute choices on the main topic.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "and rightly so" used after announcing the ethics complaint shuts down critical examination of its validity. "Of course, but..." dismisses potential consequences without discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The entire poll section about using military force against migrants is completely irrelevant to the main story about the ethics complaint against Harris and Warren, serving to distract and inflame.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks Harris and Warren based on specific actions (fundraising emails) and statements (Harris on Ford), not a misrepresented position.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text focuses solely on Harris and Warren; it doesn't deflect by accusing others of hypocrisy on this specific point.

**Verdict – 85% – Explanation:** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is not balanced reporting but to aggressively attack Senators Harris and Warren using emotionally charged language (Name Calling, Loaded Language, Exaggeration), casting doubt on their actions and motives (Doubt, Causal Oversimplification), validating the attack through selective authority (Appeal to Authority), discouraging critical thought (Thought-terminating clichés), and distracting with an unrelated inflammatory issue (Red Herring via the migrant poll). The repetitive poll and Bandwagon appeal further manipulate reader engagement. While it reports a factual event (an ethics complaint filed), the framing, language, and inclusion of the irrelevant poll are overwhelmingly designed to persuade through manipulation rather than inform through reasoned argument. The lack of countervailing perspectives or context (e.g., standard political fundraising practices, details of the ethics rules cited) reinforces its propagandistic nature.
