Name calling – No – The text does not use any insulting labels to attack a person or group. It refers to individuals by their official titles and describes Puerto Rico's financial situation with factual terms like "bankrupt."

Repetition – No – While figures are mentioned multiple times, it is to break down the total aid package for clarity. The text does not repeat a persuasive message or phrase to indoctrinate the reader.

Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases designed to rally support for or against something.

Appeal to fear – No – The text describes the devastating effects of Hurricane Maria, but it does so to provide factual context for the disaster aid. It does not use fear to advocate for a particular course of action over another.

Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person, group, or statement. It reports information and attributes it to its source.

Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text provides specific figures for the aid received and the amount requested. The statement that the aid is "just a fraction" of what is needed is a factual comparison of the numbers provided ($16 billion vs. $94.4 billion), not an emotional exaggeration.

Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions the "U.S. territory" and "U.S. Congress" as factual identifiers, not as an appeal to patriotism.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that the aid package is good or should be supported because it is popular.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is specific and clear, using precise numbers and citing the sources of information, such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.

Appeal to authority – No – The text cites authorities like Governor Rossello and President Trump to report their statements and actions, which is standard journalistic practice for sourcing information. It does not use their authority as proof that a particular opinion is correct.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present only two choices. It discusses various components of the aid, the amount received versus the amount needed, and the possibility of future funding.
