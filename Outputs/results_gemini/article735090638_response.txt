Name calling – Yes – The text labels the mayor as a "#Resistance Mayor" and a "radical leftist boss."

Repetition – Yes – The core message that the mayor’s actions were dangerous and illegal is repeated through various phrasings, such as "helping criminals," "endangering ICE personnel," "quite clearly illegal," "obstructed justice," and "irresponsible decision."

Slogans – No – The text does not employ brief, memorable phrases that function as slogans.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by stating that because of the mayor's actions, "864 'criminal aliens and public safety threats' remain at large in the community" and that the "community's a lot less safe."

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the mayor's credibility by stating she "claimed that she had cleared her actions with lawyers beforehand" and that her decision was "based on her political agenda," casting doubt on her stated motives.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The statement "And Dems have become honorary members of MS-13" is a significant exaggeration that equates a political party with a violent gang.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical phrases like "Illegal Criminals," "radical leftist boss," and "collaborate with illegal alien gang members."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of an idea/group (Democrats supporting the mayor) by suggesting it is popular with a group hated by the audience ("And Dems have become honorary members of MS-13").

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text asserts that over 800 criminals are at large specifically "thanks to the mayor’s irresponsible decision," simplifying a complex law enforcement outcome to a single, direct cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text's language is direct and its accusations are clear, not intentionally vague.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on the statements and position of "Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE" and the "Department of Justice" to validate its claims.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: siding with ICE and law and order, or siding with the mayor who is framed as helping "criminals" and "gang members," ignoring any middle ground or nuance.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "That's exactly it" is used to affirm an analogy as fact and discourage further thought. The final sentence, "And those who collaborate with illegal alien gang members should face the consequences," is presented as an indisputable conclusion to end debate.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the broad claim that "Dems have become honorary members of MS-13," which distracts from the specific legal question of the mayor's actions by shifting the attack to an entire political party.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a position that the mayor did not take—that she is actively helping gang members. It creates a straw man of her as a collaborator with criminals ("honorary members of MS-13") and attacks that, rather than her stated, more complex reasoning.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to excuse an action by charging an opponent with hypocrisy on a different matter.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to provide a balanced report on a news event, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint of Mayor Schaaf and, by extension, the Democratic party. This is achieved through the heavy and combined use of numerous propaganda techniques.

The piece consistently uses **loaded language** ("Illegal Criminals," "radical leftist boss") and **name-calling** to frame the mayor negatively from the outset. It makes a strong **appeal to fear**, claiming hundreds of "public safety threats" are at large directly because of her. The argument is built on an **appeal to authority**, using quotes from ICE and the DOJ to present a one-sided case as objective fact, while simultaneously casting **doubt** on the mayor's motives.

Most tellingly, the text employs extreme **exaggeration** and **reduction ad hitlerum** by equating Democrats with the MS-13 gang. This, combined with the **black & white fallacy** that you either support law enforcement or collaborate with criminals, leaves no room for critical thought. The use of **thought-terminating clichés** ("That's exactly it.") serves to shut down any potential nuance or discussion. The text's goal is emotional persuasion and ideological reinforcement, not objective information, making it a clear example of propaganda.
