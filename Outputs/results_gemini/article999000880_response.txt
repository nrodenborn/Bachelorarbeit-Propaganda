1. Name calling – Yes – While the text doesn't use overt slurs against the migrants, it repeatedly uses the label "illegal" ("illegal entry," "illegal immigrants") to frame them and their actions negatively. The poll about Jim Acosta also includes the option "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass," which is a direct use of name-calling.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times in a row. The concept of the border being "reinforced" and the migrants' entry being "illegal" are also mentioned multiple times to reinforce the central message.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief, memorable phrase as a recurring slogan to encapsulate an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses language designed to create fear and alarm. Examples include the headline "They Are Coming," the description of an "impending migrant 'invasion'," and the detailed listing of military assets like "drones, helicopters with night-vision capabilities."
5. Doubt – No – The article does not focus on questioning the credibility of a specific person or source regarding the caravan. It presents its own narrative as fact.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the threat posed by the caravan by describing it as an "invasion" and detailing the significant military force ("5,200 troops," "drones, helicopters") being deployed against what is a group of unarmed migrants.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The article appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a matter of national security, mentioning "American forces" protecting the "US border" from an outside threat.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's perception. Examples include "invasion," "thwart," and the ominous headline "They Are Coming."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to groups like the Nazis or other historically hated figures.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest the reader should adopt a viewpoint because it is already popular with the majority.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The article presents the complex issue of mass migration, which has deep socioeconomic and political roots, as a simple problem of people deciding to cross a border "illegally," which must be stopped by force.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article's message is quite direct and not deliberately unclear. It aims for a clear, albeit biased, narrative.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly uses President Trump as an authority to legitimize its narrative, citing his orders and quoting his description of the caravan as an "invasion" and his statement that immigrants must have "merit."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice: either people enter "legally" with "merit" or they are part of an "illegal" "invasion" that must be stopped. This ignores the complexities and legal nuances of seeking asylum.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The poll option, "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass," is a dismissive phrase that shuts down nuanced discussion about press freedom and conduct with a simplistic, judgmental cliché.
16. Red herring – Yes – The entire section with the poll about CNN's Jim Acosta is irrelevant to the topic of the migrant caravan. It serves to distract the reader and pivot to a different political grievance.
17. Straw men – No – The text primarily presents a one-sided narrative and does not engage with or misrepresent a specific counter-argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy on another issue.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It moves beyond objective reporting by employing a multitude of propaganda techniques to construct a specific, fear-based narrative. The article uses loaded language ("invasion," "thwart"), appeals to fear ("They Are Coming"), and flag-waving (protecting the "US border") to frame the migrants as a hostile threat. It simplifies a complex humanitarian issue into a black-and-white problem of legality versus illegality, using the authority of the President to validate this frame. Furthermore, the inclusion of a completely irrelevant and repetitive poll about Jim Acosta serves as a red herring to distract the reader and engage them on a separate partisan issue, while also functioning as a data-collection tool for a website called "Truth Uncensored," which itself suggests a biased agenda. The combination of these techniques shows a clear intent to persuade and provoke an emotional reaction rather than to inform objectively.
