---

**Verdict – 95% –** The text heavily relies on propagandistic techniques to discredit the Mueller investigation. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded language ("witch hunt," "disgrace") and name-calling ("Angry Democrats," "weak sister") dominate the text.  
- **Repetition & sloganeering**: Phrases like "Rigged Witch Hunt" and "Sessions is a weak sister" are repeated to entrench negative framing.  
- **Distortion**: Exaggerations ("stealth coup") and straw-man arguments reframe the investigation as a partisan conspiracy.  
- **Suppression of nuance**: Thought-terminating clichés ("Disgraceful!") and red herrings (Dossier funding) avoid substantive discussion.  
While the text includes factual elements (e.g., Sessions' recusal, Manafort's trial), its primary goal is persuasion through demonization and oversimplification. The sheer density of propagandistic techniques (10/18 identified) suggests deliberate messaging aimed at delegitimizing opponents, not balanced reporting.
