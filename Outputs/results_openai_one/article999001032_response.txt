Certainly! Here’s the analysis for each propaganda technique according to your instructions:

---

1. **Name calling** – Yes – The text refers to Gillum as “a part of the crazy, crazy, crazies” and describes Florida as a “cracker state,” both of which are derogatory labels.
2. **Repetition** – No – The text does not repeat the same phrase or message in a way that constitutes repetition as a technique.
3. **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as slogans in the text.
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text suggests deception and hidden agendas (“empty promises,” “deceiving voters,” “secret gun control agenda”), which could instill fear about the candidate’s intentions.
5. **Doubt** – Yes – The text repeatedly questions Gillum’s honesty and credibility (“Gillum Makes Promises He Can’t Keep,” “candidate lying to the voters”).
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The text exaggerates by saying “none of the programs that people are hoping for would happen” and “that will never happen,” minimizing the possibility of any campaign promise being fulfilled.
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words and phrases like “empty promises,” “fairy tales,” “crazy, crazy, crazies,” and “deceiving voters” are emotionally charged.
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There is no comparison to Nazis or similarly hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not appeal to popularity or suggest that “everyone” is doing or believing something.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text oversimplifies complex political realities, e.g., “That will never happen” due to a Republican legislature, ignoring nuances or possible exceptions.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – Phrases like “secret gun control agenda” and “not for [voters] to know” are vague and suggest hidden motives without specifics.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites campaign insiders and party officials as sources of truth about Gillum’s intentions.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text frames the situation as Gillum either telling the truth or lying about everything, with no middle ground.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – The phrase “modern day fairy tales start with ‘once I am elected’” serves to shut down further discussion about campaign promises.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The discussion about “whipping up” voters and “appealing to white guilt” distracts from the main issue of campaign promises.
17. **Straw men** – Yes – The text suggests that Gillum is “being painted” as a socialist or “crazy,” which may not be his actual position, and then attacks that constructed position.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge opponents with hypocrisy or shift blame to others.

**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict – 95% –**  
The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques, including name calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, black & white fallacy, and more. It is structured to undermine the credibility of Andrew Gillum and his campaign by using emotionally charged language, oversimplifying complex issues, and presenting insider testimony as definitive proof of dishonesty. The intent is clearly to sway the reader’s opinion against Gillum rather than to present a balanced or nuanced account. The presence of multiple, overlapping propaganda techniques strongly indicates that this text is propaganda, with only a very small possibility that it is not, hence the 95% likelihood.
