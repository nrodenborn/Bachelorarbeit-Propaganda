**Verdict – 85% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, black & white fallacy, red herring, and straw men. These techniques are used to undermine Christine Ford's credibility and portray her actions as part of a politically motivated attack on Kavanaugh. The presence of these techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is propaganda, as it aims to persuade the audience through emotional and biased arguments rather than presenting a balanced view of the situation.**
