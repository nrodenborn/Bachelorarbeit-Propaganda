Name calling – Yes – The text uses the term “criminal aliens” to label the people being arrested. This is an insulting label that conflates immigration status with criminality.

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the term “criminal aliens” and emphasizes the criminal histories of the individuals and the theme of “public safety” to reinforce the message.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases that stand alone as slogans.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text supports the ICE operation by listing crimes allegedly committed by some of the arrestees, such as “child neglect, child abuse, drug offenses, fraud and larceny,” instilling fear that these individuals are a threat to public safety.

Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or entity; it presents its own information as authoritative.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text states that “Several of the aliens targeted… had prior criminal histories,” but it focuses heavily on these cases, potentially exaggerating the criminality of the entire group of 20 people to make the operation seem more critical to public safety.

Flag-Waving – No – The text appeals to the authority of a U.S. government agency and U.S. law, but it does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged terms like “criminal aliens” and “public safety threats” to create a negative impression of the people arrested.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its position is popular or that the reader should agree because everyone else does.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The quote from Ricardo Wong, “Because of the tireless efforts of these professional officers, there are fewer criminals in our communities,” presents a simple cause (this single operation) for a complex issue (the overall crime rate in the community).

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses the vague term “Several” when describing how many of the 20 arrestees had criminal histories, and it groups “criminal aliens and immigration violators” together, blurring the line between criminal acts and civil immigration infractions like overstaying a visa.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text quotes Ricardo Wong, the “field office director for ERO Chicago,” using his position of authority to validate the operation and its importance to public safety.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present the situation as a choice between only two options.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any clichés intended to stop critical thought.

Red herring – No – All the information presented, while biased, is directly relevant to the ICE operation being described.

Straw men – No – The text does not set up or refute a counter-argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 85% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. Although it is presented as a factual press release from a government agency, it systematically employs numerous propaganda techniques to frame the event in a way that generates public support for ICE and its methods. The primary techniques are Loaded Language and Name Calling (e.g., "criminal aliens," "public safety threats"), which serve to dehumanize the arrested individuals and pre-emptively label them as dangerous. This is reinforced by an Appeal to Fear, which selectively highlights the worst alleged offenses ("child abuse," "drug offenses") to create a sense of threat. The piece also uses an Appeal to Authority by quoting an ICE director to legitimize the operation, and Causal Oversimplification to claim a direct, positive impact on community safety ("fewer criminals in our communities"). The cumulative effect is a one-sided narrative that justifies the agency's actions by portraying a complex immigration issue as a simple matter of removing dangerous criminals, thereby discouraging critical assessment of the operation.
