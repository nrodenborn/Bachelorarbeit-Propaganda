Verdict – 5% – The text is primarily informational and reports on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It provides factual details about the situation, including the response by health authorities and the WHO. The only potential propaganda technique identified is an appeal to authority, as it references the WHO and Dr. Matshidiso Moeti. However, this is a common practice in reporting health-related news and does not necessarily indicate propaganda. Therefore, the likelihood of the text being propaganda is very low.
