### Propaganda Technique Analysis  
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "notorious fraud, a russo-phobe intelligence asset" (attacking Luke Harding), "cranky identity grievances stories" (attacking The Guardian's content).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeats "fake news" (e.g., "Guardian's fake news story," "fake news about a fake news story") and "can't be trusted" (title and closing).  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans; descriptive labels instead.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "no western main stream media can any longer be trusted" (instills fear about media reliability).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "weakly sourced," "gaping holes," "no public evidence" (questions The Guardian's credibility).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "bone-chilling about journalism," "fascist propaganda tropes." Minimization: Downplays Guardian's updates/corrections as "silently edited."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "smear," "vilifying," "concocted by British intelligence," "manipulative propaganda" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – "uses fascist propaganda tropes to smear the Russian people," "publishing Goebbels' cartoons" (links The Guardian to Nazis).  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "several people... were immediately suspicious," "Glenn Greenwald noted," "other outlets... debunked" (appeals to popular skepticism).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes complex media failures to singular causes: "outlet for British government disinformation," "peddled by British secret services."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct, not obscure (e.g., specific dates, quotes, and events cited).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites "Jonathan Cook, a former Guardian writer," and "Moon of Alabama" as authoritative critics.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – "no western main stream media can any longer be trusted" (presents all media as corrupt, ignoring nuance).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "fake news," "disinformation," "regurgitates an elite-serving narrative" (shuts down critical analysis).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Brings up unrelated issues: Edward Snowden’s book, Skripal affair, and Politico’s errors to distract from the core argument.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Refutes unclaimed arguments: Assumes The Guardian asserted CCTV evidence existed (it didn’t), then attacks this ("If Manafort had really visited... it would have long been known").  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy toward critics; focuses on attacking The Guardian.  

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs 14/18 techniques, including **name-calling**, **loaded language**, and **reduction ad Hitlerum** to vilify The Guardian and its journalists. Core strategies include:  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Fear-mongering about media trustworthiness and using terms like "bone-chilling" or "fascist tropes."  
- **Distortion of facts**: Selectively omits The Guardian’s updates/denials while amplifying errors (e.g., ignoring added caveats).  
- **Conspiracy framing**: Attributes the story to "British secret services" and "disinformation operations" without evidence.  
- **Suppressing dissent**: Uses **thought-terminating clichés** ("fake news") and **black/white fallacies** to dismiss all mainstream media.  
While based on a real event (The Guardian’s retracted Manafort-Assange story), the text’s one-sided narrative, lack of counterpoints, and hyperbolic language aim to delegitimize The Guardian as part of a broader ideological agenda. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the factual basis of the initial story’s debunking, but the presentation is manipulative propaganda.
