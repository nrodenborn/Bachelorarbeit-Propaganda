3. **Slogans** – Yes – "We will not be silenced" (memorable phrase rallying support).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warns that censorship will expand ("silence you" eventually), invoking fear of losing free speech.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Facebook's credibility: "this couldn’t be further from the truth" regarding Facebook's stated reasons for the purge.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates impact ("wipe out independent media," "memory-holed," "beginning of the end of censored media"); minimizes Facebook’s rationale as "nonsense."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No overt appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Egregious," "nefarious," "purge," "memory-holed," "plutocratic establishment" (emotionally charged terms).

10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Highlights 6 million followers and 4.1-star reviews to imply validity via popularity.

13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites tweets from figures like Glenn Greenwald and Daniel McAdams to bolster credibility.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Frames media as "independent/truthful vs. mainstream/corrupt" with no middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "We will not be silenced," "thorn in their side" (shuts down deeper analysis).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Mentions "Your News Wire" remaining active to distract from Facebook’s stated reasons.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Refutes "ad farms" claim (Facebook’s argument) as "tricking people," misrepresenting it as entirely dishonest.

### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of persuasive techniques to advance a specific agenda. Key indicators:  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language ("purge," "egregious") and fear appeals (censorship "will silence you") dominate.  
- **Us-vs-Them Framing**: Portrays "independent media" as virtuous victims versus corrupt "tech giants," "mainstream media," and the "plutocratic establishment."  
- **Selective Evidence**: Dismisses Facebook’s explanations while highlighting follower counts and reviews to imply legitimacy.  
- **Conspiracy Undertones**: Suggests coordination between tech companies, government, and neoconservative groups (e.g., Atlantic Council).  
- **Call to Action**: Urges readers to subscribe, donate, or join alternative platforms, reinforcing mobilization goals.  

While based on real events (e.g., page removals), the text omits counter-evidence, exaggerates implications ("beginning of the end of censored media"), and uses emotional persuasion over balanced analysis. Its primary aim is to rally support against perceived censorship, not explore nuance. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges factual elements (e.g., citation of Facebook’s statement), but the overwhelming bias places it firmly in propaganda territory.
