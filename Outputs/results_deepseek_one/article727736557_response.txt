Below is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the provided text, followed by the final verdict. The analysis adheres strictly to the definitions provided.

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – Explanation: The text uses derogatory labels like "crackpots," "bonkers conspiracy site," "ludicrous theory," "noxious far-right personality," and "conspiracy-mongers" to attack conspiracy theorists and their claims.  
2. **Repetition** – No – Explanation: No specific phrase or message is repeated throughout the text to reinforce an idea.  
3. **Slogans** – No – Explanation: There are no brief, memorable phrases used to summarize an argument (e.g., no equivalents to "BUILD THE WALL").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – Explanation: While death threats against Haig are described, the text does not use this to instill fear to support an alternative idea.  
5. **Doubt** – No – Explanation: The text does not explicitly question the credibility of individuals or institutions; it reports claims neutrally.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Explanation: Minimization occurs in descriptions of conspiracy theories (e.g., "wild claims," "ludicrous theory") and in Haig’s defense (e.g., "merely sold Paddock the rounds").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – Explanation: No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty (e.g., "We the People") are present.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Explanation: Emotionally charged terms like "embroiled," "death threats," "pounded on his door," "deserves to die," "seized on," "wild claims," "lurking," "cover," "cut-out," "noxious," and "shadow government" evoke strong emotions.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or universally hated groups (e.g., no equivalents to "Vichy journalism").  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Explanation: Popularity is not cited to validate claims (e.g., no "everyone agrees" arguments).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Explanation: Complex events (e.g., the shooting) are not reduced to a single cause; multiple factors are acknowledged.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Explanation: The text is clear and specific (e.g., details about Haig’s employment, ammunition sales).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Explanation: No authoritative figures or institutions are cited to validate claims (e.g., no "experts agree" statements).  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Explanation: The text avoids presenting only two choices; it acknowledges nuances (e.g., Haig’s denials vs. theorists’ suspicions).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – Explanation: No phrases are used to shut down critical thought (e.g., no "it is what it is" equivalents).  
16. **Red herring** – No – Explanation: All content is relevant to the central topic (conspiracy theories about Haig).  
17. **Straw men** – No – Explanation: The text accurately represents conspiracy theorists’ claims (e.g., air assaults, CIA involvement) without distortion.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no "what about X?" arguments).  

### Verdict – 30% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text exhibits some propaganda techniques—primarily **name-calling** (e.g., "crackpots," "bonkers") and **loaded language** (e.g., "death threats," "ludicrous theory")—to discredit conspiracy theorists and minimize their claims. However, it primarily functions as **journalistic reporting**. It presents factual details (e.g., Haig’s occupation, legal ammunition sales), quotes multiple sources (Haig, his attorney, conspiracy theorists), and avoids overt persuasion. The tone is critical of conspiracy theories but does not advance a specific agenda beyond condemning harassment. The limited use of propaganda techniques (3/18) serves to frame theorists as irrational, but the core content remains informational. Thus, the text is not predominantly propagandistic; it is 30% likely to be propaganda due to biased language choices rather than systematic manipulation.
