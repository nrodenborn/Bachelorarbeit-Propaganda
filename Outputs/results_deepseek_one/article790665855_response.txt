### Verdict – 95% – Propaganda  
**Explanation:**  
The text extensively employs propaganda techniques to manipulate perception:  
- **Emotional Manipulation:** Uses fear ("police state"), loaded language ("tyrannical"), and name-calling ("enemy of the Fourth Amendment") to provoke outrage.  
- **Distortion:** Minimizes sexual misconduct allegations as a media "distraction" while exaggerating Kavanaugh’s judicial record via Nazi comparisons ("Gestapo").  
- **False Dilemmas:** Framed as a binary choice between constitutional freedom and tyranny, ignoring nuance.  
- **Selective Authority:** Quotes figures like Rand Paul to legitimize claims while dismissing mainstream discourse ("left and right are involved in a mudslinging orgy").  
- **Repetition & Sloganeering:** Reinforces key messages (e.g., "Fourth Amendment," "#StoptheNDAA") to cement bias.  
The article’s goal is not balanced analysis but to delegitimize Kavanaugh and the media using emotionally charged, oversimplified, and fear-based rhetoric. While it cites factual cases (e.g., GPS tracking dissent), these are weaponized to fuel an agenda, aligning with propaganda’s core function: to persuade through manipulation rather than evidence-based argument.
