Here is the analysis of the text against the defined propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "anti-Israel BDS hate group", "anti-Semite", "anti-Israel activists", "radical anti-Jewish and anti-Israel left", "hate group", "anti-Israel leftists".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on AJHS partnering with JVP ("AJHS and JVP partnership", "AJHS’s partnership with JVP", "AJHS partnership with JVP", "co-sponsoring events with a hate group", "When JVP is at AJHS").
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – While phrases like "BUILD THE WALL!" are quoted from others, the text itself does not create or use its own distinct, brief, memorable phrase as a slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "The radical anti-Israel left will not be satisfied... Instead it seeks to normalize the furthest extremes of anti-Israel hatred."; Linking AJHS/JVP actions to being intimidated like in Nazi Germany ("When we think about Nazi Germany..."); Warning about being blacklisted/smeared ("The anti-Israel left has built networks that can blacklist, smear and silence...").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Is co-sponsoring events with a hate group... also apolitical scholarship?" (Doubting AJHS's claimed neutrality); "support for them and for Myers cannot be distinguished from support for their views" (Doubting the motives/independence of supporters).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – *Exaggeration:* Labeling JVP as a "hate group" repeatedly, linking it directly to "blood libels" and defending Hamas/terrorism; Framing the event as "Destroy Israel Event". *Minimization:* Minimizing the AJHS's stated goal of offering "different perspectives" by asserting "when it comes to Israel, there’s only one perspective."
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to Jewish identity and loyalty: "Either you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews."; "What would he [Leo Forchheimer] think if he knew the anti-Israel purposes that CJH is putting his gift to?" (Appeal to Jewish philanthropy/legacy).
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "anti-Israel BDS hate group", "defends anti-Semitism", "accused Jews of drinking blood", "eliminating Israel", "hate group", "attacking the existence of Israel", "perversion", "anti-Semitic narratives", "radical anti-Jewish", "blood libels", "destroy Israel", "corruption", "hate group linked to a literal blood libels".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Explicit comparison to Nazi Germany and Vichy collaboration: "When we think about Nazi Germany, we remember those who spoke out. We don’t remember those who were too intimidated... to rise against anti-Semitism"; Earlier reference to "Vichy journalism" in the technique list context reinforces this association.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Listing multiple AJHS Academic Council members who signed a pro-BDS petition ("include Ari Kelman, Riv-Ellen Prell, Deborah Dash Moore, Rachel Kranson, Libby Garland and Kirsten Fermaglich") implies a growing trend or consensus within the organization the reader should be concerned about.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The text presents a complex narrative of organizational capture and ideology but does not attribute a major complex event to a single, simple cause within this specific text.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and accusatory, not vague or obscure about its claims and targets.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – While figures like Leo Forchheimer (philanthropist) and Emma Lazarus (poet) are mentioned for their symbolic weight, their *authoritative opinions* on the current situation are not cited as evidence. The quoted authorities (like Kuttab, Herbst, Fishback) are used as examples of the opposition, not to support the author's argument.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – "Either you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews."; "when it comes to Israel, there’s only one perspective."; Implied throughout that supporting AJHS/JVP events means supporting the destruction of Israel and anti-Semitism.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – The text employs complex arguments and historical references rather than simplistic phrases designed to shut down thought. Phrases like "hate group" are loaded but used argumentatively, not as clichés terminating discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on the AJHS/JVP partnership, the speakers, and the alleged anti-Israel bias within these Jewish organizations. It does not introduce significantly irrelevant material to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks specific positions attributed to JVP, Kuttab, Herbst, Fishback, and the AJHS leadership (e.g., defending Hamas, supporting BDS, promoting a one-state solution, justifying terrorism, claiming Zionism dispossesses non-white Jews, claiming apolitical scholarship). While these positions are presented negatively, they are not misrepresented fabrications; they are based on quoted statements or documented affiliations.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text directly attacks the actions and views of AJHS, JVP, and associated individuals. It does not primarily charge its opponents with hypocrisy *instead* of addressing their arguments; it focuses on the arguments/actions themselves. (The mention of Trump avoiding military service in the technique example is a clearer instance of whataboutism).

**Verdict – 95% –** The text employs a significant number of established propaganda techniques very heavily throughout its argument. Its core strategy relies on **Name Calling** ("hate group", "anti-Semite"), **Loaded Language** ("destroy Israel", "blood libels", "perversion"), **Appeal to Fear** (Nazi Germany parallels, blacklisting, destruction of Israel), **Black & White Fallacy** (forced choice between supporting Israel/Jews or BDS/Hamas/anti-Semitism), **Bandwagon** (listing numerous anti-Israel council members), and **Repetition** (constant hammering of the AJHS-JVP partnership). It also uses **Reduction ad Hitlerum** (Nazi Germany comparison) and **Doubt** (questioning motives and neutrality). While it presents factual claims (event details, speaker quotes, organizational affiliations), these facts are framed, selected, and presented overwhelmingly through the lens of these manipulative techniques to provoke strong negative emotions (fear, outrage, disgust), demonize the opposition (JVP, speakers, AJHS leadership), oversimplify the conflict into absolute good vs. evil, and pressure the reader into a specific ideological stance against the AJHS/JVP events and their supporters. The sheer density and consistency of these techniques mark it as highly propagandistic. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of some factual basis, but the presentation is overwhelmingly propagandistic.
