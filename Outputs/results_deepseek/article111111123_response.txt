Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – No. No insulting labels are applied to Ellison, Monahan, the DFL, or the investigators.
2.  **Repetition** – No. The core message (investigation inconclusive, report sent to police, Ellison denies, Monahan criticizes) is stated clearly but not excessively repeated beyond necessary reporting.
3.  **Slogans** – No. No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans to encapsulate the message.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No. No attempt is made to instill fear about the consequences of believing or disbelieving either side.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes.** The lawyer's conclusion ("unable to substantiate") and the report's mention of Monahan's "shifting rationale" for not providing the video directly raise doubt about her allegations. *Example: "...unable to substantiate the accusations... because... ex-girlfriend refused to provide video..." and "...noted Monahan's shifting rationale for refusing to produce the video footage..."*
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No. The reporting states facts and claims without obvious exaggeration or minimization.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No. No appeal to patriotism or group identity is used.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes.** Monahan uses emotionally charged language in her tweets: "smeared, threatened, isolated," "healing from the abuse," "affirmed my humanity." *Example: "I've been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party."*
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No. No association with universally hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No. While noting Democrats supported Ford, it's not used to argue for supporting Monahan or disbelieving her.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No. The complexity of the situation (investigation challenges, political context) is acknowledged.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No. The reporting and statements are relatively clear about the findings and positions.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes.** The credibility of the investigation and its findings are emphasized by referencing the lawyer (Susan Ellingstad) and the DFL Chairman (Ken Martin). Ellison also uses the authority of the investigation's process. *Example: "A lawyer hired by Minnesota Democrats says...", "DFL Chairman Ken Martin said...", "Ellison thanked Ellingstad for conducting a 'thorough, independent, and fair review.'"*
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No. The text presents the complexity and lack of clear substantiation.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No. No phrases are used to shut down critical thought.
16. **Red herring** – No. While the Kavanaugh/Ford comparison is introduced by Monahan, it's directly relevant to her criticism of the DFL's response to *her* allegations and is not used to distract from the core issue of the investigation into Ellison.
17. **Straw men** – No. Arguments are represented fairly.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes.** Monahan explicitly accuses the DFL of hypocrisy by comparing their response to her allegations versus their response to Christine Blasey Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh. *Example: "Monahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations when compared to its treatment of Christine Blasey Ford." and "The fact that both parties only care if it scores political points is hypocritical."*

**Verdict – 15% –** While the text contains a few propaganda techniques (primarily **Doubt**, **Loaded Language** within quotes, **Appeal to Authority**, and **Whataboutism**), these techniques are largely confined to the *quoted statements* of the individuals involved (Monahan, the DFL lawyer/chairman, Ellison) rather than being the *overall framing* of the article itself. The article primarily reports facts: the investigation's inconclusive result, its handover to police, Ellison's denial, Monahan's allegations and criticisms, and the context of the Kavanaugh hearings. It presents multiple perspectives without overtly favoring one side through its own narrative voice. The presence of techniques within the quoted material reflects the arguments of the subjects, not necessarily the intent of the article to propagandize. Therefore, the text functions more as standard news reporting on a controversial situation than as propaganda, though the quoted individuals employ some propagandistic tactics.
