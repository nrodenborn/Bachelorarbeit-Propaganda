Name calling – Yes – The text uses the term "presstitutes" to attack the media, combining "press" and "prostitutes" into an insulting label. Example: "...politicians and presstitutes that it owns and controls..."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the phrase "military/security complex" to drill into the reader that this single entity is the source of the problems described. Example: The phrase is used 10 times, often at the start of a sentence to attribute blame, such as "The military/security complex orchestrated..."

Slogans – No – The text does not employ brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan. It uses longer, repetitive argumentative phrases instead.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns of a dire future if the described plot is not stopped, including the loss of democracy and freedom. Example: "If this plot succeeds, which is the most likely case, America will be a complete dystopia and all independent voices will be shut down."

Doubt – Yes – The text actively seeks to create doubt about official narratives and institutions. Example: "...the military/security complex orchestrated Russiagate, a proven hoax..."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the situation by framing a political disagreement over foreign policy as an act of treason. Example: "President Trump is accused of treason for trying to make peace!"

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a coup against a democratically elected leader and a threat to American democracy. Example: "...the military/security complex unfolds its coup against the elected president of the United States."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's perception. Example: "We are currently experiencing sedition at the highest levels..." and "The Tyranny of Good In..."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other groups hated by the target audience to discredit an idea.

Bandwagon – No – The text does the opposite of a bandwagon appeal; it suggests the reader would be part of a small, enlightened group (the "deplorables" and "independent voices") against a vast, powerful, and corrupt majority.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes multiple complex historical events (the assassination of JFK, the Watergate crisis, the current political tensions) to a single, simple cause. Example: "Shortly thereafter, the military/security complex assassinated President John F. Kennedy for working toward peace with Soviet leader Khrushchev."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The central antagonist, the "military/security complex," is presented as a monolithic entity that "owns," "controls," and "orchestrates" events without any specific details on how it operates, making it a vague and shadowy power. Example: The mechanism by which the complex "orchestrated the false indictments of 12 Russians" is never explained.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites a former president to lend credibility to its central claim. Example: "In 1961 President Dwight Eisenhower warned Americans in his last public address that the military/industrial complex was a threat to American democracy."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a situation with only two possible, extreme outcomes. Example: "Once Putin and Lavrov realize the true situation, they will understand that war or surrender is their only option."

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down discussion; instead, it uses strong, unsupported assertions presented as fact.

Red herring – No – The text remains highly focused on its central conspiracy theory and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the audience.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an opposing argument. It simply presents its own narrative as the absolute truth, largely ignoring any counter-arguments.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an opponent by charging them with hypocrisy. It makes direct accusations of conspiracy and sedition.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or present a balanced argument, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, conspiratorial worldview by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques.

The piece is built on a foundation of **Causal Oversimplification**, attributing decades of complex geopolitical events and domestic political conflicts to a single, vaguely defined entity: the "military/security complex." This simplifies reality into a good-versus-evil narrative. It heavily relies on **Appeal to Fear**, warning of a "dystopia," "nuclear war," and a "coup" to create a sense of urgency and panic.

Throughout the text, **Loaded Language** ("sedition," "tyranny," "presstitutes") and **Name Calling** are used to evoke strong emotional responses rather than rational analysis. The central claim is reinforced through constant **Repetition** of the term "military/security complex." The author creates **Doubt** about all established institutions (government, media, political parties) while using an **Appeal to Authority** (Eisenhower) to lend credibility to their own claims. Finally, it presents a **Black & White Fallacy**, suggesting the only outcomes are total victory or total disaster ("war or surrender"), which serves to eliminate nuance and pressure the reader into accepting the author's dire framing. The combination of these techniques is designed to bypass critical thought and instill a specific belief system, which is the fundamental goal of propaganda.
