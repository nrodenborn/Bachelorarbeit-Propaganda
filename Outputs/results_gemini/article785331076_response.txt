1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses the label “blue privilege” to attack the perceived special treatment given to the police officer.
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that the officer killed an innocent man and was not arrested is repeated multiple times. For example, the headline states “Kills Innocent Homeowner—Not Arrested,” and the body of the text reiterates, “And, she has not yet been arrested,” and later, “the person who admitted to killing their innocent son has yet to be arrested.” The poll about Nikki Haley is also repeated three times.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The article includes a quote from a neighbor saying the situation is “super scary because the police are supposed to protect you and then they come home and, you know, you’re just hanging out in your own house... that’s pretty scary,” which is intended to instill fear in the reader about their own safety from police.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the fairness of the justice system by stating, “If an average citizen walked into the wrong home and shot and killed an innocent homeowner, rest assured that they would be in jail—right now,” questioning the credibility of the process applied to the officer.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The article uses exaggeration in its opening line: “Highlighting the sheer insane state of law enforcement in America today is a tragic story out of Dallas this week.” The phrase “sheer insane state” is an exaggeration.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its case.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged language to influence the reader, such as “tragic story,” “innocent homeowner,” and describing the lack of an arrest as a “slap in the face of Jean’s parents.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The article does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests the simple cause for the officer not being arrested is “blue privilege,” which oversimplifies the complex legal and procedural steps involved in an officer-involved shooting investigation.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article’s own writing is direct and not intentionally vague; it aims to make a clear point rather than confuse the reader.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does not use the support of an authority figure as evidence for its own claims. It quotes the police only to critique their statement.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The article presents the situation as having only two outcomes: the officer is either arrested immediately (the "average citizen" option) or she is given preferential treatment (the "blue privilege" option), ignoring other potential complexities and procedures in the legal process.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “blue privilege” is used as a thought-terminating cliché. It provides a simple, emotionally resonant explanation that discourages deeper critical thought about the specific legal standards and procedures at play.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll, “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?”, which is entirely irrelevant to the topic of the article and serves to distract the reader and collect user data.
17. Straw men – No – The article focuses on presenting its own narrative and does not construct and refute a weak counter-argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text is making a direct accusation of a double standard, not deflecting a criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it reports on a factual event, its primary purpose is not objective journalism but to persuade the audience to adopt a specific, highly critical viewpoint of law enforcement. This is achieved through the heavy use of propaganda techniques. The article employs loaded language (“tragic,” “innocent,” “slap in the face”) and exaggeration (“sheer insane state”) to create an emotional response. It uses logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy to frame the situation as a simple case of injustice versus justice, and causal oversimplification by attributing the outcome solely to “blue privilege.” The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring poll about a U.N. ambassador further demonstrates that the article's purpose extends beyond informing the public, likely into data collection and audience engagement for a specific agenda. The combination of emotional manipulation, logical fallacies, and a clear, biased narrative framework makes this a strong example of propaganda.
