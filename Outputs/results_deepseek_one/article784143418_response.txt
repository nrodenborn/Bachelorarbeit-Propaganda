### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "enemedia" (insulting label for mainstream media).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" repeated 3 times in the poll.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Raise An Army" and "Killing Non-Believers On Behalf Of Allah" (memorable phrases in the headline/subheaders).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Descriptions of jihad training, "killing non-believers," and a child's body being found instill fear.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "The enemedia is scrubbing and censoring this story" questions media credibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – The text cites FBI affidavits; no clear exaggeration/minimization beyond the headline's dramatic phrasing.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No overt appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "jihad slaughter," "squalid compound," "exorcism rituals" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to the popularity of an idea.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – No oversimplified causes for complex events.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Details are specific (e.g., FBI affidavits, court documents).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Repeated reliance on FBI affidavits and court documents as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Partial** – Implied dichotomy between "jihadists" and constitutional rights defense, but not explicitly stated.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" to shut down discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The Nikki Haley poll distracts from the main story (irrelevant to the compound narrative).  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The defense’s "religious freedom" argument is cited accurately, not misrepresented.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy against critics.

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs multiple manipulative techniques:  
- **Emotional Manipulation:** Loaded language ("jihad slaughter," "squalid compound") and fear appeals frame the story sensationally.  
- **Distortion of Opposition:** Name-calling ("enemedia") and doubt-casting discredit dissenting voices without evidence.  
- **Repetition & Slogans:** Redundant polling and hyperbolic headlines ("Raise An Army") reinforce a narrative.  
- **Irrelevant Content:** The Nikki Haley poll acts as a red herring, diverting attention.  
- **Selective Authority:** While citing FBI documents lends credibility, the framing (e.g., headline) exaggerates affidavits into clickbait.  
The article’s structure—burying factual reporting (Reuters) between inflammatory commentary and distractions—aims to provoke outrage against Muslims and the media. This aligns with propaganda’s core goal: advancing an agenda (e.g., anti-Islam, anti-media narratives) over balanced discourse. The 10% uncertainty stems from partial reliance on verified sources (FBI), though their contextualization remains manipulative.
