Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in "The Eerie Silence":

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Russia-gate frenzy" (targeting Adam Schiff), "Russia-gate freaks" (targeting Adam Schiff and Mike Pompeo), "dark and menacing developments" (targeting opponents/trends).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The concept of "silence" regarding Assange is repeated throughout the text ("The silence is Julian Assange", "eerie silence", "silence among many", "silence of good people", "silence about Julian").
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: "demand justice and free speech for Julian" functions as a memorable call to action.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Warns that "Only the silence of good people will allow them to win" and describes potential outcomes like Assange being arrested, extradited, and ending "in a hell hole".
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Questions the credibility of mainstream media ("so-called mainstream", Pulitzer Prize for "witch-hunting"), the British government (betraying UN ruling), and the "Russia-gate" narrative ("turned up not a shred of real evidence").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggerates the benefits media gained from WikiLeaks ("huge media organizations which have drawn great benefit") and minimizes the validity of the "Russia-gate" narrative and charges against Assange ("ridiculous", "ludicrous", "farcical").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to principles like "justice", "freedom of speech", "our right to know", and specifically references the US Constitution ("enshrined in the United States Constitution", "constitutional hero").
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Pervasive use of emotionally charged language: "eerie silence", "bogus smear", "rapacious power", "fakery", "shame", "vindictive delight", "tormenting", "torture", "betrayed", "hell hole", "wickedly experimental munitions", "persecution", "brutalized", "dark and menacing", "blighted", "subversion".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: While critical of governments/media, the text does not compare opponents or their ideas to Nazis or Hitler specifically.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not argue that supporting Assange is good because it's popular; it laments the *lack* of popular support ("silence", "streets... empty").
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Attributes the leaks damaging the DNC solely to "pissed-off people" within the Clinton machine/DNC who wanted to get rid of Sanders, ignoring other potential factors or complexities ("And yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so pissed-off people who went to work for the Clinton machine and learned from the inside that the DNC was all about getting rid of Bernie Sanders…this is not a part of the story!").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is generally direct in its criticisms and arguments, even if biased. Terms like "them", "they", or "great power" are contextually clear.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Relies heavily on the authority and statements of John Pilger as a respected journalist and Assange supporter, and cites Rafael Correa ("Rafael Correa... said recently that he regarded what they are doing to Julian now as torture"). Also references the UN Working Party.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents the situation as a binary choice between supporting Assange/truth/free speech ("demand justice", "rally to") or being complicit through silence ("Only the silence of good people will allow them to win").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses phrases like "everybody knows that this is the story" and "The principles involved in this case are absolutely clear-cut" to shut down potential counter-arguments or complexities.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: The extended discussion about Israel/Palestine ("ultimate collusion", "gunning down", "Nakba", "immunity") diverts attention from the primary focus on Assange and media silence, introducing a tangentially related issue about media bias/collusion.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text argues against actual positions held by Assange's critics (e.g., Russian collusion, justification for prosecution, media narratives) rather than misrepresenting them.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Explanation: Deflects criticism of Assange/WikiLeaks by pointing to the hypocrisy or worse actions of others: "what about Judith Miller and The New York Times lying the West into war?" Contrasts Assange's treatment with Gary Webb's and Edward Snowden's.

**Verdict – 70% – Explanation:** The text extensively employs recognized propaganda techniques. While based on real events and genuine concerns regarding Julian Assange and press freedom, its presentation is heavily biased and manipulative. It uses **Name Calling**, **Repetition**, **Slogans**, **Appeal to Fear**, **Doubt**, **Exaggeration/Minimization**, **Flag-Waving**, **Loaded Language**, **Appeal to Authority**, **Black & White Fallacy**, **Thought-Terminating Clichés**, **Red Herring**, **Causal Oversimplification**, and **Whataboutism** to frame the narrative, vilify opponents (Schiff, Pompeo, mainstream media, British govt, Moreno govt), evoke strong emotions (fear, outrage, sympathy), discourage critical analysis of its own claims, and rally support for Assange. The purpose is clearly persuasive advocacy, presenting a singular, emotionally charged perspective while dismissing or attacking alternatives. The factual core exists, but it is packaged and presented using the tools of propaganda.
