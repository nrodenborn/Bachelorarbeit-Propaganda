Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "jihad terror", "jihadist intimidation", "appeasement-minded government". These are insulting labels applied to the subjects.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The core message about banning activists while admitting preachers/terrorists is repeated multiple times (e.g., "just the latest of many, many examples", "meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record", "Nor does the UK admit only preachers...", "It admits jihad terrorists as well").
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "bowing to jihadist intimidation" is a brief, memorable phrase encapsulating the accusation against the UK government.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text repeatedly emphasizes the danger posed by admitted "jihad preachers" and "jihad terrorists" (e.g., quotes advocating violence against homosexuals, admitting someone who confessed ISIS training, praising murderers), implying the UK is endangered by this policy while silencing those who warn about it.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The text consistently questions the credibility and motives of the UK government and Home Office (e.g., "bowing to jihadist intimidation", "relentlessly appeasement-minded government", implying their reasons for banning activists are false pretexts).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – *Exaggeration*: "steadily lengthening record", "many, many examples", "relentlessly appeasement-minded". *Minimization*: Downplaying the reasons given for banning activists ("just what they claimed", implying it's not valid).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While it criticizes the government's actions as harmful, it doesn't explicitly appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its *own* position. It portrays the government as acting *against* national interests.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Pervasive use of highly charged, emotional, and negatively connotative language: "jihad terror", "foes", "proponents", "hatred", "hardline", "appeasement-minded", "jihadist intimidation", "murderer".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Hitler or the Nazis is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text doesn't argue that the reader should agree because the view is popular. It argues based on perceived injustice and danger.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes the UK's admission of controversial figures and banning of activists *solely* to "appeasement" and "bowing to jihadist intimidation", ignoring potential complex legal, diplomatic, or security considerations.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – While it makes strong claims, the examples given (Sellner/Pettibone, Geller/Spencer, Qadri, Sodagar, the two praising murderers, the ISIS-trained teen, the bishops) are relatively specific instances used to support the argument. The core accusation is clear.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – The only cited source is Breitbart for a Sellner quote, and the article is posted by Robert Spencer. Neither is presented as an authoritative source whose endorsement alone validates the claims; the argument relies more on the presented examples and rhetoric.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the UK government's choices as only two options: ban "foes of jihad terror" (activists) or admit "proponents" (preachers/terrorists). Ignores the possibility of nuanced decisions or other categories of individuals.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "bowing to jihadist intimidation" and "appeasement-minded government" are used as definitive explanations that shut down further critical analysis of the government's complex motivations or decision-making processes.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The mention of banning "three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted" is introduced suddenly. While potentially another example of perceived inconsistency, it shifts focus away from the core argument about activists vs. jihad preachers/terrorists onto a different religious persecution issue without clear connection to the main thesis within the text.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Characterizes the UK government's stated reason for banning activists ("could cause violence and disrupt community cohesion") as *only* meaning "our visit could cause violence from Muslims" and then dismisses this as "bowing to jihadist intimidation". This reframes the government's stated concern (potential public disorder/community tension, which could involve multiple parties) into a much narrower and easily attacked position (capitulating to specific threats).
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – The core argument relies heavily on this: Charging the UK government with hypocrisy for banning activists ("for the crime of telling the truth") while admitting preachers of hatred/violence and terrorists ("But we... have never advocated or approved of any violence. ...Meanwhile, Britain has... admitted jihad preachers...").

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a very high concentration of identifiable propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is not balanced reporting but to persuade through emotional manipulation (fear, outrage), simplification (black & white fallacy, causal oversimplification), character attacks (name-calling, loaded language), and fallacious reasoning (straw man, whataboutism). It selectively presents examples to support a pre-determined narrative of government hypocrisy and appeasement towards a perceived threat ("jihad"), while dismissing alternative viewpoints or complexities. The reliance on charged language, repetition of the core accusation, and the clear intent to discredit the UK government's actions and motives overwhelmingly indicate propaganda. The near absence of counter-evidence or nuanced analysis further supports this assessment.
