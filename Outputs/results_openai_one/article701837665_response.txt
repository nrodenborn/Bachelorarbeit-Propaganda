### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda.**

**Explanation:**  
The text employs a wide range of propaganda techniques, including repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, black & white fallacy, thought-terminating clichés, red herrings, straw men, and whataboutism. It repeatedly questions the credibility of official sources and presents a speculative, conspiratorial narrative as virtually certain. The language is emotionally charged and designed to provoke skepticism and distrust toward the government and mainstream media, while offering little concrete evidence. The use of authority figures, vague assertions, and rhetorical questions further manipulates the reader’s perception. The overwhelming presence of these techniques, and the lack of balanced argumentation, strongly indicate that the text is propaganda.
