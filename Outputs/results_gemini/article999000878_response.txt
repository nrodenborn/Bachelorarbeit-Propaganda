1. Name calling – Yes – The poll option “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass” labels Acosta's behavior as childish.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?” is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text encourages readers to sign up for “Truth Uncensored” updates, which acts as a slogan for the source of the article.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear in the audience about the consequences of an alternative outcome.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text states, “Acosta has disputed the accusation claiming he never put his hands on the young woman,” and then immediately counters it with, “Watching the full exchange it is obvious that…” which is intended to cast doubt on Acosta’s version of events.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text describes Trump as making a “sincere effort to answer Acosta’s questions,” which minimizes the president’s own confrontational role in the exchange. It also describes Acosta as having “forcefully push[ed] the female interns arm away,” which exaggerates the action.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – Phrases like “act like a child,” “vicious attacks,” “rightfully losing his patients,” and “forcefully push” are used to evoke an emotional response rather than a rational one.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or other groups widely hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the reason for the press pass revocation to a single event: “he used his hand to forcefully push the female interns arm away from the mic,” ignoring the complex legal and political context of the situation.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its claims and opinions, particularly in the final paragraph. It does not use intentionally vague language to confuse.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites “ABC’s former White House correspondent Sam Donaldson” and “constitutional lawyer Floyd Mayweather” to lend credibility to its points.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents the main options as a simple binary choice, with one option being heavily loaded: “Yes, he should have gotten it back” versus “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass.” The final paragraph also frames the incident as Trump being right and Acosta being wrong, with no room for nuance.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The poll option “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass” is a simplistic, cliché-like statement that discourages deeper thought about the principles of press freedom and conduct.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text brings up Sam Donaldson’s history of “trading personal insults with President George Bush in 2006.” This is irrelevant to the Acosta incident and serves to distract by drawing a parallel to a past confrontation.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent an opponent's argument in order to refute it. It primarily presents its own biased narrative.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing the other side of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda disguised as a news report. While the initial paragraphs report on the potential lawsuit with some factual basis (citing sources like Sam Donaldson and CNN), the piece quickly devolves into a persuasive text designed to manipulate the reader's opinion. The interactive poll is a blatant propaganda tool, using repetition, name-calling, loaded language, and a black-and-white fallacy to frame the issue and guide the user to a specific conclusion. The final paragraphs abandon any pretense of objectivity, presenting a highly subjective interpretation of the event as fact ("it is obvious," "sincere effort," "rightfully losing his patients"). It uses causal oversimplification to blame Acosta entirely and concludes with a definitive, thought-terminating judgment: "He deserved to have his credentials revoked." The combination of these numerous techniques demonstrates that the article's primary goal is not to inform, but to indoctrinate the reader into a specific anti-Acosta/CNN viewpoint.
