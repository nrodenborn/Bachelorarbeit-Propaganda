1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels for its subjects, such as "Illegal Alien ‘Caravan’", "border-crashers", and "Crooked Hillary".
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the core message that Trump is fulfilling his promises, stating "Trump will find other ways to secure our Southern border as he had promised to do," "Trump is still keeping promises," "The economy is doing exactly what he promised it would," and concluding with the hashtag "#PromisesKept".
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases to rally support, such as "#PromisesKept" and the borrowed slogan, "He’ll be back."
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by describing "migrants taunting security forces" and "border-crashers that pushed their way into Mexico," creating a sense of threat that the new razor wire is meant to prevent.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively questions the credibility of others, stating, "The Fake News is showing old footage of people climbing over our Ocean Area Fence" and dismissing media reports as "little fever dreams".
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates Trump's resilience by labeling him "The Trumpinator" and exaggerates the failure of his opponents by claiming CNN's "ratings are now circling the toilet."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of national and group identity by framing the issue around securing "our Southern border" and calling on "Happy Warriors" to fight against "Leftism".
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language to influence the audience, with phrases like "border-crashers," "fever dreams," and "kick in to our ‘war chest’".
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text encourages readers to join a movement by stating, "We’re also moving onto a new platform, MeWe... Sign up and you can still get all the ClashDaily goodness by joining our MeWe group."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex event by stating, "The economy is doing exactly what he promised it would," attributing the state of the entire economy solely to one person's actions.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct, aggressive, and clear in its messaging; it does not use vague or obscure expressions to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the President's authority as evidence, quoting him directly to "prove" the border fence situation: "Here’s what the President said with the photo: 'This is what it really looks like – no climbers anymore under our Administration!'"
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a world of only two sides: the pro-Trump "Happy Warriors" versus everyone else ("Fake News," "Leftism," "Crooked Hillary," "border-crashers"), implying there are no other options or nuances.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the hashtag "#PromisesKept" as a simple, final phrase that discourages any critical thought or discussion about the nuances of the policies mentioned.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces irrelevant material to distract from the main topic of the border wire. It pivots to a list of Trump's past political victories ("He knocked out Crooked Hillary. He beat CNN... Mueller and the Dossier aren’t just coming up empty...") to rally support rather than discuss the policy itself.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that was not necessarily presented by characterizing media coverage as "little fever dreams about cross-border gun battles," an easily dismissed caricature of what was likely more complex reporting.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text attacks opponents directly but does not use the specific tactic of deflecting criticism by accusing the opponent of hypocrisy for a similar action.

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. It employs an overwhelming majority (15 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques to promote a political agenda. Its purpose is not to inform but to persuade, inflame, and mobilize a specific audience. The piece systematically uses name-calling ("Illegal Alien," "Fake News") and loaded language ("border-crashers") to dehumanize and delegitimize opponents. It creates a stark black-and-white, "us vs. them" worldview, pitting "Happy Warriors" against a monolithic "Leftism." The author relies heavily on emotional appeals, such as fear of migrants and patriotic appeals to secure "our" border. Opposing viewpoints are not engaged with honestly but are dismissed using doubt, straw men, and red herrings. The entire article culminates in a direct call to action for financial contributions ("war chest") and ideological recruitment (joining their newsletter and MeWe group), which is a hallmark of organized propaganda campaigns.
