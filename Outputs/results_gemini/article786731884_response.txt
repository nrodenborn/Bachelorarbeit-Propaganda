1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Facebook's leadership as "Unholy Alliance masters" and Glazov's opponents as "totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces." The subject of Glazov's book is labeled the "Jihadist Psychopath."
2. Repetition – Yes – The central idea that Facebook is unjustly censoring content aimed at preventing jihad, and that this action is "totalitarian," is repeated throughout the article. The phrase "community standards" is mentioned multiple times, often in a sarcastic or critical context.
3. Slogans – Yes – The title of Glazov's book, "Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us," is used as a memorable, impactful phrase to encapsulate the threat.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns of "jihadist attacks on Americans," "another 9/11," and "skyrocketing jihadist stabbings in Europe" to create fear and urgency for the author's proposed solutions.
5. Doubt – Yes – The article repeatedly questions the legitimacy and motives behind Facebook's "community standards," suggesting they are a pretext for a politically motivated agenda: "Somewhere in the 'community standards' that Facebook demands everyone follow is a real doozy."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses phrases like "totalitarian suffocation of free thought" and compares the situation to a "harrowing Stalinist sense," which are significant exaggerations of a social media suspension.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a defense of "Americans" from "jihadi attacks" and protecting "our civilization" and the "U.S. Constitution."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like "Jihadist Psychopath," "totalitarian plantation," "enslaved," "Shariah barbarities," and "Unholy Alliance masters" to evoke strong emotional responses rather than rational thought.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text uses a variation of this by comparing Facebook's actions to a "harrowing Stalinist sense." For the intended audience, Stalinism is a hated totalitarian ideology, and the comparison is meant to discredit Facebook by association.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its ideas are correct because they are popular. In fact, it frames its subject, Jamie Glazov, as a brave individual standing against powerful entities like Facebook and a silent culture.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex reasons for a social media ban by asserting a single, sinister cause: "Facebook’s Unholy Alliance masters are, without doubt, accelerating their totalitarian suffocation of free thought and expression."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague or obscure; its accusations against Facebook are direct and clear, even if they are hyperbolic.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents Jamie Glazov as an "author and commentator" and editor, and cites Bill Maher as an authority who has "set a bold standard" for the type of ridicule the article advocates.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The article presents a world of two choices: either you support Glazov's methods for countering jihad, or you are on the side of "Shariah enforcers and oppressors of Muslim women and girls."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like "Shariah barbarities" and "totalitarian suffocation of free thought" are used to end nuanced discussion. They present a complex topic in such extreme, emotionally-charged terms that any counter-argument is framed as defending the indefensible.
16. Red herring – Yes – While discussing Glazov's ban, the article introduces the topic of a "shameful silence in our culture’s sphere of comedy" and brings up Bill Maher. This shifts the focus from the specific Facebook action to a broader, less directly related cultural critique.
17. Straw men – Yes – The article sets up the straw man argument that Facebook is against "daring to give suggestions on how our civilization can stop jihadist attacks" and against "supporting moderate Muslims." It then attacks this position, rather than engaging with the likely, more complex reasons for the ban related to specific hate speech policies.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism of Glazov by accusing Facebook of hypocrisy on an unrelated or different issue. Its focus is a direct attack on the specific action of banning Glazov.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. It employs an overwhelming majority of the listed techniques (15 out of 18) to construct a one-sided and emotionally manipulative narrative. Rather than presenting a balanced news report, the article's primary purpose is to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint by demonizing an opponent (Facebook) and creating a sense of crisis and fear.

The piece relies heavily on Loaded Language ("totalitarian plantation," "Shariah barbarities"), Name Calling ("Unholy Alliance masters"), and Exaggeration ("harrowing Stalinist sense") to bypass rational analysis and provoke an emotional response. It frames a complex issue of content moderation using a Black & White Fallacy, presenting only two options: siding with the heroic author against jihad or siding with the villainous "totalitarian" corporation that allegedly supports oppressors. The use of logical fallacies like Causal Oversimplification and Straw Man further demonstrates that the article's goal is not to inform, but to indoctrinate the reader into a specific ideological position by misrepresenting the opponent's actions and motives. The consistent appeal to fear and patriotism solidifies its nature as a piece of propaganda designed to rally support for a cause and incite anger against a perceived enemy.
