1. Name calling – No – The text reports that Patel’s jokes were “criticized as racist and homophobic” and “deemed inappropriate,” but the author of the text does not use these labels themselves. It is reporting on the accusations, not making them.

2. Repetition – No – The text presents a sequence of events and different viewpoints without repeating a specific message.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.

4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear in the reader.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text shows the event organizers (AAA) questioning the appropriateness of Patel's comedy, and Patel, in turn, questioning their judgment. Example: "Patel pushed back on the officials’ remarks, and said that while he stood in solidarity with Asian American identities, none of his remarks were offensive, and he was exposing the audience to ideas that would be found 'in the real world.'"

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Audience member Elle Ferguson minimizes the impact of the jokes. Example: "none of them were jokes that I hadn’t heard before and none of them were jokes that elicited such a response in my experience."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The conflict is framed around group identity. The event itself is for the "Columbia Asian American Alliance" and Patel states he "stood in solidarity with Asian American identities." Example: "cultureSHOCK... aims to provide a platform for Asian American artistic expression."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text reports on the use of emotionally charged and stereotypical language. Example: The joke itself relies on stereotypes ("this black thing is too easy"), and the criticism uses loaded terms like "racist" and "homophobic."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – There is no comparison of any idea or person to hated groups like Nazis.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – An audience member appeals to the commonality of the jokes within the comedy world to suggest they are acceptable. Example: "as someone who watches comedy a lot, none of them were jokes that I hadn’t heard before."

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – A student simplifies the complex issue of offensive speech into a simple generational conflict. Example: "I really dislike when people who are older say that our generation needs to be exposed to the real world... When older generations say you need to stop being so sensitive, it’s like undermining what our generation is trying to do."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is a news report that aims for clarity, even providing the specific joke that caused the controversy.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text establishes Nimesh Patel's credibility and authority as a professional comedian by listing his credentials. Example: "Patel, 32, was the first Indian-American writer for SNL, and has since been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing."

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – A student presents the situation as a binary choice between perpetuating an "unsafe" world or trying to change it. Example: "Obviously the world is not a safe space but just accepting that it’s not and continuing to perpetuate the un-safeness of it… is saying that it can’t be changed."

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text reports Patel using a cliché to dismiss the students' concerns. Example: Patel's argument that he was exposing the audience to ideas that would be found "in the real world."

16. Red herring – No – The arguments and quotes presented in the text remain relevant to the central conflict of the comedian being removed from the stage.

17. Straw men – Yes – A student reframes Patel's specific argument about the "real world" into a more general, easier-to-attack argument. Example: "When older generations say you need to stop being so sensitive, it’s like undermining what our generation is trying to do." This refutes a common trope rather than Patel's exact point.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain any instances of a person deflecting criticism by accusing their opponent of hypocrisy on another matter.

Verdict – 10% – This text is a news report, not a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about an event that occurred, not to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint. While the text contains many examples of propaganda techniques, these techniques are used by the *people being quoted in the article* (Patel, the students) as they argue their respective positions in the conflict. The author of the article, however, maintains a neutral, journalistic tone. The article demonstrates balance by: 1) stating the facts of the event, 2) providing Patel's credentials and his on-stage defense, 3) explaining the organizers' position and the event's purpose, and 4) including multiple, conflicting viewpoints from different audience members (Warren, Ferguson, and Jao). The structure is that of objective reporting on a contentious issue, not a propagandistic attempt to push an agenda. The low percentage accounts for any potential, subtle bias in the selection and framing of quotes.
