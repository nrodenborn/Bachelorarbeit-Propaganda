Name calling – Yes – The text labels Kyrsten Sinema and others who share her perceived views as "Useful Idiots".

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated three times consecutively.

Slogans – No – The text does not employ any brief, memorable phrases intended to be repeated as a rallying cry.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text repeatedly references "jihad terror," "terror attacks," and "jihad mass murder plotting," linking a political candidate to these concepts to create fear and alarm.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to cast doubt on Kyrsten Sinema's patriotism and fitness for office by highlighting past statements and associations.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text makes the sweeping and unsubstantiated claim that "the Left hates America," which is a significant exaggeration.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text contrasts the subject's alleged views with those of "American patriots," framing the issue as a matter of national loyalty.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases such as "Useful Idiots," "jihad mass murder plotting," and "Blind Sheikh" to provoke an emotional response from the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular; instead, it frames itself as a truth that is only now "becoming increasingly clear."

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents the simple causal claim: "If you don’t recognize the reality, nature, and magnitude of the jihad threat, you may well end up abetting the jihad. Sinema is proof." This reduces a complex political stance to a direct cause for supporting terrorism.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text's accusations, while based on interpretation, are direct and its overall message is not deliberately unclear.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites "Fox News" as its source ("Fox News reported...") and is presented under the authority of the author, "Robert Spencer," to lend credibility to its claims.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false choice: either one agrees with the author's view on the "jihad threat" or one is a "Useful Idiot" who "hates America." The poll also presents only two options for a complex issue: "Yes, military force should be used" or "No, keep the military out of it."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The statement "the Left hates America" is presented as a conclusive fact, intended to end nuanced discussion and dismiss an entire political spectrum.

Red herring – Yes – The text inserts a poll about using military force on a "caravan of migrants," an issue completely unrelated to Kyrsten Sinema's 2003 comments, in order to distract and introduce another source of fear and anger.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the opposing viewpoint by claiming, "The Left maintains that Islamic jihad terror is not a problem — it’s just a reaction to the evil deeds of the U.S. and Israel." This creates a distorted and easily attackable version of the opposition's argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy on another matter.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of a political candidate and a broad political group ("The Left"). It achieves this by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques in concert. The piece relies heavily on an appeal to fear by constantly invoking terrorism and linking it to the candidate. It uses loaded language ("Useful Idiots," "jihad mass murder") and name-calling to demonize its targets. It builds a straw man of "The Left's" position to make it seem unreasonable and presents a black & white fallacy where disagreement with the author is equated with hating America. Crucially, it introduces a red herring (the migrant caravan poll) to conflate issues and amplify fear and anger. The combination of these techniques, aimed at manipulating emotion and bypassing rational analysis, is the hallmark of propaganda.
