Here are the propaganda techniques and whether they are used in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text uses the label "neocons" to attack a political group associated with the Iraq War: "Iraq, which George W. Bush and the neocons were going to fashion into a pro-Western democracy and American ally..."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly raises the question of whether the US should engage in a new war, creating a recurring theme of a difficult and potentially disastrous choice: "Do we accept that outcome, pack up and go home? Or do we leave our forces in Syria and Iraq...?", "Would President Trump be willing to fight a new war...?", "Would the American people support such a war...?"

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to rally support for its own position.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by highlighting negative potential outcomes, such as quoting the Washington Post's warning of "more war, the rise of new terrorist threats, and, ultimately, the necessity of more U.S. intervention."

Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the success and wisdom of U.S. policy and leadership: "But if our victory in the war against ISIS leaves Iran in the catbird seat in Baghdad and Damascus... is that really a victory?"

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to describe a military outcome: "The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, largely Kurdish, just annihilated ISIS in Raqqa..."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by highlighting the costs of war to the nation: "After 4,500 U.S. dead, scores of thousands wounded and a trillion dollars sunk, our 15-year war in Iraq could end with a Shiite-dominated Baghdad aligned with Tehran."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's perception: "More troubling for America is the new reality revealed by the rout of the peshmerga." and describing the potential outcome as a "grim prospect."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to the Nazis or other universally hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not offer a simple cause for a complex event; instead, it emphasizes the complexity of the situation.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's writing is direct and his questions are pointed, not deliberately unclear or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The author quotes authorities like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and The Washington Post to lend weight to his arguments: "Sunday's editorial in The Washington Post, 'The Next Mideast Wars,' raises the crucial questions now before us."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by suggesting only two possible outcomes: "Confront Assad and Iran now, or fight them later."

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text is designed to provoke critical thought through questioning, not shut it down with clichés.

Red herring – No – The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main argument.

Straw men – No – The text engages with real statements and events rather than misrepresenting or inventing arguments to refute.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not try to deflect criticism by accusing others of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 85% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While presented as a political analysis, it systematically employs a significant number of propaganda techniques to promote a specific, non-interventionist viewpoint. The author uses emotional appeals such as **Appeal to Fear** (warning of new wars) and **Flag-Waving** (invoking the high cost in American lives and money) to connect with the reader on a visceral level. The argument is framed with **Loaded Language** ("rout," "grim prospect") and **Name Calling** ("neocons") to create a negative association with past and potential future intervention. Furthermore, it uses logical fallacies like the **Black & White Fallacy** ("Confront... now, or fight them later") to narrow the perceived options and guide the reader toward the author's desired conclusion. The pervasive use of **Doubt** serves to undermine confidence in current and past U.S. foreign policy. The combination of these techniques indicates a clear intent to persuade through emotional manipulation and skewed framing rather than through balanced, objective reasoning.
