Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "absolutely disgusting cesspool of filth and corruption" (insulting label applied to the government).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The phrase "drain the swamp" is repeated (in the main text and the permission footer).
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "drain the swamp" is a brief, memorable political slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text emphasizes sexual harassment and assault by powerful figures (Franken, Clinton, Biden) and the pervasive "culture of corruption," instilling fear about the state of Washington D.C. to support the call to action.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "the mainstream media nearly really talks about any of it" (questions media credibility). "if even half of their allegations are true Clinton should be in prison" (casts doubt on Clinton's innocence).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: "absolutely disgusting cesspool of filth and corruption", "far worse offenders". Minimization: Downplaying Franken's comedy background justification ("But just because he was a comedian does not mean...").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – While patriotism is implied in "take our government back," the primary appeals are to outrage and anti-establishment sentiment, not explicitly to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Pervasive use: "sick things," "rampant," "forcibly kissed," "groped," "violated," "humiliated," "creepy manner," "drugging and raping," "appalled," "crimes," "Weinstein-level," "culture of corruption," "drain the swamp," "cesspool of filth and corruption". These words evoke strong negative emotions and stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No attempt to link opponents/ideas to universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "I hope that you will support my campaign and the campaigns of other anti-establishment candidates" (appeal to join a popular-sounding movement).
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes the complex problems in Washington D.C. simplistically to a single cause needing a single solution: "culture of corruption" solved by electing "anti-establishment candidates" to "drain the swamp".
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and uses highly charged, specific language. It doesn't rely on vagueness.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – While sources are cited (Breitbart, Fox News, individuals), the arguments don't primarily rely on citing an authority figure's support as the core evidence for a claim. The sources are presented as evidence providers.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as only two options: the current corrupt government vs. electing anti-establishment candidates to "clean up" and "take our government back". Ignores nuance, other solutions, or the complexity of governance.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "drain the swamp" and "take our government back" are simplistic, emotionally charged phrases that summarize the problem and solution, discouraging deeper critical analysis.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The lengthy diversion into Bill Clinton's alleged history and Joe Biden's alleged behavior shifts focus away from the initial subject (Al Franken) and the core call to action (supporting the author's campaign) by introducing other alleged offenders. This distracts from Franken's specific case and the campaign pitch.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks Franken, Clinton, Biden, and the establishment based on presented allegations and characterizations. It doesn't explicitly misrepresent an opponent's argument to refute it.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Explicitly shifts focus from Al Franken's actions to Bill Clinton's alleged actions: "As much as we may be appalled by some of the things that Al Franken has done, the truth is that there are far worse offenders in Washington. Let’s talk about Bill Clinton for a moment." This charges opponents (Democrats covering for Clinton) with hypocrisy regarding holding Franken accountable.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of classic propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is not balanced reporting on the Al Franken scandal, but to leverage that scandal (and others involving Clinton/Biden) to evoke outrage and fear ("Appeal to fear," "Loaded Language"), promote a simplistic "us vs. them" narrative ("Black & white fallacy," "Name calling"), discredit opponents and the system ("Doubt," "Causal Oversimplification"), and recruit support for a specific political agenda ("Bandwagon," "Slogans," "Repetition" of "drain the swamp"). Techniques like "Red herring" and "Whataboutism" are used to broaden the attack beyond Franken. The consistent use of emotionally charged, non-neutral language ("Loaded Language," "Thought-terminating clichés") and the direct call to action for political support confirm its propagandistic intent. While based on real events (the Franken allegations), the framing, selective emphasis, diversionary tactics, and highly inflammatory language overwhelmingly serve a persuasive political purpose characteristic of propaganda.
