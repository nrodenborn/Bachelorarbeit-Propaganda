Based on the definitions provided and analysis of the text, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling – Yes** – "imaginary Catholic Pharisees," "neo-Pharisaical escape hatches," "outrageous opinion," "moral and canonical nonsense," "wayward Roman Pontiff."  
2. **Repetition – Yes** – The phrase "Do they think we are fools?" appears twice (and variations like "Apparently, they think we are fools" open/close the text).  
3. **Slogans – No** – No brief, memorable phrases are used as rallying cries (e.g., "Authentic Magisterium®" is mocked, not adopted as a slogan).  
4. **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Warnings of "moral subversion," "unparalleled debacle for the Church," and threats to eternal salvation (e.g., "having to do with the eternal salvation of the soul").  
5. **Doubt – Yes** – Repeatedly questions the credibility of Pope Francis and allies (e.g., "Do they think we are fools?" and "The Cardinal knows this is moral and canonical nonsense").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggerates Francis's actions as a "five-year-long tirade" and minimizes *Amoris Laetitia* as "the only document of its kind in the entire history of the Church."  
7. **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Appeals to Catholic identity/tradition (e.g., "alien to the entire Tradition of the Catholic and Apostolic faith," "defends the Faith").  
8. **Loaded Language – Yes** – Emotionally charged terms like "conspiracy," "moral subversion," "lie from the pit of hell," and "ferocious attack."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon – No** – Does not appeal to popularity; instead, frames opponents as a minority imposing views.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Attributes complex Church disputes solely to a deliberate "program of moral subversion" by Francis and collaborators.  
12. **Obfuscation – No** – The text is direct and inflammatory, not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Cites Cardinal Burke and Father Brian Harrison to validate arguments (e.g., "Cardinal Burke, whom Francis sacked... has observed the obvious").  
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents issues as absolute: either uphold traditional doctrine or enable "moral subversion" (e.g., no middle ground on communion for adulterers).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Uses phrases like "God will not be mocked" and "keep the Faith" to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring – No** – Focus remains on criticisms of Church leadership; no irrelevant distractions introduced.  
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Misrepresents opponents' positions, e.g., reducing "discernment" to allowing adultery during Communion: "people embroiled in adultery can receive Holy Communion while they ‘discern’ that they should not be receiving Holy Communion."  
18. **Whataboutism – No** – Does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy; focuses on their actions alone.  

---

**Verdict – 95%** – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 12 of the 18 techniques, with heavy reliance on **name-calling**, **loaded language**, **appeal to fear**, and **doubt** to delegitimize Pope Francis and his allies. The core purpose is not to engage in theological debate but to emotionally manipulate readers into rejecting Church reforms through repeated accusations of deceit ("Do they think we are fools?"), apocalyptic warnings ("unparalleled debacle"), and appeals to tradition. The one-sided framing, lack of nuance (e.g., **black-and-white fallacy**), and use of **thought-terminating clichés** ("God will not be mocked") further suppress critical analysis. While it references real Church controversies, its tone, rhetorical tactics, and overt agenda (e.g., calling Francis "wayward") align squarely with propaganda aimed at mobilizing opposition. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges its basis in actual events, but its execution is fundamentally persuasive and manipulative.
