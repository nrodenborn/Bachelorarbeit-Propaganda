**Verdict – 95% –**  
The text employs numerous propaganda techniques, including name calling, exaggeration, loaded language, reduction ad Hitlerum, thought-terminating clichés, red herring, and straw man arguments. These techniques are used to ridicule, dehumanize, and discredit the opposing side (leftists/communists), while also distracting from the actual event with irrelevant commentary. The prevalence and intensity of these techniques strongly indicate that the text is propaganda, with a very high likelihood (95%) that its primary purpose is to manipulate the audience’s perception rather than inform objectively.
