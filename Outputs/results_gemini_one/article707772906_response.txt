***

Verdict – 100% – This text is a clear and overt piece of propaganda. It employs a vast majority (15 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques to advance a specific political agenda. Rather than presenting a balanced, factual report, the article uses emotionally charged and loaded language (“cesspool of filth,” “sexual crimes”), logical fallacies like Whataboutism and Red Herring to shift focus onto political opponents, and slogans (“drain the swamp”) to rally support. The piece culminates in an explicit call to action, asking readers to “support my campaign and the campaigns of other anti-establishment candidates,” which removes all doubt about its persuasive and political purpose. The combination of its biased framing, heavy use of manipulative techniques, and direct political solicitation makes it a textbook example of propaganda.
