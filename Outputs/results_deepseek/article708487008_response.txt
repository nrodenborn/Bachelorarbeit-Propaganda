Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against the plague, Madagascar, experts, or any group.
2.  **Repetition** – No – While statistics (2119 cases, 171 deaths) are stated twice, the core message ("plague is impossible to eradicate") is not significantly repeated beyond the headline and Cheng's quotes.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to encapsulate the message beyond the factual headline "Black Death Warning: The Plague Is Impossible To Eradicate".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text emphasizes the deadliness ("can kill a person in just three hours"), the impossibility of eradication, the widespread nature in wildlife, the "unusual" scope affecting populated areas, the WHO urging countries to prepare, and the historical context of the "Black Death". Example: "Since the airborne version of the plague can kill a person in just three hours... it won’t pop up again."
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of specific sources, organizations, or ideas. It presents expert opinion and WHO data as credible.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The claims about lethality (3 hours), impossibility of eradication (stated as expert opinion), case numbers, and WHO actions appear factual or attributed to experts without clear evidence of distortion.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like "Black Death", "impossible", "kill... in just three hours", "too soon", "pop up again", "widespread", "firefighting teams", "attack", and "unusual" carry strong emotional connotations, particularly fear and urgency. Example: "Black Death Warning: The Plague Is Impossible To Eradicate".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No idea is disapproved by associating it with a hated group.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Popularity of the idea that the plague is a threat is not used as an argument. Reliance is on expert opinion and data.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The complexity of plague persistence (wildlife reservoirs, transmission pathways) is acknowledged. Cheng explicitly states eradication is impossible *because* it's widespread in wildlife outside human control and calls for a better understanding of transmission pathways.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is relatively clear. Statistics are given, expert sources are named and quoted directly, and explanations (while concerning a complex topic) are straightforward.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The argument that plague is impossible to eradicate and needs specific management strategies relies heavily on the expertise of Dr. Allen Cheng and the WHO. Example: "Dr. Allen Cheng, Professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology... said", "Cheng wrote", "WHO has reported", "Nine countries were urged by the World Health Organisation (WHO)".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text doesn't present only two extreme choices. It discusses reactive management ("firefighting") and suggests a *better* preventative approach, implying a spectrum of options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No simplistic phrases are used to shut down critical thought. Expert explanations are provided.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the plague outbreak in Madagascar, its characteristics, management, and persistence. No irrelevant material is introduced.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not refute an argument that wasn't actually presented.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are made against any opponent or alternative viewpoint.

**Verdict – 25% –** While the text employs **Appeal to fear** and **Loaded Language** (especially in the headline and descriptions of lethality/scope) and relies on **Appeal to authority**, these techniques are used within the context of reporting factual information from credible sources (WHO, a university professor). The core message about the impossibility of eradication and the need for specific management strategies is presented as expert opinion backed by data and biological reality (wildlife reservoirs). The repetition of statistics is common journalistic practice. The primary goal appears to be informative and alarming (due to the nature of the disease) rather than deliberately manipulative to promote a specific agenda beyond public health awareness. However, the sensationalistic headline and emotionally charged language push it slightly towards propagandistic framing, hence the low percentage likelihood.
