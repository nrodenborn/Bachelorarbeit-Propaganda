1. Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack a subject. Phrases like "dancing with corpses" are used to describe a ritual in a sensational way, but not as a direct name-calling attack on a person or group.
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the ritual of dancing with the dead is the cause of the plague's spread is repeated throughout the text. Example: “The plague that’s airborne and has killed at least 124 people in Madagascar is now blamed on “dancing with corpses.”” and “...exhume the remains of dead relatives, wrap them in a sheet, and dance with them through the streets in a sacred ritual...”
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text is built around creating fear of an "airborne" plague. Example: "The Plague Is AIRBORNE And It’s Spreading..." and "Since it’s airborne, anyone coming close to the corpse of a person who has died of the black death could themselves, catch the infection."
5. Doubt – Yes – The article reports on locals who are casting doubt on the government's credibility. Example: "Josephine Ralisiarisoa firmly believes the country’s cash-strapped government is just exaggerating the problem to get money ahead of an election next year."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline exaggerates a single cultural practice as the main reason for the spread of the plague. The text also includes a quote that minimizes the risk. Example: "The Plague Is AIRBORNE And It’s Spreading Because People Are Literally ‘Dancing With Corpses’" (Exaggeration) and "I have participated in at least 15 famadihana ceremonies in my life. And I’ve never caught the plague,” (Minimization).
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and sensational language to provoke a reaction from the audience. Example: "The Plague Is AIRBORNE And It’s Spreading Because People Are Literally ‘Dancing With Corpses’"
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to hated groups like the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular and should therefore be accepted.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text, particularly the headline, presents a complex epidemiological event as having a single, simple cause. Example: "The Plague Is AIRBORNE And It’s Spreading Because People Are Literally ‘Dancing With Corpses’"
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its messaging, not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from health officials to support its claims. Example: "“If a person dies of pneumonic plague and is then interred in a tomb that is subsequently opened for [the ritual], the bacteria can still be transmitted and contaminate whoever handles the body,” said Willy Randriamarotia, Madagascar’s health ministry chief of staff."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The article frames the situation as a choice between two extremes: either you believe the health officials and stop the ritual, or you believe it's a lie and continue a dangerous practice. Example: The juxtaposition of the health official's warning with the quote, "I will always practice the turning of the bones of my ancestors — plague or no plague. The plague is a lie."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text quotes a local using a phrase that discourages critical thought and ends the conversation. Example: "The plague is a lie."
16. Red herring – No – The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the audience.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not refute an argument that was not presented by the opposing side.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge any party with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 85% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it reports on a real-world event, it employs a significant number of propaganda techniques to frame the narrative in a sensational, emotionally manipulative, and overly simplified manner. The headline itself is a powerful combination of Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language, and Causal Oversimplification, designed to shock the reader rather than inform them. The article consistently uses Repetition to drill in the link between the plague and the ritual. It creates a stark Black & White Fallacy, pitting the rational "health officials" (an Appeal to Authority) against locals whose beliefs are framed as ignorant and dangerous, even quoting a Thought-Terminating Cliché ("The plague is a lie") to reinforce this. The primary goal is not objective journalism but to generate an emotional response (fear, disgust, morbid curiosity) by simplifying a complex public health crisis into a shocking cultural spectacle. This deliberate manipulation of emotion and information for effect is the essence of propaganda.
