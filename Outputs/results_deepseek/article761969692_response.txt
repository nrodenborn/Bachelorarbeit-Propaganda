### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Example: "illegal alien" (used to dehumanize and label undocumented immigrants negatively).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Example: Repeated phrases like "ADVANTAGE IMMIGRANTS" and "immigrant displacement" to reinforce the message.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – Example: "America First" (a memorable phrase promoting nationalism).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Example: Warnings that immigrants will make "native born" a "minuscule fraction of the U.S. population" if trends continue, instilling fear of demographic replacement.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Example: Questioning Trump’s effectiveness: "Trump has not even begun to repair the damage done by eight years of Obama."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Example: Exaggeration: "nearly 2 million foreign-born individuals may have actually settled in the country" (extrapolating net figures dramatically). Minimization: Downplaying native-born job gains as "only 1.9%."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Example: "Americans First" and framing solutions as patriotic duties (e.g., "border wall").  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Example: "displacement," "invasion" (via "Operation Wetback" reference), and "damage" to evoke anger/resentment.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No direct comparison to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Popularity of ideas is not cited as evidence.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Example: Blaming immigration alone for native-born job struggles, ignoring other economic factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Data is presented concretely (though selectively).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Example: Citing BLS data to lend credibility, despite biased interpretation.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Example: Presenting immigration moratorium/wall as the "only answer" to complex economic issues.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Example: "cannot be jawboned away" shuts down debate on non-legislative solutions.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Example: Blaming Obama for current trends to distract from Trump’s record.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy against critics.

### Verdict – 85% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Use of Techniques**: It employs multiple loaded techniques (e.g., fear-mongering, name-calling, oversimplification) to frame immigrants as threats while promoting nativist policies.  
2. **Selective Data Presentation**: Statistics are cherry-picked (e.g., highlighting "ADVANTAGE IMMIGRANTS" metrics while downplaying native gains) to create a skewed narrative of displacement.  
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Language like "shocking surge," "illegal alien," and demographic doom scenarios ("miniscule fraction") stokes anxiety and xenophobia.  
4. **Political Agenda**: Explicit calls for extreme legislation (e.g., "moratorium," "second Operation Wetback") align with ideological goals, not neutral analysis.  
5. **Source Bias**: VDARE (cited in "NVDAWDI") is a known anti-immigration platform, further indicating propagandistic intent.  

While it uses factual data (BLS reports), the framing, omissions (e.g., economic benefits of immigration), and inflammatory rhetoric reveal a clear objective: to sway opinion against immigration through fear and division. The 15% uncertainty reflects the veneer of data citation, but the overall execution meets propaganda criteria.
