Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* The author labels Faggioli's approach as "a combination of rhetorical tricks and soft-peddled Hegelianism" and calls his historicism "rank historicism," both insulting labels.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – *Explanation:* No specific phrase or core message is repeated incessantly throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – *Explanation:* No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans to encapsulate the author's main point.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* The author invokes Pope Benedict XVI's warning about a "dictatorship of relativism" and the specter of placing "himself above God" to instill fear about the consequences of Faggioli's proposed approach.
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – *Explanation:* While disagreeing, the author doesn't primarily frame arguments by questioning Faggioli's basic credibility as a theologian or source.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – *Explanation:* While strongly opinionated, the author doesn't overtly exaggerate Faggioli's position beyond calling it "absurd" or minimize opposing viewpoints in a way that fits this definition.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* The author appeals to Catholic identity and loyalty to tradition, invoking figures like Pope Benedict XVI and the long-standing "institutions that have upheld this truth for centuries" to argue against change.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* Words and phrases like "rhetorical tricks," "soft-peddled Hegelianism," "theologically unsettling," "absurd," "whims and failures," "rank historicism," "dangerous historicist impulse," and "dictatorship of relativism" are emotionally charged and carry strong negative connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – *Explanation:* The author does not compare Faggioli's ideas or the proposed changes to Nazism, Hitler, or other universally reviled groups/systems.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – *Explanation:* The author doesn't argue that Faggioli's view should be rejected simply because it's unpopular or that the traditional view should be accepted because it's popular. The appeal is to truth and tradition, not popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – *Explanation:* The author doesn't attribute complex problems (like secularism or loss of faith) to a single, simple cause within the text.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – *Explanation:* The author is actually quite direct and clear in stating their disagreement and critique, using strong, specific language rather than vague or confusing terms to obscure meaning.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* The author heavily relies on the authority of Pope Benedict XVI, quoting him at length to support the argument against Faggioli's position.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* The author frames the debate as an absolute choice between upholding unchanging truth ("institutions that have upheld this truth for centuries") or succumbing to a dangerous "dictatorship of relativism," presenting only these two extreme options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – *Explanation:* While using strong phrases like "dictatorship of relativism," these are argued and elaborated upon rather than used as simplistic, conversation-ending clichés.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* The introduction of the example about judging Donald Trump's presidency is irrelevant to the theological debate about communion and serves to distract by appealing to political sentiment. ("Could we possibly say, for instance, that it’s impossible to judge the presidency of Donald Trump relative to past presidents?")
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* The author misrepresents Faggioli's position, implying Faggioli wants the Church to simply "bend to the will of secular society" and "accommodate the whims and failures of secular modernity." Faggioli's actual argument, as presented, was about evangelization and enabling sacramental participation within a specific context, not wholesale capitulation.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – *Explanation:* The author does not charge Faggioli with hypocrisy by pointing out inconsistent actions or beliefs in Faggioli's past or other areas.

**Verdict – 75% – Detailed Explanation:**

The text exhibits clear characteristics of propaganda, primarily through its strong persuasive intent and use of specific techniques, though it falls short of being pure, state-level disinformation. It is an opinion piece heavily advocating for a traditionalist Catholic viewpoint against perceived progressive interpretations. Key indicators include:

1.  **Persuasive Intent & Bias:** The author has a clear agenda: to discredit Massimo Faggioli's arguments and defend a traditional, unchanging view of Catholic doctrine and papal authority. The language is consistently polemical and dismissive of the opposing view.
2.  **Use of Propaganda Techniques:** The text employs several identifiable techniques effectively:
    *   **Name Calling/Loaded Language:** "Rhetorical tricks," "soft-peddled Hegelianism," "rank historicism," "absurd," "whims and failures," "dangerous historicist impulse," "dictatorship of relativism" – all serve to demonize Faggioli's position.
    *   **Appeal to Fear:** Invoking the "dictatorship of relativism" and the idea of man placing himself above God creates a fear of the consequences of adopting Faggioli's views.
    *   **Appeal to Authority:** Heavy reliance on Pope Benedict XVI's quotes lends weight to the author's argument against change.
    *   **Black & White Fallacy:** Framing the issue as a binary choice between eternal truth/dogma and dangerous relativism eliminates nuance.
    *   **Straw Man:** Misrepresenting Faggioli's argument about Germany and sacramental accessibility as simply "bending to secular society" makes it easier to attack.
    *   **Red Herring:** Introducing the Donald Trump presidency comparison is irrelevant to the theological discussion and serves only to trigger political bias.
    *   **Flag-Waving:** Appealing to Catholic identity, loyalty to tradition, and the authority of long-standing institutions reinforces in-group loyalty against perceived threats.
3.  **Emotional Appeal Over Rational Discourse:** While some arguments are presented (e.g., quoting Benedict), the overall tone relies heavily on emotional language, ridicule ("absurd"), and fear-mongering rather than a purely rational, dispassionate analysis of the theological debate.
4.  **Omission of Nuance:** The author dismisses Faggioli's core argument about historical development and context ("historicism") without engaging deeply with its theological merits, focusing instead on its perceived dangers. The complexity of the debate over communion for the remarried is reduced.

**Why not 100%?**
*   The text reports on an actual debate and summarizes the positions of Douthat and Faggioli to some extent, providing context.
*   It acknowledges some points (e.g., finding Faggioli's suggestion "lovely" and "not entirely unsympathetic," noting the debate is largely among intellectuals).
*   It engages, however biasedly, with specific theological concepts and quotes.

**Conclusion:** While grounded in a real event and containing elements of reporting, the text's primary function is persuasive advocacy for a specific, traditionalist viewpoint within Catholicism. It achieves this through a concerted use of emotionally charged language, misrepresentation of the opposing view, appeals to fear and authority, and the framing of the issue in stark, absolute terms – hallmarks of propaganda. The likelihood of it being classified as propaganda is therefore high (75%).
