Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack its opponents, such as "drive-by media," "self-proclaimed 'fact checkers'," and calling them liars with "Communist teeth."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the accusation of "lying" against various individuals and outlets (e.g., "Steven Colbert, you're lying. Jimmy Kimmel, you're lying. CNN, you're lying."). The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is also repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – While the text has a clear and repeated message, it does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses more on generating anger and distrust towards the media rather than instilling fear of a specific negative outcome.

Doubt – Yes – The text is built around casting doubt on the credibility of the media and fact-checkers. For example, it asks the rhetorical question, "If they're prepared to lie this shamelessly, what else are they lying about?"

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the alteration of the video by calling it "enhanced, not doctored," while exaggerating the media's actions by accusing them of lying through their "Communist teeth" and engaging in a "blatant conspiracy."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make significant appeals to patriotism or national identity to support its claims.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to create a negative emotional response, such as "drive-by media," "lying through their Communist teeth," and "Clown News Network."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text uses a variation of this by associating the media with a hated group, stating they are "lying through their Communist teeth."

Bandwagon – Yes – The text creates an "us vs. them" mentality and implies a shared viewpoint with the reader ("Yep, I noticed too..."). It also presents a poll, a tool often used to suggest and build popular opinion.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex issue of media bias and the specific incident with Jim Acosta down to a single cause: that the media are intentionally lying as part of a conspiracy. For example: "PJW has exposed their blatant conspiracy to smear President Trump, Sarah Sanders and the White House aide."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; it is direct and aggressive in its accusations, clearly naming the individuals and organizations it targets.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites authorities that its target audience would likely trust, such as when it states, "Watson then went on to be happy that President Trump backed him up on his comments about the video." It also presents C-SPAN as a neutral, authoritative source.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the issue as a simple choice between two extremes: either the media and fact-checkers are telling the truth, or Infowars and the author are. The poll provided also presents a loaded black-and-white choice: "Yes, he should have gotten it back" or "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses dismissive, cliché-like phrases to shut down discussion, such as "Yeah, right!" and "I'm sorry Jim, I can't hear you over the booming voice of your hypocrisy!"

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the author's personal legal dispute with MediaBiasFactCheck.com ("I had to have my attorneys send a letter for their libel..."). This is irrelevant to the central claim about the Jim Acosta video and serves to distract the reader while attempting to discredit a fact-checking site.

Straw men – Yes – The text redefines the media's claim that the video was "doctored" into a narrow definition that is easier to argue against, stating "that's not doctoring. Doctoring is when you manipulate the content to misconstrue the reality..." This misrepresents the broader criticism that the video's alterations were misleading, regardless of the specific term used.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text directly accuses its opponents of hypocrisy. For example, it ends with the line: "I'm sorry Jim, I can't hear you over the booming voice of your hypocrisy!"

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. It employs a vast majority (15 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques, often multiple times. The article's purpose is not to inform or engage in reasoned debate, but to manipulate the reader's emotions and reinforce a specific worldview. It achieves this by using aggressive and emotionally loaded language (Name Calling, Loaded Language), creating an "us vs. them" narrative (Bandwagon, Black & White Fallacy), and attacking the credibility of all opposing sources through doubt, accusations of hypocrisy, and logical fallacies (Doubt, Whataboutism, Straw Man). The inclusion of a personal anecdote about a legal threat (Red Herring) and the repeated accusations of a "conspiracy" serve to solidify a narrative of persecution and righteousness, which is a hallmark of propagandistic writing. The sheer density of these techniques indicates a deliberate effort to bypass critical thought in favor of an emotional, tribalistic response.
