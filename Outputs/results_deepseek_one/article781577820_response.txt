Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

**Technique Analysis:**
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "favorite piñatas" (used to describe Sessions' relationship with Trump, implying Trump attacks him for sport).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No significant repetition of phrases for emphasis.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable rallying phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL" is absent).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No language instilling fear about alternatives.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Trump questions Sessions' credibility: "What kind of man is this?" and "never took control of the Justice Department."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Sessions claims "unprecedented success" (exaggeration of his accomplishments).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Sessions references protecting "safety and security... of the American people" and "advances religious liberty" (appeals to national identity/values).  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "favorite piñatas" (negative, violent imagery), "turbulent 19-month-old presidency" (emotionally charged).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity or peer pressure.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified cause-effect claims.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Statements are direct and clear (e.g., Sessions' denial is explicit).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Sessions cites his own actions, not external authorities.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomies presented.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases halting critical thought (e.g., "I demand the highest standards" invites scrutiny).  
16. **Red herring** – No – Sessions focuses directly on rebutting Trump's claims.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Sessions refutes Trump’s actual criticism ("never took control").  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no deflection like "What about Trump's past?").  

**Verdict – 30% –**  
The text is primarily a news report documenting a political dispute, not propaganda. It neutrally presents both Trump’s criticisms and Sessions’ rebuttal, attributing statements clearly. However, minor propagandistic elements exist:  
- **Propaganda aspects (30%)**: Loaded language ("piñatas," "turbulent") and techniques used *within the quoted statements* (e.g., Sessions’ flag-waving/self-aggrandizement; Trump’s name-calling/doubt). These reflect the subjects’ rhetoric, not the article’s intent.  
- **Non-propaganda aspects (70%)**: The article avoids manipulation by providing context (e.g., Hunter indictment timeline), quoting both sides, and ending with factual sourcing. No overt persuasion or omission of key perspectives is detected.  
**Conclusion**: The text reports on propagandistic statements by political figures but does not inherently function as propaganda itself. Its journalistic framing reduces bias, though selected quotes carry inherent rhetorical techniques.
