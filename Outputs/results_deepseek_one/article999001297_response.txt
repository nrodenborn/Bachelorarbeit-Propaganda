### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text **heavily employs propaganda techniques** to frame migrants as a threat and manipulate reader perception. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded language ("illegally entering," "disgrace") and fear appeals portray migrants as dangerous.  
- **Distraction & polarization**: The irrelevant Acosta poll (red herring) and binary voting (black/white fallacy) divert attention and suppress nuanced discussion.  
- **Authority & nationalism**: Quotes from officials (appeal to authority) and phrases like "Border security is national security" (flag-waving) legitimize a strict border narrative.  
- **Repetition & sloganeering**: Repeated phrases ("Arrest and deport them all") reinforce a dehumanizing message.  
- **Selective framing**: Emphasizing migrants "effortlessly" climbing fences while omitting context (e.g., most presented at ports of entry) exaggerates insecurity.  

While the text includes factual elements (e.g., CBP tweets, Nielsen’s location), its construction prioritizes eliciting outrage over balanced reporting. The disproportionate use of techniques (13/18 detected) suggests a clear intent to sway opinion against the caravan, aligning with propaganda objectives. The 10% uncertainty stems from the inclusion of neutral agency statements, though these are overshadowed by inflammatory framing.
