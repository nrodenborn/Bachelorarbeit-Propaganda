Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "despicable tactic," "lowest level of character assassination," "cesspool of public gossip," "contemptible, obstructionist tactics," "shameless smear campaign."  
2. **Repetition** – No – No single phrase is repeated persistently.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable rallying phrases (e.g., no equivalents to "BUILD THE WALL").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No attempt to instill fear about alternatives; focuses on discrediting opponents.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Repeatedly questions Ford’s credibility: "murky and begins to fall apart," "partial memory," "gaping hole in the therapist’s notes," "lack of any credible corroborating evidence."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimizes Ford’s allegation ("unsubstantiated allegation of teen sexual misbehavior") while exaggerating Democratic tactics ("lowest level of character assassination").  
7. **Flag-waving** – No – No overt appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms like "character assassination," "despicable," "cesspool," "shameless smear campaign," and "debased themselves."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Uses the letter from 65 women to imply consensus: "65 women who knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school vouched for his character."  
11. **Causal oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified cause-effect claims (e.g., doesn’t blame one actor for the entire controversy).  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Arguments are direct, not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites the FBI’s inaction ("FBI decided not to pursue investigation") and the women’s letter as authoritative support for Kavanaugh’s innocence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents Kavanaugh as purely innocent ("lifetime record of stellar public service") and Democrats as purely malicious ("ideological reasons," "obstructionist tactics"), ignoring middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "case closed" to shut down debate; invites scrutiny.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Diverts to Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy: "Feminists gave serial sexual predator Bill Clinton a free pass," "Senator Feinstein called Ted ‘Chappaquiddick’ Kennedy an ‘inspiration.’"  
17. **Straw men** – No – Accurately represents opponents’ actions (e.g., Feinstein’s handling of the letter).  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Accuses Democrats of hypocrisy by referencing Clinton/Kennedy: "Hypocritically exploiting... Democrats seeking to torpedo Judge Kavanaugh... have debased themselves."  

---

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 8 confirmed propaganda techniques (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, doubt, whataboutism) to vilify Democrats, discredit Christine Blasey Ford, and absolve Kavanaugh. The language is emotionally manipulative ("character assassination," "shameless smear campaign"), and it selectively omits counter-evidence (e.g., no engagement with Ford’s specific claims beyond attacking her credibility). While it includes factual elements (e.g., timelines, FBI actions), these are framed to support a one-sided narrative. The red herring comparing Ford’s allegation to Clinton/Kennedy scandals and the black-and-white portrayal of Kavanaugh as flawless further confirm its intent to persuade through bias, not balanced analysis. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges minor factual reporting (e.g., Feinstein’s letter handling), but the dominant tone is ideological persuasion.
