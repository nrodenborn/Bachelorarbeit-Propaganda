Here is the analysis of the text against the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "former top spook" (referring to Mike Pompeo). "Clinton City…" (referring to Mike Pompeo's views).
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – No specific phrase or message is repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – The text does not employ brief, memorable, rallying phrases like slogans.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "She’s a big fan of torture...", "...centrally involved in the worst abuses...", "...particularly gruesome torture...", "...vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes...". These descriptions are used to instill fear about Gina Haspel's appointment and the continuation of past policies.
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – The text does not directly question the credibility of a specific person or entity in a way defined as the technique. It asserts negative views strongly.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "She’s a big fan of torture" is likely an exaggeration (or highly loaded interpretation) of her reported role in the program. The phrase "world-on-fire, Russians everywhere State Department shenanigans" is a clear exaggeration/minimization of the Obama-era State Department.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – The text does not appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or a specific group identity to bolster its argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Numerous examples: "strained relationship", "big shake-up", "deep state", "shenanigans", "non-state hostile intelligence service", "torture regime", "controversial interrogation program", "harsh techniques", "gruesome torture", "destruction of interrogation videotapes", "obstruction". These words carry strong negative connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or universally hated groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text does not argue that an idea should be accepted because it's popular.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The text doesn't attribute complex events to single, simple causes.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and uses specific (though often loaded) language. It doesn't rely on deliberately vague or confusing expressions.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites the Washington Post article ("a 2013 Washington Post article pointed out..."), Greg Miller (WaPo reporter), the Senate Intelligence Committee report, and the condemnation by 9/11 commission chairs Hamilton and Keane to support its claims about Haspel.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – The text doesn't present a complex situation as having only two possible choices or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – The text doesn't use simplistic phrases to shut down discussion; it provides arguments (albeit biased ones).
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on criticizing Pompeo and Haspel's records and linking them to past Democratic administrations. It doesn't introduce major irrelevant topics.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text criticizes specific, reported views and actions of Pompeo and Haspel (e.g., Pompeo on Russia, WikiLeaks, Iran/NK; Haspel on torture, tape destruction). It doesn't misrepresent an opposing argument to easily refute it.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text *compares* Pompeo/Haspel to Clinton/Obama policies to criticize them, but it doesn't use this comparison primarily to deflect criticism or charge hypocrisy. The criticism of Pompeo/Haspel is the main point, using the comparison as evidence of undesirable continuity.

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits several clear propaganda techniques, most notably **Loaded Language** (pervasive negative, emotionally charged descriptions), **Appeal to Fear** (graphic depictions of torture and destruction of evidence), **Appeal to Authority** (citing sources to validate its negative claims), and **Exaggeration/Minimization** ("big fan of torture", "world-on-fire... shenanigans"). The core message is highly critical and persuasive, framing the appointments of Pompeo and Haspel as a dangerous continuation of Obama/Clinton-era policies, particularly regarding Russia and interrogation techniques. While it cites sources like the Washington Post and Senate reports for factual grounding, the selection of facts, the extreme language ("torture regime", "gruesome torture", "shenanigans"), and the deliberate comparisons ("If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure...", "if you liked Obama-era... this is your guy", "Bottom line, George W. Bush/Barack Obama era foreign policy... aren’t going anywhere") demonstrate a strong intent to persuade the reader towards a specific, negative viewpoint rather than provide a neutral report. The use of "top spook" and "Clinton City" as **Name Calling** further reinforces the biased perspective. It is not purely factual reporting; it is argumentative journalism leaning heavily into propaganda techniques to shape the reader's perception.
