### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 80% –**  
**Explanation:**  
The text displays several propaganda techniques, including repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, obfuscation, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and thought-terminating clichés. These techniques are used to shape the reader’s perception of the incident, cast doubt on Jim Acosta’s credibility, and frame the White House’s actions in a particular light. The repetition of the poll question, emotionally charged language, and oversimplification of the issue are strong indicators of propaganda. However, the text also includes factual reporting and statements from both sides, which somewhat reduces the overall propagandistic nature. Given the presence of multiple techniques and the clear attempt to influence opinion, there is a high likelihood (80%) that the text functions as propaganda.
