Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "criminal mayors" (referring to the US Conference of Mayors).
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – While terms like "#NeverAgain" and "Take the guns first and then due process" are mentioned, they are attributed to others and not used as the author's own slogan. The text lacks a distinct, repeated brief phrase used by the author as a slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "attacking the rights of the people", "infringe on the rights", "sides with criminals against law-abiding citizens", "violating the Fifth Amendment rights", "threatens the public safety", "fear of being gunned down". These phrases instill fear about the consequences of the proposed legislation.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "None of these statements can be backed up by facts. The facts refute their arguments..." directly questions the credibility of the mayors' statements and claims.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "gun confiscation legislation" (exaggerates the described policies which focus on regulation/sales bans, not general confiscation), "It doesn't" (minimizes any potential effect of the proposed policies on gun violence).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – While the Second Amendment is invoked, it's framed as a right being infringed upon, not used as a patriotic appeal to rally support *for* the author's cause beyond defending the right itself. Appeals are more to rights/freedom than patriotism.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Pervasive use: "hypocrisy", "infringe", "attacking", "unconstitutional", "unlawful", "criminal mayors", "violating", "mantra", "rips families... apart", "common-sense, life-saving laws" (used mockingly via quote), "NRA priorities" (used negatively via quote).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt to link the mayors' policies to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The author argues *against* the popular position being advocated by the mayors and gun control groups, positioning themselves as the opposition.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – "Because they won't follow your unconstitutional and unlawful laws in the first place!" simplifies the complex causes of gun violence and criminal behavior to solely non-compliance with laws.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The author states their opposition and critiques quite directly, even listing specific policies they disagree with.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – The author does not invoke any authority to support their own position. They dismiss the mayors' authority.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – "sides with criminals against law-abiding citizens" presents the mayors' opposition to "Stand Your Ground" laws as siding *only* with criminals and *against* law-abiding citizens, ignoring potential nuances or other perspectives.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "It’s as simple as that,” (used via quote, but presented uncritically as part of the opposition's faulty reasoning), "It doesn't" (dismissing any effect of policies), "nothing could be further from the truth".
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introducing the poll about "the most corrupt Democrat Politician" is completely irrelevant to the discussion of gun control policies and the US Conference of Mayors' resolutions.
17. **Straw men** – Yes – "How any of this is consistent with support for the Second Amendment is anyone's guess. I think they throw that language in to cover for the fact that they are attacking it head on" misrepresents the mayors' stated position of believing their policies *are* consistent with the 2nd Amendment, portraying it instead as a deliberate deception to cover an outright attack.
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – "If you buy into this, you probably think places like Chicago, Illinois are among the safest places to live in the US when the opposite is true." This deflects from the discussion of the mayors' resolutions by charging them (and their supporters) with hypocrisy regarding Chicago's gun violence despite strict laws.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a very high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is not to neutrally inform but to aggressively persuade the reader to reject the US Conference of Mayors' gun control proposals and view the organization and its supporters negatively. This is achieved through repeated use of loaded language, name-calling, appeals to fear, doubt, straw man arguments, black-and-white fallacies, causal oversimplification, and whataboutism. The inclusion of an irrelevant poll (red herring) further signals an intent beyond objective reporting. While it references real resolutions and quotes, these are presented solely within a framework designed to discredit them and evoke an emotional, negative response aligned with a specific political viewpoint opposing gun control. The consistent framing, dismissive tone, and reliance on multiple persuasive (rather than purely informative) techniques overwhelmingly classify this text as propaganda.
