1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels migrants as "CRIMINALS" and describes the situation as a "Democrat Party led... assault on our country."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Will the Democrats try to impeach President Trump now that they control the House?" is repeated three times consecutively. The word "onslaught" is also used multiple times to describe the caravan.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text quotes the phrase, "All Democrats fault for weak laws!" which is a brief and memorable phrase designed to assign blame.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear by describing the caravan as an "assault on our country" and warning of "Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in."
5. Doubt – Yes – The author questions the credibility of Trump's threats by stating, "If they make it here and Trump does nothing... then you know the words are empty and hollow."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author makes the unsubstantiated and extreme claim that "every single migrant who crosses over into our country will more than likely commit at least 28 crimes in order to present themselves as legal."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the caravan as an "assault on our country" and a threat to the "Southern Border," urging a strong national defense.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "onslaught" and "assault" to describe the migrant caravan, aiming to evoke strong negative emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or other similar groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The statement "All Democrats fault for weak laws!" attributes the complex issue of migration to a single, simple cause.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The claim that migrants will "commit at least 28 crimes in order to present themselves as legal" is presented without any evidence or explanation, making it a vague assertion designed to sound specific and alarming.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article heavily relies on quoting President Donald Trump's tweets as the primary source of information and justification for its stance.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The author presents a false dichotomy by suggesting Trump's only valid option is to "simply turn them away," and any other action means his "words are empty and hollow," ignoring a spectrum of other policy responses.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "All Democrats fault for weak laws!" is a simplistic statement that discourages any deeper analysis of the complex issue of immigration legislation.
16. Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of a poll about whether Democrats will impeach Trump is irrelevant to the main topic of the migrant caravan and serves to distract the reader with a different political issue.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument not being made by claiming Democrats "want Open Borders," a misrepresentation of their actual policy positions, making their stance easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy; instead, it maintains a direct attack on its targets.

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly emotional viewpoint. This is evidenced by the overwhelming use of 16 out of the 18 listed propaganda techniques. The article blends reporting on President Trump's tweets with its own inflammatory commentary, creating a narrative of crisis and invasion. It employs fear-mongering (warning of "CRIMINALS" and "DRUGS"), loaded language ("assault," "onslaught"), causal oversimplification ("All Democrats fault"), and a blatant red herring (the impeachment poll) to manipulate the reader's emotions and shut down critical thought. The unsubstantiated exaggeration about migrants committing "28 crimes" further demonstrates a disregard for facts in favor of emotional impact. The entire piece is structured to reinforce a particular political ideology rather than provide a balanced account of the event.
