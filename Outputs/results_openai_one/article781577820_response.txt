Verdict – 40% – The text contains some elements of propaganda, such as name-calling, doubt, exaggeration, and flag-waving. These techniques suggest a moderate use of propaganda to influence the reader's perception of Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump. However, the presence of these techniques is not overwhelming, and the text also includes factual reporting and statements from both parties involved. Thus, while there are elements of propaganda, it is not the dominant feature of the text.
