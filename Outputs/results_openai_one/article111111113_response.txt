Certainly! Here is the analysis for each propaganda technique, followed by the final verdict:

---

**1. Name calling – No –** There are no insulting labels directly used against individuals or groups in the text.  
**2. Repetition – No –** There is no significant repetition of a particular phrase or message.  
**3. Slogans – Yes –** "BUILD THE WALL!" is cited as a slogan used by Trump.  
**4. Appeal to fear – Yes –** The text references Trump and others using Steinle’s death as evidence of the "perils of 'Illegal Immigration,'" and ICE Director Homan’s statement that sanctuary policies "endanger the lives of Americans."  
**5. Doubt – Yes –** The text questions the credibility of Trump’s claims, stating he "falsely claimed on Twitter that Garcia Zarate had previously committed violent crimes."  
**6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes –** Trump’s claim that Garcia Zarate "always committing crimes and being violent" is an exaggeration, as the text clarifies his prior convictions were nonviolent.  
**7. Flag-Waving – Yes –** The phrase "endanger the lives of Americans" and the use of "BUILD THE WALL!" appeal to patriotism and national identity.  
**8. Loaded Language – Yes –** Phrases like "firestorm of outrage," "villainized," "crusade against 'sanctuary cities,'" and "travesty of justice" are emotionally charged.

**10. Bandwagon – No –** There is no direct appeal to popularity or suggestion that "everyone" supports a particular view.  
**11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes –** The argument that Steinle "would still be alive were it not for an insecure border and lenient treatment" oversimplifies a complex situation.  
**12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No –** The text is generally clear and provides details from multiple perspectives.  
**13. Appeal to authority – Yes –** ICE Director Thomas Homan’s statement is used to support a particular view.  
**14. Black & white fallacy – Yes –** The framing that the tragedy "could have been prevented if San Francisco had simply turned the alien over to ICE" presents a binary choice, ignoring other factors.  
**15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes –** "BUILD THE WALL!" is a thought-terminating slogan that discourages further discussion.  
**16. Red herring – No –** The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main issue.  
**17. Straw men – No –** The text does not misrepresent an opponent's argument to refute it.  
**18. Whataboutism – Yes –** The text notes that ICE "has faced criticism of its own" for not seeking a judicial warrant, which shifts some blame back onto the agency.

**Final Verdict**

**Verdict – 70% –**  
The text is primarily a news summary that attempts to present multiple perspectives on the Kate Steinle case, including the facts of the shooting, the legal proceedings, and the subsequent political debate. However, it contains numerous examples of propaganda techniques, especially when quoting or describing political actors (e.g., Trump, ICE officials) and their use of slogans, appeals to fear, exaggerations, and black-and-white framing. The text also includes some corrective context and fact-checking, which reduces its overall propagandistic character. Still, the presence of loaded language, slogans, and simplifications—particularly in the quoted material and the way the debate is framed—means that propaganda techniques are present and influential in shaping the reader’s perception. Therefore, there is a significant likelihood (70%) that the text functions as propaganda, especially in the context of the immigration debate, though it also contains elements of balanced reporting.
