### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels used against subjects; terms like "convicted felon" are factual descriptors.  
2. **Repetition** – No – Key facts (officers' deaths, gun purchase) are stated once; no redundant messaging.  
3. **Slogans** – No – Phrases like "true American heroes" are tributes, not crafted slogans for persuasion.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – Reports threats but doesn’t weaponize fear to push an agenda.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility; suspects’ backgrounds are stated factually.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Descriptions are measured (e.g., "injured," "gunned down" fit the context).

12. **Obfuscation** – No – Language is clear and specific (e.g., details of charges, events).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Quotes from police chief, governor, and president used to validate the narrative.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomies; complexity acknowledged (e.g., suspect’s hospitalization).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – Phrases like "true American heroes" honor the deceased but don’t explicitly halt discourse.

### Verdict – 15% –  
The text is primarily **factual news reporting**, not propaganda. It details a crime, arrests, official statements, and community reactions with attribution (e.g., DOJ, police). While emotionally charged language (e.g., "heroes," "ambushed") and patriotic appeals (flag-lowering) appear, these are **quotes from officials** or contextual descriptors, not systematic manipulation. The absence of repeated slogans, fear-mongering, or distorted logic supports its journalistic intent. The 15% reflects minor loaded language/flag-waving within otherwise neutral reporting.
