Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No – No direct insulting labels (e.g., "fascists" or "traitors") are applied to subjects.  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated emphasis on identity-focused themes (e.g., multiple references to "race," "gender," "ethnicity," and contrasts with underrepresented topics like "Liberalism" or "Democracy").  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – The phrase "get with the multiculturalist/Identity Politics program" acts as a memorable, dismissive call-to-action.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Implies traditional historical study is being replaced by identity politics, instilling fear about losing focus on "what really matter[s] to history, and to society."  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Opens by questioning the credibility of history education ("Ever thought that the academic discipline of history has gone to the Diversity dogs?").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates the dominance of identity themes (e.g., calling traditional topics "mere historiographical curiosities") and minimizes their scholarly value.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or national identity; focus is on critiquing academia.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Uses emotionally charged phrases like "gone to the Diversity dogs," "dutifully," and "mere historiographical curiosities" to evoke disdain.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association of ideas with hated groups (e.g., Nazis).  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Does not argue for adopting an idea because it is popular; instead, it criticizes current trends.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes curriculum changes solely to "identity politics," ignoring complex factors like evolving scholarship or societal shifts.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is direct and specific (e.g., citing exact numbers of courses).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites the IPA report and Dr. d’Abrera’s Cambridge credentials to legitimize the audit.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents history education as a binary choice: identity politics vs. traditional "political, intellectual, demographic and material factors."  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – The concluding line ("get with the multiculturalist/Identity Politics program") uses a cliché to dismiss debate and critical analysis.  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions; all content relates to the core argument.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Does not misrepresent an opposing argument; critiques actual course themes.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Does not accuse critics of hypocrisy.  

---

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs multiple persuasive techniques—including **exaggeration**, **loaded language**, **appeal to fear**, **doubt**, and **black & white fallacy**—to advance a biased critique of history education. It selectively presents data (e.g., course counts) to frame identity-focused topics as dominant and academically inferior while dismissing traditional themes as "curiosities." The tone is sardonic and emotionally charged (e.g., "gone to the Diversity dogs"), and it concludes with a thought-terminating cliché urging readers to conform to its viewpoint. Though it cites a report, this authority is used to oversimplify a nuanced issue and delegitimize opposing perspectives. The core intent is not balanced analysis but to provoke alarm about "identity politics" in academia.
