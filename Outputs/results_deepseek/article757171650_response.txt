Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. Name calling – No – No insulting labels are used against any subject.  
2. Repetition – Yes – "Explosive increase" is repeated 3 times (in headlines, quotes, and body text).  
3. Slogans – No – No brief, memorable phrases are coined or emphasized beyond factual descriptions.  
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Warnings of "urban Ebola" and "explosive increase" emphasize catastrophic urban spread to instill fear (e.g., "a city of 10 million people").  
5. Doubt – No – No questioning of credibility; sources (WHO, officials) are presented authoritatively.  
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – Terms like "explosive increase" and "very different animal" are dramatic but contextually accurate for an Ebola outbreak. No minimization.  
7. Flag-Waving – No – No appeals to patriotism or group identity.  
8. Loaded Language – Yes – "Urban Ebola" and "very different animal" evoke heightened urgency; "body bags" carries emotional weight.  
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – No associations with hated groups.  
10. Bandwagon – No – No appeal to popularity.  
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – Complexity is acknowledged (e.g., transportation challenges, vaccination logistics).  
12. Obfuscation – No – Details are specific (e.g., case numbers, locations, temperature requirements).  
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Relies on WHO officials (Salama) and health ministers for credibility (e.g., "Senior WHO official Peter Salama said...").  
14. Black & white fallacy – No – No false dichotomies; multiple factors are discussed.  
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – No phrases used to halt critical discussion.  
16. Red herring – No – All details relate directly to the outbreak.  
17. Straw men – No – No misrepresented arguments are refuted.  
18. Whataboutism – No – No accusations of hypocrisy.  

**Verdict – 15% – Explanation**:  
The text is primarily factual reporting, citing WHO warnings and epidemiological details (case numbers, transmission risks, response measures). While it uses **repetition** ("explosive increase"), **appeal to fear** (urban spread implications), **loaded language** ("urban Ebola"), and **appeal to authority** (relying on WHO quotes), these techniques are not employed manipulatively. They serve to accurately convey the severity of a public health crisis, consistent with responsible journalism. The dramatic phrasing reflects genuine expert concern, not distortion. The absence of misleading techniques (e.g., straw men, false dichotomies) and the inclusion of contextual details (e.g., past outbreaks, logistical challenges) further support its informational intent. However, the headline’s emphasis on fear and the sourcing from *Zero Hedge* (a site known for sensationalism) slightly elevate propaganda likelihood. Overall, it is not propaganda but rather heightened crisis reporting.
