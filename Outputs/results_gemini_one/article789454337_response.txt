1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses the term “blue privilege” as an insulting label to attack the perceived special treatment given to police officers.

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times in the middle of the text.

3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase “blue privilege” is used as a brief, memorable phrase to encapsulate the article's central argument.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states, "The reaction from the police, in this case, has shown that they believe they have a license to kill and that they cannot be trusted to monitor themselves," which is intended to instill fear about the police force.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the integrity of the police investigation by stating, "It would be reasonable to assume that these steps were taken intentionally because they want to see her get away with it."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration with the statement, "Not even the richest people in the country with the best lawyers would receive this type of treatment if they just admitted to killing an innocent person."

7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its point.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The title itself uses loaded language: "Activists Who Peacefully Protested Her Rot in Jail." The word "rot" is emotionally charged to evoke a sense of injustice and disgust.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or similarly hated groups.

10. Bandwagon – No – The article argues a specific viewpoint but does not claim it is correct simply because it is popular.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex events of the case—such as the specific charge and bail conditions—to the single, simple cause of “blue privilege,” ignoring the nuances of the legal process.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article is direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article uses quotes from "Attorney Lee Merritt, who represents Botham Jean’s family" as evidence to support its claims of injustice.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by stating, "Guyger has been treated as more of a victim than a killer," presenting only two extreme roles while ignoring any middle ground or nuance.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase, "It is obvious in this case that Guyger is receiving special treatment," which presents the author's conclusion as a self-evident fact to discourage the reader from questioning it.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text includes a poll, "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?", which is completely irrelevant to the article's topic and serves as a distraction.

17. Straw men – Yes – The article states that police found marijuana and "attempted to use to smear his name and somehow justify the killing." This creates a weak, easily refutable argument (that marijuana justifies murder) to attribute to the police, thereby making their position seem monstrous.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses entirely on the case at hand and does not attempt to deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy on an unrelated matter.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint towards the police and the justice system. It achieves this by employing a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques, including name-calling (“blue privilege”), loaded language (“rot in jail”), appeal to fear (“license to kill”), and causal oversimplification (attributing everything to “blue privilege”). The article presents a one-sided narrative, frames opinion as fact (“It is obvious...”), and uses an authority figure (Attorney Lee Merritt) to validate its claims while simultaneously inserting a literal red herring (the U.N. poll) into the text. While based on a real event, the framing, word choice, and logical fallacies are all hallmarks of propaganda designed to provoke an emotional response and bypass critical reasoning.
