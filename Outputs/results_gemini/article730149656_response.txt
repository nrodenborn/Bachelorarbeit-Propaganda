1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Steve Anderson an “Anti-Semite Pastor” and describes Sofian Zakkout’s agenda as “bigoted and radical.” It also associates Zakkout with those who call Jews “monkeys and pigs” and “Satan.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The central idea that Sofian Zakkout is an anti-Semite and an extremist is repeated throughout the text by citing multiple examples of his associations (Anderson, Duke, Farrakhan, Hamas).
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate its message. It quotes a slogan used by others (“We are Hamas”) but does not employ its own.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text links Zakkout to terrorism (“ardent supporter of the terrorist organization Hamas”) and describes his presence on the boards as a “documented threat to national security,” aiming to instill fear in the audience.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text explicitly questions the credibility of the anti-crime organizations Zakkout is a part of: “why would groups committed to fighting crime continue to compromise themselves and sabotage their mission by affiliating with him?”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text describes Zakkout’s presence on the boards as an “obscene travesty,” which is an exaggeration used for emotional effect.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing Zakkout as a “documented threat to national security” and calls on the organizations to fulfill their mission of “protecting and safeguarding the American public.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases such as “venomous,” “bigotry,” “obscene travesty,” “hate,” and “mass murder” to evoke a strong emotional response from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text repeatedly associates Zakkout with widely hated figures and groups, including a former KKK leader (David Duke), a Holocaust denier, and the terrorist organization Hamas, to discredit him.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that the reader should agree with its position because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text itself does not assume a simple cause for a complex event; rather, it quotes Steve Anderson using this technique by claiming Jewish persecution is due to a curse from God.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very specific, providing names, dates, direct quotes, and organizational affiliations.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a recognized authority on the subject, having denounced both Anderson and Zakkout.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy: either the crime-stopper groups “cut ties with Sofian Zakkout” or they are choosing to be “associated with anti-Semitism or white supremacism or Hamas or Holocaust denial.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to end discussion; instead, it builds an argument to persuade the reader.
16. Red herring – No – All the information presented, however biased, is relevant to the central argument against Sofian Zakkout.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an opposing argument; it focuses entirely on building its own case against Zakkout.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text makes direct accusations and does not attempt to deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally, but to persuade the audience to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint and to incite action against an individual and the organizations he is affiliated with. This is achieved through a heavy-handed and combined use of numerous propaganda techniques.

The piece is entirely one-sided, presenting a curated list of accusations without any attempt at balance, context, or comment from the accused. It relies heavily on emotional manipulation through Loaded Language (“venomous,” “obscene travesty”) and Appeal to Fear (linking Zakkout to terrorism and a “threat to national security”). It uses Name Calling and Reduction ad Hitlerum extensively, associating Zakkout with universally condemned figures (KKK leader, Holocaust deniers) and groups (Hamas) to demonize him by association. Finally, it presents a Black & White Fallacy, demanding a specific action (his removal) as the only acceptable moral choice. While the text may present factual information (e.g., verifiable Facebook posts), the selection, framing, and emotionally charged presentation of these facts are all hallmarks of a targeted propaganda piece.
