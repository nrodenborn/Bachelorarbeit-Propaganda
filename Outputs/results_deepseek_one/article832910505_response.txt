Based on the definitions provided and analysis of the text, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – Explanation: "Mueller circus," "the swamp," "Obama/Clinton team" are used as insulting labels to attack the investigation, the political establishment, and political opponents.
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "Mueller circus" is repeated multiple times ("The Mueller circus...", "Long Live the Mueller Circus", "The Mueller circus cost...").
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – Explanation: "The Mueller circus is over, long live the Mueller circus" is a brief, memorable phrase used as a slogan framing the entire piece.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Explanation: The text instills fear by suggesting the investigations aim to "punish the voting public" and bring the country "closer to a proper Roman circus," implying chaos and retribution for electing Trump.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – Explanation: The text directly questions the credibility of the Mueller report ("its inevitable lies, smears and assaults") and the motivations behind the investigations ("violation of all political norms and ethics").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Explanation: Claims the media made "ten times that more" than the investigation cost taxpayers and that the profits are "priceless" are unsubstantiated exaggerations. Minimizes the legitimacy of the investigations by labeling them a "coup" and part of a "Roman circus".
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to identity by referencing "the voting public" being punished for electing Trump and framing the investigations as an attack on the people's choice. "The swamp" is a common identifier for a corrupt establishment opposed to "the people".
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Explanation: Uses highly emotional and negative language throughout: "circus," "inevitable lies, smears and assaults," "coup," "spite," "malice," "tribal rage," "punish," "grim face," "violation".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – Explanation: The text does not compare its targets to Nazis or Hitler. While "coup" is strong, it doesn't invoke specific, universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – Explanation: The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea to persuade. It focuses on attacking opponents and their motives.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Explanation: Reduces the complex motivations for multiple investigations into three simple, malicious goals driven by media profit, undermining Trump, and punishing voters ("The three goals of all this are simple...").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes** – Explanation: Uses deliberately vague terms like "the swamp" and "proper Roman circus" without clear definition, relying on implied negative connotations.
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – Explanation: The text does not cite any authority figure or institution to support its claims. It relies on its own assertions.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Explanation: Presents the situation as a binary conflict: the "swamp"/Democrats/media driven by "spite," "malice," and "tribal rage" solely to undermine Trump and punish his voters vs. Trump and the voting public as victims. Ignores legitimate oversight functions or complex political realities.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Explanation: Uses phrases like "the swamp," "Mueller circus," and "tribal rage" as shorthand that shuts down nuanced discussion about the legitimacy, findings, or purposes of the investigations.
16. **Red herring – No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on its core grievance (the investigations and their alleged motives) and does not introduce a significantly distracting, irrelevant topic.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Explanation: Characterizes the "resistance" solely as being built on "tribal rage," oversimplifying and misrepresenting the diverse and complex reasons for opposing Trump. Presents the investigations purely as a malicious "coup" and fundraising scheme, ignoring potential legal or oversight justifications.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – Explanation: The text does not charge its opponents (Democrats, media, investigators) with hypocrisy by pointing to their own past actions. It attacks their *current* alleged motives and actions.

**Verdict – 95% – Explanation:** The text exhibits a very high concentration of propaganda techniques. It relies heavily on name-calling, loaded language, fear appeals, exaggeration, and simplification to paint a one-sided, emotionally charged narrative. Key hallmarks include:
*   **Demonization:** Labels opponents ("swamp," "circus," "coup") and attributes malicious intent ("spite," "malice," "punish the voters").
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** Uses inflammatory language throughout to provoke anger and resentment.
*   **Simplification:** Reduces complex political events and investigations to simple, nefarious plots driven by greed and hatred.
*   **Lack of Evidence/Reasoning:** Makes strong claims (e.g., media profits "ten times" the cost, investigations exist to "punish" voters) without providing evidence or logical reasoning, relying instead on repetition and emotional appeal.
*   **Us vs. Them Framing:** Clearly divides the world into the virtuous "voting public"/Trump and the corrupt, malicious "swamp"/Democrats/media/"resistance".
*   **Goal:** The primary goal appears to be discrediting the Mueller investigation, subsequent probes, and political opponents, while rallying support for Trump by framing him and his voters as victims of a vast, corrupt conspiracy. This aligns strongly with the purpose of propaganda: to promote a specific viewpoint and discredit alternatives, often bypassing rational analysis. The near-ubiquitous use of the listed techniques confirms its propagandistic nature. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges that interpretations can vary, but the overwhelming evidence points to propaganda.
