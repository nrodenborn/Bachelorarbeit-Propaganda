1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Senator Rob Portman stating, "The Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran." The word "desperate" is used as an insulting label to attack the administration's motives and character.
2. Repetition – Yes – The central accusation that the Obama administration tried to help Iran access the US financial system to bypass sanctions is repeated. It appears in the headline, the first paragraph ("secretly trying to give Tehran access to the US financial system"), and in Senator Portman's quote.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The report's stated goal is to make clear to European allies that "doing business with Iran is no longer permissible." This implies negative consequences (sanctions), instilling fear to influence their behavior. The overall narrative of secretly helping Iran also plays on fears regarding national security.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built around the GOP report's effort to question the Obama administration's credibility. Phrases like "secretly trying," "didn't tell Congress," and "misled the American people" are used to cast doubt on the administration's honesty and actions.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text reports on the use of this technique. A former official, Jarrett Blanc, is quoted as saying the story "is widely overblown," which is an attempt to minimize the event's significance. Conversely, the GOP report is accused of exaggerating a "one-time effort" into a major attempt to give Iran broad financial access.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The quote, "The Obama administration misled the American people and Congress," appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a betrayal of the nation and its citizens.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the audience's perception. Examples include "secretly trying," "eagerness," "desperate," and "dodge sanctions," all of which frame the Obama administration's actions in a negative light.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not contain any comparisons to groups hated by the audience, such as the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea or suggest that "everyone" believes it.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text quotes Senator Portman attributing the administration's complex actions to a single, simple cause: "they were desperate to get a deal with Iran." This simplifies the multifaceted geopolitical reasoning behind the nuclear deal.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is not deliberately vague; it attempts to explain a complex financial and political situation. It does, however, report on accusations that the Obama administration was not transparent ("didn't tell Congress").
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article heavily relies on the authority of the "GOP report" from the "Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation" to make its case. It also uses the authority of "former Obama administration officials" to present the counter-argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The GOP report's argument, as presented, creates a false dichotomy: either you support the complete financial isolation of Iran, or you are helping them "dodge sanctions." This ignores the more nuanced position presented by Obama officials, which was to fulfill a specific, legal obligation of the JCPOA.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases or clichés that are designed to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main point. The mention of President Trump and European allies provides context for the timing of the report's release.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text relays the accusation that the GOP report uses a straw man. Obama officials claim Republicans are "trying to make a one-time effort to meet obligations under the nuclear deal sound like an attempt to give Iran broad access to the US financial system." The report attacks the broader, more frightening idea of giving Iran full access, rather than the more limited and specific action that was considered.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain any instances of charging an opponent with hypocrisy by pointing to another issue.

Verdict – 80% – The text is a news article reporting on the release of a political report, and that report is a clear piece of propaganda. While the article adheres to journalistic standards by including a rebuttal from the opposing side, its structure and language heavily amplify the propaganda. The headline ("GOP report: Obama admin worked to allow Iran to exchange billions to bypass sanctions") and the lead paragraph frame the story using the propagandistic claims of the GOP report, employing loaded language ("secretly," "bypass sanctions"). The article gives prominence to quotes that use techniques like name-calling, causal oversimplification, and appeals to fear. Therefore, while not creating the propaganda itself, the article acts as a powerful vehicle for its dissemination, and its framing choices favor the propagandistic narrative over a more neutral presentation of a political dispute.
