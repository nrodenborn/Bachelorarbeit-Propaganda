Verdict – 60% – The text contains several propaganda techniques such as name calling, repetition, slogans, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, and appeal to authority. These elements suggest an attempt to influence public perception of the investigation and its participants.

Therefore, while there are clear elements of propaganda, the presence of multiple perspectives reduces the overall likelihood of the text being purely propagandistic.
