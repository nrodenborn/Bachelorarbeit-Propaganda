Based on the definitions provided and the text "The Hammond Pardons Bring Justice to Obama's Victims", here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "overzealous appeal" (referring to the Obama administration's legal action), "unqualified" (referring to Judge Aiken).
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – Repeated emphasis on the 5-year sentence, the Hammonds' imprisonment, and the Obama administration's role ("The previous administration, however, filed...", "the same administration that...", "But the Obama administration appealed...").
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "cleanse another stain from our nation's history in the dark years of Obama."
4.  **Appeal to fear – Indirectly Yes** – Portrays the Obama administration's actions as creating an unjust, dark period ("dark years of Obama"), implying a threat to justice and ranchers/values.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – "The evidence at trial regarding the Hammonds’ responsibility for the fire was conflicting," and repeatedly questioning the motives and fairness of the Obama administration, media, and Judge Aiken.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – "very deliberately misreported", "shrugging at the murder", "buried the story", "failed to provide any meaningful information" (exaggerating media bias/incompetence). "leaked onto a small portion" (minimizing the fire's scope).
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – "cleanse another stain from our nation's history", "bring justice", appeals to national values of fairness and rectifying historical wrongs.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "misreported", "ridiculing", "shrugging at the murder", "buried", "damaging to Obama", "didn't care", "overzealous appeal", "unjust", "outrage", "unqualified", "stain", "dark years". These words carry strong negative connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparison to Hitler or Nazis is made.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – While it mentions "voices asking him for justice," it doesn't primarily appeal to the idea's popularity as the reason to accept it. Focus is on perceived injustice and contrasting administrations.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Blames the entire unjust outcome primarily on the Obama administration's appeal ("The previous administration, however, filed an overzealous appeal that resulted in..."), oversimplifying the complex legal process (involving laws, judges, appeals courts).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The arguments, while biased, are presented clearly and directly. Terms like "overzealous" are loaded but not vague in intent.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Cites Federal Judge Michael Robert Hogan's original sentencing opinion ("arguing that the mandatory minimums were unjust") to support the claim that the sentences were disproportionate.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents a stark contrast: Obama administration = unjust, locks up ranchers, pardons drug dealers; Trump administration = just, pardons ranchers, locks up drug dealers. Ignores nuance or other factors.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "This was unjust." This simple, definitive statement shuts down further critical examination of the complex legal situation.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – Introducing Obama's stance on mandatory minimums for drug dealers ("The same administration that was against mandatory minimums for its drug dealers and gang members...") is irrelevant to the specific legal merits of the Hammonds' case under the antiterrorism law and serves to attack Obama's hypocrisy.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Characterizes the media's coverage as "very deliberately misreported", "ridiculing", "shrugging at the murder", "buried the story", and failing to provide background "because it would have been damaging to Obama" and "they didn't care." This misrepresents or exaggerates the media's likely motivations and actions to make them easier to dismiss.
18. **Whataboutism – Yes** – "While Obama pardoned drug dealers and locked up ranchers, Trump pardons ranchers and locks up drug dealers." This directly charges the Obama administration with hypocrisy regarding mandatory minimums/pardons to deflect from or minimize criticism of Trump's action, without arguing the Hammonds' pardon on its own specific merits.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text employs a significant number of propaganda techniques (14 out of 18 identified) very effectively. Its core purpose is not simply to report the pardons but to aggressively frame them as righteous justice correcting the deliberate injustices of the Obama era. It achieves this through heavy use of **Loaded Language**, **Name Calling**, **Doubt**, and **Black & White Fallacy** to vilify the Obama administration, the media, and a specific judge while glorifying Trump's action. Techniques like **Repetition**, **Exaggeration**, **Causal Oversimplification**, **Straw Men**, **Whataboutism**, and **Thought-terminating clichés** are used to oversimplify a complex legal case, distort opposing viewpoints, distract with irrelevant comparisons, and shut down critical thought. While it contains factual elements (e.g., the pardons, the sentences, the judges involved, the law used), these facts are selectively presented and embedded within a highly biased narrative designed to provoke strong emotional reactions (outrage at Obama, approval for Trump) rather than foster a nuanced understanding. The pervasive use of these manipulative techniques strongly indicates the text's primary function is propagandistic persuasion.
