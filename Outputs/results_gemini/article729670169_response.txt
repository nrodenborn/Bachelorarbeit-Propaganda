1. Name calling – No – The text uses factual descriptions (e.g., "bankrupt U.S. territory") rather than insulting labels to attack a subject.
2. Repetition – No – While figures are mentioned more than once to provide context and detail, no single persuasive message is repeated to influence the reader.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases intended for mass appeal.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text describes the "cataclysmic damage" from the hurricane as a factual basis for the aid, not to instill fear about an alternative course of action.
5. Doubt – No – The article reports statements from officials without questioning their credibility.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text provides a balanced view by stating the amount of aid received ($16 billion) while also contextualizing it against the larger amount requested ($94.4 billion), thus avoiding either exaggeration or minimization.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions national entities like the "U.S. President" and "U.S. Congress" as part of its factual reporting, not as an appeal to patriotism.
8. Loaded Language – No – The language is overwhelmingly neutral and journalistic. Words like "destroyed" and "cataclysmic" are used as factual descriptors of the hurricane's severe impact, not to manipulate emotion.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text makes no comparisons to hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The article does not suggest that an idea is valid because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text attributes the need for aid to a clear cause (Hurricane Maria) and provides relevant context (pre-existing bankruptcy, informal housing) rather than simplifying a complex issue.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is highly specific, using precise figures, program names (CDBG), and sources to provide clear information.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text quotes authorities (Governor Rossello, Congresswoman Gonzalez) to report their statements and actions, which is standard journalistic sourcing, not a fallacy used to prove a point.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text avoids presenting only two options, mentioning that Puerto Rico is eligible for other programs and that "Congress could also appropriate more money later."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text is informative and does not use any phrases designed to shut down discussion.
16. Red herring – No – All information provided, including Puerto Rico's bankruptcy and the total scope of the disaster bill, is relevant context.
17. Straw men – No – The text is a report and does not construct or refute any arguments.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any party of hypocrisy to deflect from an issue.
