### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Technique Use**: 13/18 techniques are present, including name-calling, fear appeals, loaded language, and religious demonization.  
2. **Dehumanization**: Labels like "frightened puppy" and "Muslim abuser" strip Ellison of humanity.  
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded terms ("demonic," "hounded") and fear-based framing override factual discourse.  
4. **Distortion of Evidence**: Selective use of documents/tweets while dismissing Ellison’s denials.  
5. **Partisan Agenda**: Framing Democrats as hypocritical enablers pushes ideological bias.  
6. **Call to Action**: Urges readers to deny Ellison votes based on unproven allegations amplified by inflammatory rhetoric.  

**Why not 100%?**  
The core allegations (police reports) are factual, but their presentation is weaponized through propagandistic framing. The text prioritizes discrediting Ellison over balanced reporting, fulfilling propaganda’s core function: to manipulate perception through emotionally charged, partisan narrative.
