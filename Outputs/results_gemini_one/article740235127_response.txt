Name calling – No – The text criticizes the nominees based on their alleged actions and policy stances (e.g., "advocating for war," "oversaw an illegal black ops operation"), but it does not attack them with simple insulting labels.

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses Senator Paul's quote, "I'll do whatever it takes," to emphasize his commitment to blocking the nominations. Example: "Paul told CNN’s “State of the Union” and CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that he would do "whatever it takes,"... On "State of the Union," Paul added, "I'll do whatever it takes, and that includes filibuster" to block their confirmation."

Slogans – Yes – The phrase "whatever it takes" is used as a brief and memorable phrase to encapsulate Senator Paul's position and determination. Example: "I'll do "Whatever It Takes" To Block Haspel & Pompeo"

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that confirming Pompeo will lead to war and that people who support the nominees are ignoring a grave warning. Example: "You really want a diplomat to be in charge of the State Department, not someone who is advocating for war."

Doubt – Yes – The author explicitly questions the credibility of media reports and the CIA, as well as the value of President Trump's endorsement. Example: "...just keep in mind that a former journalist, who is now dead, told the world that the media lies for the CIA. So, I'm wary of media reports that claim there have been results from the tactics used."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author minimizes the threat posed by North Korea to support the argument against a hawkish Secretary of State. Example: "Do I believe we should be concerned about North Korea? Sure, but I'm hardly worried that they will actually attack us."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of American identity and values to argue against torture. Example: "I don't think torture is what America is about."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the reader's opinion of the nominees. Example: "She oversaw an illegal black ops operation in Thailand that included torture."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups to discredit the nominees or their supporters.

Bandwagon – No – The text does the opposite of a bandwagon appeal, suggesting that the author's and Senator Paul's viewpoint is an unpopular one held against the majority. Example: "...it seems that many Americans are just fine with these types of people being in these types of offices."

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author attributes the public's support for the nominees to a single, simple cause: ignorance. Example: "The only thing I can think for that kind of reasoning is that people do not know their Constitution and understand exactly what Senator Paul is trying to warn America about."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The author makes a serious claim about the media and CIA but supports it with a vague, unverifiable source. Example: "...a former journalist, who is now dead, told the world that the media lies for the CIA."

Appeal to authority – Yes – The entire article uses Senator Rand Paul as the primary authority to validate its arguments against the nominees. Example: "Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) has expressed some of my thoughts... He's right, too."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents Pompeo as a choice between two extremes, a diplomat or a war advocate, ignoring any potential nuance in his position. Example: “You really want a diplomat to be in charge of the State Department, not someone who is advocating for war.”

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down debate; rather, it attempts to provoke debate, albeit from a biased perspective.

Red herring – Yes – When discussing Trump's praise for the nominees, the author introduces the irrelevant issue of his administration's high turnover rate to distract and cast general doubt. Example: "Trump has obviously had praise for both Pompeo and Haspel, but then again, his administration has quite a bit of turn over too."

Straw men – No – The text engages with the actual records and stated positions of the nominees (Haspel's connection to torture, Pompeo's advocacy for regime change) rather than misrepresenting their arguments.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to discredit its targets by accusing them of hypocrisy on an unrelated issue.

***

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it takes the form of an opinion piece, it employs a significant majority (12 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques to persuade the reader, rather than to inform them neutrally. The piece is built on an appeal to the authority of Senator Rand Paul, using his statements to frame the entire argument. It then layers on numerous other techniques, including appealing to fear (of war), flag-waving (defining what "America is about"), using loaded language ("torture," "illegal black ops"), and casting doubt on the credibility of any opposing information (media, CIA). The author simplifies the motives of opponents through causal oversimplification (they are ignorant of the Constitution) and presents false dichotomies (diplomat vs. war advocate). The clear, one-sided goal is to manipulate the reader into adopting a specific political position, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
