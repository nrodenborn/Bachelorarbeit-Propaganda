### Verdict – 20% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is primarily **factual reporting**: It details an arrest, warrant, and standard procedures without overt emotional manipulation or persuasive intent. However, the term "illegal alien" (vs. neutral alternatives like "undocumented immigrant") carries **loaded connotations**, subtly framing the subject through a lens of criminality. This word choice aligns with political narratives that conflate immigration status with inherent threat, introducing a minor propagandistic element. Despite this, the absence of fear-mongering, oversimplification, or other techniques keeps the piece largely informational. The 20% likelihood reflects this terminological bias within an otherwise neutral report.
