**Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, flag-waving, loaded language, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to portray Archbishop Viganò as a heroic figure standing against a corrupt and dangerous papacy, thereby influencing the audience's perception of the situation. While not all techniques are present, the use of multiple methods suggests a significant likelihood of the text being propaganda.**
