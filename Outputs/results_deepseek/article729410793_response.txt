1. **Name calling** – Yes – "sacrilegious" (used by Cordes to describe Marx’s proposal).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Multiple references to Church doctrine (e.g., "intrinsically disordered," "contrary to natural law") to reinforce opposition.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "truth will make us free" (used by Chaput to dismiss dissent).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings that blessings would "lead persons away from God" and cause "spiritual damage."  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questioning Marx’s translation/position: "his office contacted the outlet and said they had mistranslated."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "sacrilegious"; Minimization: Marx’s proposal reduced to enabling "gravely sinful" acts.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeal to national/group identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "sacrilegious," "sodomy," "gravely sinful," "intrinsically disordered."

14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Chaput’s dichotomy: "no real mercy... without truth" implies no middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "truth will make us free" (used to end debate).  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions.

### Verdict – 75% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** (75%) due to:  
1. **Selective Framing**: Exclusively amplifies traditionalist perspectives (Cordes, Chaput, Catechism) while marginalizing Marx’s pastoral intent.  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses fear ("spiritually damaging"), loaded language ("sacrilegious"), and moral absolutism to vilify same-sex unions.  
3. **Appeals to Authority**: Relies on doctrinal citations to imply incontrovertibility, dismissing alternative interpretations.  
4. **Omission of Nuance**: Downplays Marx’s emphasis on "individual pastoral care" and the translation dispute, framing his view as a radical breach.  
5. **Binary Morality**: Chaput’s argument reduces the issue to "truth vs. false mercy," suppressing dialogue.  

However, it avoids overt techniques like *straw men* or *whataboutism*, and reports factual elements (e.g., Marx’s retranslation request). Its primary goal is to delegitimize progressive theology using doctrinal authority and emotive condemnation, aligning with advocacy rather than balanced reporting.
