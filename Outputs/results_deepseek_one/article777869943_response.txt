Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the given text:

1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation:* The text describes the compound as "filthy," "wretched," and "horrid," but these are factual descriptors of observed conditions (e.g., "a filthy compound," "wretched compound," "horrid compound"). They are not used as insulting labels to attack a subject without evidence.  

2. **Repetition** – No  
   *Explanation:* No specific phrase or message is repeated throughout the text to reinforce a particular idea. The narrative progresses linearly without redundant emphasis.  

3. **Slogans** – No  
   *Explanation:* There are no brief, memorable phrases designed for persuasion (e.g., no rallying cries like "BUILD THE WALL").  

4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
   *Explanation:* While the content is disturbing (e.g., "starving children," "remains," "weapons"), it reports facts without exploiting fear to promote a specific agenda or alternative.  

5. **Doubt** – No  
   *Explanation:* The text does not question the credibility of individuals or institutions. It presents statements from authorities (e.g., the sheriff) and witnesses neutrally.  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No  
   *Explanation:* Descriptions like "starving children," "saddest living conditions," and "horrifying scene" align with direct quotes from officials and witnesses. No clear exaggeration or minimization is evident.  

7. **Flag-Waving** – No  
   *Explanation:* There are no appeals to patriotism, national identity, or collective unity (e.g., no phrases like "We the People" or calls to national action).  

8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation:* Emotionally charged words like "horrid," "horrifying," "wretched," and "starving" are used to evoke strong reactions (e.g., "the horrid compound," "horrifying scene," "11 starving children"). While based on reports, these terms amplify emotional impact beyond neutral description.  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *Explanation:* No comparisons to Nazis, extremist groups, or historically hated entities.  

10. **Bandwagon** – No  
    *Explanation:* No appeals to the popularity of an idea or action (e.g., no "everyone agrees" statements).  

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No  
    *Explanation:* The text avoids attributing the tragedy to a single cause. It explores multiple factors (e.g., lack of probable cause, failed surveillance).  

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No  
    *Explanation:* The reporting is clear and specific (e.g., dates, locations, direct quotes). No deliberate confusion is present.  

13. **Appeal to authority** – No  
    *Explanation:* Authorities (e.g., Sheriff Hogrefe) are cited for factual accounts, not to validate an argument. Example: "Hogrefe said... because they did not believe they had probable cause."  

14. **Black & white fallacy** – No  
    *Explanation:* The text acknowledges complexity (e.g., police constraints vs. neighbors' frustrations) without presenting false dichotomies.  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No  
    *Explanation:* No phrases are used to shut down critical discussion (e.g., no "case closed" assertions).  

16. **Red herring** – No  
    *Explanation:* All details relate directly to the compound case. No irrelevant distractions are introduced.  

17. **Straw men** – No  
    *Explanation:* No misrepresented arguments are refuted. The text reports perspectives without distortion.  

18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    *Explanation:* No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no "what about X group?" comparisons).

**Verdict – 10% –**  
The text is primarily a factual news report from CNN, detailing events surrounding a New Mexico compound, witness accounts, and official statements. While loaded language (e.g., "horrid," "starving") adds emotional weight, it aligns with described conditions and serves descriptive rather than overtly manipulative purposes. There is no clear agenda to persuade, promote ideology, or distort reality. Instead, the piece presents multiple viewpoints (e.g., neighbors criticizing police, police explaining legal constraints) and avoids most propaganda hallmarks. The 10% likelihood reflects minor emotional framing, but the core content remains journalistic.
