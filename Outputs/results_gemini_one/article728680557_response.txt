Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to describe modern society, which is implicitly the alternative to the Church's teaching. Example: "a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.”

Repetition – Yes – The full name of the document is repeated multiple times to reinforce its importance. Example: "‘Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage’" is mentioned three times.

Slogans – No – While phrases are repeated, none are brief and catchy enough to be considered a slogan in the context of the definition.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear about the state of society to support the bishops' position. Example: "a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.”

Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any specific person or group; it affirms its own position.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to describe the state of modern society. Example: "divorce has become a plague"

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the identity and values of faithful Catholics to rally support for the profession. Example: "it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo-pagan society"

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's perception. Example: "Immutable Truths," "sanctity," "plague," and "sexual depravity."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text emphasizes the growing number of signatories to suggest that the idea is becoming more popular and should be joined. Example: "Bishop Fischer is the tenth prelate to sign the profession." and "brings the number of signatories to nine bishops and one cardinal."

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not attempt to explain the cause of a complex event.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is specific, naming the individuals, the document, and the dates involved.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The entire article is built on the authority of the signatories to validate the "Profession." Example: "His Excellency Elmar Fischer, bishop emeritus of Feldkirch, Austria, has signed..." The text then lists numerous other prelates with their full titles.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a choice between upholding the "Immutable Truths" of the Church or succumbing to a "neo-pagan society," ignoring any other possibilities or nuances. Example: The framing of the "Profession" as a defense against a society where "divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The name of the document itself is a phrase that discourages critical thought. Example: "Profession of Immutable Truths" implies the subject is beyond debate or questioning because it consists of "truths" that are "immutable."

Red herring – No – The text stays focused on the topic of the bishops signing the document and does not introduce irrelevant material.

Straw men – No – The text does not create and refute a false argument from an opponent; it simply states its own position.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 90% – The text is presented as a news report, but its primary function is persuasion, not neutral information delivery. It employs a significant number of propaganda techniques, including Appeal to Authority, Bandwagon, Loaded Language, and Appeal to Fear. The article's structure is designed to build momentum for a cause by highlighting the growing list of authoritative figures who support it (Bandwagon, Appeal to Authority). It frames the issue as a righteous stand against a morally corrupt society, using emotionally charged and exaggerated language ("plague," "sexual depravity," "neo-pagan") to evoke a strong emotional response. The very name of the document, "Profession of Immutable Truths," is a thought-terminating cliché designed to shut down debate. While it reports on a factual event (bishops signing a document), the framing, word choice, and selective presentation of information are all geared towards promoting a specific ideological viewpoint, making it a clear example of propaganda.
