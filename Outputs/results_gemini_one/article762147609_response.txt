1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses the full name "Barack Hussein Obama" in the title, a common tactic to subtly associate him with foreignness in a negative way. It also refers to Iran as a "rogue nation."
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the idea of secrecy and deception. Examples include: "secretly paved the way," "quietly gave a special license," "cutting quiet deals, behind closed doors," "secretly mobilized," "discreetly issued a special license," and "calculated and secretive efforts."
3. Slogans – No – The text is written in an article format and does not employ brief, memorable phrases as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text links Iran to terrorism and nuclear weapons to instill fear. Example: "She also called on foreign governments to harden their financial systems against “deceptive” Iranian transactions that ultimately channel money to terrorists."
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire premise of the article is to question the credibility and honesty of the Obama administration. Example: "The Obama administration — despite repeatedly assuring Congress that Iran would remain barred from the U.S. financial system — secretly mobilized to give Tehran access to American banks..."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the benefit to Iran by using terms like "windfall" and "massive U.S. currency conversion," while minimizing the fact that the transaction was ultimately unsuccessful. Example: "Despite the Obama administration’s efforts, Iran was ultimately forced to convert its Bank Muscat assets to euros in small increments using European banks and without accessing the U.S. financial system..."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a deception of the American public. Example: "Barack Obama spent considerable time selling the American people on the idea of a cooperative Iran — all the while cutting quiet deals, behind closed doors, with the rogue nation."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader. Examples include "rogue nation," "windfall," "deceptive," "terrorists," and "suspect nuclear programs."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea as a reason for its acceptance.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple, negative motive for the Obama administration's complex foreign policy actions. Example: "the Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is not intentionally vague; it makes very specific accusations. It accuses the Obama administration of this, but does not use the technique itself.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text bases its entire argument on the authority of a partisan government report and officials. Example: "A new Senate report reveals that Barack Obama secretly paved the way for Iran to tap into U.S. banks..."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a simple binary: the Trump administration's "harsh" and correct approach versus the Obama administration's "deceptive" and wrong approach, ignoring the nuances of international diplomacy. Example: The article consistently contrasts the Trump administration's tough stance with the Obama administration's alleged secret dealings.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to discourage critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central claim and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract.
17. Straw men – No – The text attacks the Obama administration's actual public statements by contrasting them with alleged secret actions, rather than refuting a fabricated argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses its criticism on the Obama administration and does not deflect from another issue.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. While it adopts the structure of a news report, it employs a significant number of propaganda techniques to promote a specific political agenda. The piece is built entirely on a one-sided source (a "Republican-led" subcommittee report) and uses this "Appeal to Authority" to lend credibility to its claims. It consistently uses "Loaded Language" ("rogue nation," "windfall"), "Repetition" (of words like "secretly" and "misled"), and "Name Calling" (the use of "Barack Hussein Obama") to create a negative emotional impression. The core purpose is to create "Doubt" about a former political leader and his administration's integrity. Furthermore, it uses "Appeal to Fear" by linking the events to terrorism and nuclear threats. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent not to inform objectively, but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of the Obama administration's actions regarding Iran.
