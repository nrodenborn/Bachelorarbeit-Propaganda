**Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These elements suggest a strong bias and an attempt to persuade the audience by using emotional and manipulative tactics. However, the text also provides detailed accounts and specific examples, which adds some level of credibility and complexity to the narrative. Overall, while the text contains factual elements, the presence of multiple propaganda techniques indicates a high likelihood of it being propaganda.**
