**Verdict – 5% –** The text is a straightforward news report with no overt propaganda techniques. It neutrally recounts facts: Douglas Haig’s sale of ammunition to the Las Vegas shooter, his lack of suspicion, legal clarifications, and investigative details. Sources (lawyer, law enforcement, expert) are cited objectively, and the tone avoids emotional manipulation, exaggeration, or persuasive framing. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges that any report involving mass shootings could subtly influence public perception, but this article prioritizes factual accuracy and transparency (e.g., noting redactions, legal context) over agenda-driven messaging.
