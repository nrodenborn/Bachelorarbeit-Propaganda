1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the government as the "federal beast" and opponents of 3D-printed guns as "gun grabbing Communists."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – Yes – The title itself, "DOJ Surrenders," acts as a brief and memorable phrase to frame the entire story as a victory in a conflict.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses more on celebrating a victory and stoking anger against opponents rather than instilling fear in the audience about what might happen if the other side wins.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the effectiveness of the NRA by quoting Cody Wilson: "What has the NRA done for you lately?"
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text quotes Cody Wilson boasting that his efforts have "officially killed gun control," which is a significant exaggeration of the legal settlement's impact.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue around the First and Second Amendments and calling the event "a huge milestone in the history of our county."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical phrases such as "federal beast," "intimidation tactics," and "gun grabbing Communists" to evoke strong emotional responses.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of gun control by associating it with a group hated by the target audience: "gun grabbing Communists."
10. Bandwagon – No – The text frames the story as an underdog victory of a few individuals against a large entity, rather than suggesting an idea is good simply because it is already popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple cause for a complex issue by stating that this single legal settlement means "the genie is out of the bottle and there is just no way for gun grabbing Communists the world over to be able to truly enforce their unlawful acts."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; its position and message are very direct and clear.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses a press release from the "Second Amendment Foundation" and quotes its founder, Alan M. Gottlieb, as an authority to support its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the issue as a simple conflict between freedom-loving individuals and "gun grabbing Communists," ignoring any nuanced positions on gun control.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase "the genie is out of the bottle" to discourage further discussion by implying the outcome is now irreversible.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll about Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation, which is completely irrelevant to the main topic of 3D-printed guns, serving as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text celebrates that the settlement is a "devastating blow" because it refutes the idea that semi-automatic rifles are "weapons of war." The original legal case, however, was primarily about free speech (First Amendment) and export controls, not the military classification of the weapons (Second Amendment).
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text uses the quote, "What has the NRA done for you lately?" to deflect potential criticism and charge another pro-gun organization with hypocrisy or ineffectiveness.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it reports on a real event (a legal settlement between the DOJ and Defense Distributed), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly ideological viewpoint. This is achieved through the pervasive use of propaganda techniques. The article employs emotionally loaded language and name-calling ("federal beast," "gun grabbing Communists") to create a clear enemy. It uses flag-waving by constantly referencing the First and Second Amendments and the "history of our county" to align its cause with patriotism. The argument relies on logical fallacies like exaggeration ("officially killed gun control"), causal oversimplification (this settlement permanently ends gun control), and a black & white worldview (freedom vs. communism). Furthermore, it uses structural tricks like a red herring (the irrelevant Kavanaugh poll) and thought-terminating clichés ("the genie is out of the bottle") to control the narrative and discourage critical thought. The sheer density and variety of these techniques demonstrate that the article's intent is to reinforce an ideological position and rally support, not to provide a balanced or objective account of the news.
