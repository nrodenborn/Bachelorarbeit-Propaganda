Name calling – Yes – The text uses the term "'sonic attacks'", which is a label that frames an unexplained phenomenon as a deliberate and hostile act.

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly mentions and draws parallels to the "so-called sonic attacks on U.S. diplomats in Cuba," reinforcing the idea that this is a recurring and threatening pattern. Example: "a case that recalls a wave of so-called sonic attacks on U.S. diplomats in Cuba." and "The medical indications are very similar, and entirely consistent with, the medical indications that were taking place to Americans working in Cuba."

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text is built around a "health alert" and details alarming medical symptoms like "mild traumatic brain injury," "hearing loss," "cognitive disruption, and brain swelling" to instill fear and concern about a mysterious threat.

Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of anyone or anything; it primarily reports the statements of U.S. officials.

Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text reports on "mild" traumatic brain injury and "subtle and vague" sensations, which appears to be a direct report rather than a deliberate exaggeration or minimization.

Flag-Waving – No – While the report concerns U.S. citizens and government employees, it does not use patriotic appeals to persuade the audience.

Loaded Language – Yes – The phrase "'sonic attacks'" is emotionally charged language that presupposes hostile intent for an event whose cause is officially unknown.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text avoids oversimplification by stating the U.S. is "working to determine the cause and impact of the incident" and that details are "still emerging."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text describes a phenomenon that is vague ("subtle and vague...sensations") but is not itself deliberately unclear to confuse the audience.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The article's entire premise and credibility are built on the statements of official sources. Example: "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday during testimony in Congress."

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present a scenario with only two options.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases that discourage critical thought.

Red herring – No – The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main point.

Straw men – No – The text does not refute an argument that was not presented.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge any opponent with hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 60% – The text presents itself as a neutral news report, but it functions as a vehicle for a U.S. State Department narrative that contains clear propagandistic elements. By uncritically amplifying the government's message, the article itself becomes a piece of propaganda. It heavily employs Appeal to Authority, citing only U.S. officials to lend weight to the story. It uses Loaded Language ("sonic attacks") and Appeal to Fear (listing frightening medical symptoms) to frame an unexplained event as a hostile act by an unnamed foreign entity. The Repetition of the link to a similar incident in Cuba reinforces this narrative of a threatening pattern. The article does not include any alternative viewpoints or critical analysis of the government's claims (for instance, that the cause of the Cuban incidents remains scientifically unproven and highly debated), thereby conditioning the reader to accept the official U.S. government interpretation as fact.
