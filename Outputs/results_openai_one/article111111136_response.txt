**Final Verdict**

**Verdict – 70% –** The text displays several propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to shape the reader’s perception of crime in Sweden, particularly in the context of immigration and government response. While the article presents factual information and quotes, the selection and framing of incidents, the emotional language, and the simplification of complex issues suggest a significant likelihood of propaganda intent. However, the presence of factual statistics and direct quotes from officials prevents it from being pure propaganda, placing it at a moderate to high likelihood (70%) of containing propaganda elements.
