### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques:

1. **Name calling** – No  
   Explanation: The text labels Quentin Lamar Smith as a suspect and references his alleged crimes, but does not use explicitly insulting epithets (e.g., "monster," "savage").  

2. **Repetition** – No  
   Explanation: No phrase or idea is repeated excessively; details are stated once for narrative clarity.  

3. **Slogans** – No  
   Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Justice for All") are used to simplify the message.  

4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes  
   Explanation: Quotes Candace Smith’s statement that Quentin threatened to kill her, their daughter, and himself, emphasizing danger to evoke fear.  

5. **Doubt** – Yes  
   Explanation: Questions media integrity by stating, "except for the photograph, there's no mention of the race issue," implying deliberate omission.  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes  
   Explanation: Exaggerates media bias with: "If these two men had survived... you'd be hearing a lot about the race issue," minimizing current reporting while amplifying hypothetical racial double standards.  

7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes  
   Explanation: Calls the slain officers "true American heroes," appealing to patriotism and national identity.  

8. **Loaded Language** – Yes  
   Explanation: Uses emotionally charged terms like "Black Murders Of White Cops" and "always arguing and fighting" to evoke racial tension and moral judgment.  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  

10. **Bandwagon** – No  
    Explanation: Does not appeal to popularity or group consensus.  

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes  
    Explanation: Reduces systemic issues to race alone: Framing the incident as part of "Black Murders Of White Cops" ignores complex socio-legal factors.  

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No  
    Explanation: Details are specific (e.g., dates, charges); no deliberate ambiguity.  

13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes  
    Explanation: Cites police reports and Chief Morbitzer’s statements (e.g., "officers gave their lives in defense of others") to validate the narrative.  

14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes  
    Explanation: Presents a false binary: Media either highlights race (if Smith died) or suppresses it (since cops died), ignoring nuanced reporting.  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No  
    Explanation: No phrases like "case closed" or "end of story" to halt scrutiny.  

16. **Red herring** – Yes  
    Explanation: Shifts focus from the crime to media bias: "If these two men had survived... you'd be hearing a lot about the race issue" distracts from factual reporting.  

17. **Straw men** – Yes  
    Explanation: Misrepresents media priorities: Asserts they would only discuss race if Smith died, refuting an unstated argument about selective outrage.  

18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    Explanation: Does not accuse critics of hypocrisy by referencing unrelated issues.

### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Selective Framing**: It categorizes the incident under "Black Murders Of White Cops" and "Not Reporting Race," framing a tragic event through a racial lens while implying media conspiracy.  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language (e.g., "true American heroes," threats of murder) and appeal to fear stoke outrage and division.  
3. **Logical Fallacies**: Uses black/white fallacy, straw men, and causal oversimplification to reduce the narrative to racial conflict, ignoring broader context (e.g., domestic violence history, police procedure).  
4. **Agenda-Driven Omissions**: Highlights the suspect’s race while downplaying the victim’s statements or police investigations, emphasizing a biased "double standard" narrative.  
5. **Technique Density**: Employs 10/18 propaganda techniques (e.g., loaded language, appeal to authority, red herring), indicating systematic persuasion over factual reporting.  

The text aims to inflame racial tensions by weaponizing a crime to fit a preconceived narrative of anti-white bias, aligning with ideological propaganda objectives.
