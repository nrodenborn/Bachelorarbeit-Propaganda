### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "mainstream hack politician" (referring to Nigel Farage).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated verbatim three times.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans (e.g., no equivalent to "BUILD THE WALL").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Historical quotes about jihad (e.g., "exterminate the infidels," "curse of Allah") are used to instill fear of Islam as an existential threat.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Farage’s credibility: "he appears unaware of the fact..." and "Another problem with Farage’s statement is that it manifests a remarkable ignorance of history."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Historical references are presented as factual evidence without clear overstatement/understatement.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms like "sabotage," "denial and appeasement," "jihad terror," "subjugated," "humiliate," and "contempt."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The poll implies popularity but does not explicitly claim an idea is widely accepted.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes global jihad solely to Islamic texts (e.g., "jihadis find justification for their actions in the Qur’an and Sunnah"), ignoring broader socio-political factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct, not deliberately obscure.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites the author’s own book ("I document this abundantly in my new book") as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents a false dilemma: either discuss Islamic texts openly or "lose" to jihad (e.g., "if we don’t speak about such facts, how will we ever convince Muslims...").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is").  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The poll about "corrupt Democrat Politician[s]" is irrelevant to the topic of Islamic extremism and distracts from Farage’s argument.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents Farage’s stance: Farage warns against framing resistance as a war on all Islam, but the text claims he opposes discussing the Qur’an altogether ("we must not speak about how jihadis find justification...").  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy against Farage or others.  

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely propaganda. It employs numerous techniques (e.g., loaded language, appeal to fear, straw men, red herring) to vilify Nigel Farage and frame Islam as an inherent threat. Historical quotes are selectively used to evoke fear, while the author’s book is cited as unquestionable authority. The irrelevant poll and false dilemmas distract from nuanced debate, and the overall tone is polemical rather than analytical. Though it references factual sources, their presentation is manipulative, aiming to provoke anti-Islamic sentiment and discredit Farage’s stance. The lack of balanced context (e.g., ignoring moderate Muslim perspectives) further signals propagandistic intent.
