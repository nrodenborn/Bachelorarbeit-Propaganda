1. Name calling – Yes – The author labels opponents as “gun control extremists,” “gun grabbers,” and “little Nazis.” Trump’s statements are called “Stalinist,” and police actions are described as a “Naziesque assault.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the ultimate goal of any gun control is “gun confiscation” is repeated throughout the text, appearing in the first paragraph, the conclusion, and multiple times in between.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text repeatedly uses Donald Trump’s quote, “‘Take the guns first, go through due process second,’” as a memorable phrase to encapsulate the policy it is arguing against.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that without guns, people will be “defenseless” and subject to being “robbed, assaulted, accosted, beaten up, raped, wounded, paralyzed, or killed.” It also raises the fear of a “declaration of war” from a “tyrannical government.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The author systematically questions the credibility of the police report from Seattle, asking, “what does ‘volume of complaints’ mean?” and suggesting the police are not telling the whole story. It also questions the credibility of pastors who teach that Christians should obey the government on this issue.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the actions of law enforcement as a “Naziesque assault” and a “declaration of war.” Conversely, the author minimizes the reported behavior of the man in Seattle, sarcastically stating, “Wow! Run for your lives!” in response to him “staring” at people.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and American identity by referencing “the American people,” “Second Amendment liberties,” “constitutional right,” and addressing “freedom-loving American[s].” It also appeals to a Christian identity in the postscript.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as “extremists,” “egregious,” “Stalinist,” “Naziesque,” “gun grabbers,” and “tyrannical government,” to evoke strong feelings in the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text compares law enforcement actions to a “Naziesque assault” and calls people who complain about guns “little Nazis.” It also uses a similar technique by labeling Trump’s statements as “Stalinist.”
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. In fact, it does the opposite, warning that a dangerous idea (red flag laws) is gaining popularity in many states and urging the reader to oppose the trend.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text claims that the recent push for “red flag” laws in 24 states is a direct result of Trump’s statements, stating they are the “rallying cry” for these laws. This simplifies a complex political movement with many contributing factors down to a single cause.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s language is direct, forceful, and clear in its meaning and intent. It does not use vague or obscure expressions to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites Kris Kobach, a “former professor of constitutional law,” and presents his legal analysis as definitive proof that “red flag” laws are unconstitutional. The postscript also appeals to the authority of God and the Bible.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the issue as a choice between complete gun freedom and total “gun confiscation and prohibition.” It dismisses the possibility of any middle ground or nuanced gun control measures.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The postscript uses phrases such as “it is a sin against God” to surrender guns and that the duty of self-defense is “assigned us in Nature by our Creator.” These are absolute statements designed to end discussion and discourage critical thought on the matter.
16. Red herring – No – The text remains highly focused on its central theme of gun rights, gun control, and the perceived threat of confiscation. It does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author creates a straw man by claiming the goal of “gun control extremists” is not actually control but total “gun confiscation and prohibition.” This refutes the most extreme possible position rather than engaging with the stated, more nuanced arguments for specific laws like “red flag” laws.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text accuses Donald Trump of betraying his promises, but it does not use the technique of deflecting criticism by pointing out the hypocrisy of an opponent (e.g., “You criticize me, but what about what you did?”).

Verdict – 100% – The text is an unambiguous example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly emotional viewpoint and to incite outrage and action. This is achieved through the heavy and combined use of numerous propaganda techniques. The piece employs constant name-calling (“extremists,” “Stalinist,” “Naziesque”) and loaded language to create a strong emotional response. It builds its entire argument on a black & white fallacy, framing any form of gun control as a direct path to total “gun confiscation,” a straw man argument that it repeats relentlessly. The author uses an appeal to fear, warning of a “tyrannical government” and citizens being left “defenseless” against violent crime. It systematically attempts to cast doubt on official sources while simultaneously using an appeal to authority (a constitutional law professor and the Bible) to validate its own claims. The argument is further solidified by causal oversimplification, blaming a complex political trend solely on Trump's statements. The text’s goal is to provoke a strong emotional reaction (“You should be OUTRAGED”) and channel it towards a specific political stance, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
