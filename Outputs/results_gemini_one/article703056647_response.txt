2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the epidemic will worsen or "explode" is repeated. Examples include: "epidemic could explode anytime," "could see the number of those infected explode exponentially," and "the epidemic will get worse before it gets better."
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as a rallying cry or chant.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The article is built around creating fear of the plague spreading. Example: "But the worst news is that the epidemic could explode anytime unleashing the sickness on the globe."
5. Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or group; instead, it uses authorities to build its own credibility.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggerated language to describe the potential growth of the epidemic. Example: "But the oncoming rainy season could see the number of those infected explode exponentially."
7. Flag-Waving – No – While it mentions "British honeymoon paradises" and "British aid workers" to create relevance for a specific audience, it does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is specific, providing numbers, names, and clear reasons for its warnings. It aims for clarity to induce fear, not vagueness to confuse.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly cites official sources to lend credibility to its warnings. Example: "The Foreign Office recently warned that the deadly outbreak is entering its most dangerous phase."

Verdict – 85% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it reports on a real-world event, its primary purpose is not to inform objectively but to persuade the reader of an impending global catastrophe. It achieves this by heavily employing several propaganda techniques. The entire piece is framed as an **Appeal to fear**, using highly **Loaded Language** ("Black Death," "taking to its knees," "unleashing") and **Exaggeration** (the repeated use of "explode") to create a sense of panic. This message is reinforced through **Repetition**. To make these sensational claims seem credible, the article leans heavily on **Appeal to authority**, citing various officials and organizations. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and perception of the event, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
