Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack any person, group, or idea.

Repetition – Yes – The statement "China has always protected the safety of workers at foreign diplomatic missions in China" is stated at the beginning and then paraphrased by the Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang later in the text.

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases designed to be repeated.

Appeal to fear – No – The text reports on a potentially frightening event but does not use fear to support a specific idea against an alternative.

Doubt – Yes – The statement "So far we have not yet found causes or clues to the situation described by the US" is used to question the substance and credibility of the US's report by stating a lack of evidence.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement that it has "not found any trace" and "not yet found causes or clues" serves to minimize the significance or reality of the incident reported by the US.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – No – The text primarily uses neutral, clinical, or descriptive language (e.g., "abnormal sensations of sound and pressure," "mild traumatic brain injury") rather than emotionally charged or stereotypical words.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with a hated group.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text avoids this by explicitly stating that the cause of the symptoms is unknown and unresolved.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is straightforward in its reporting. It quotes sources that describe vague symptoms, but the article itself is not deliberately unclear.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text quotes the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman citing the "Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations" as evidence of China's commitment to protecting diplomats.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present a false dichotomy of only two choices.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "China has always protected the safety of workers at foreign diplomatic missions in China" is a stock phrase used to dismiss concerns and discourage further questioning of China's role or responsibility.

Red herring – No – The mention of the similar incident in Cuba is relevant context, not an irrelevant distraction.

Straw men – No – The text presents a direct response from China to the specific claims made by the US, rather than refuting a distorted or unstated argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not feature one party accusing the other of hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 70% – The text functions as propaganda primarily through its framing and the selective amplification of one perspective. While it maintains the structure of a news report by including statements from both the US and China, its headline, "Probe in consulate injury allegation finds no clues," immediately establishes the Chinese government's conclusion as the definitive takeaway. The article prominently features quotes from the Chinese Foreign Ministry that employ several propaganda techniques (Doubt, Minimization, Appeal to Authority, Thought-terminating clichés) to dismiss the US allegations. These statements are presented as official and authoritative responses. Although the US position is included, it is framed as an unproven "allegation" or a "situation described by the US," whereas the Chinese response is presented as the result of an "earnest investigation." The article is a vehicle for disseminating the Chinese state's official narrative under the guise of objective journalism, making it a subtle but effective piece of propaganda.
