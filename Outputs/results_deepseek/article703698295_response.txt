Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – Examples: "bully-boy Church," "midget bishops," "minicardinals," "cabal" (referring to Pope Francis' supporters), "Kasperian kerfuffle," "blithering incoherence" (describing Müller's writing).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The theme of Fr. Weinandy being punished for expressing concerns is repeated (e.g., "fired," "squashed," "given the boot," "persecution"), and "chronic confusion" is reiterated.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "Great Clarifier" (used to frame Francis' pontificate as revealing weak faith).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings that speaking out leads to being "marginalized or worse," creating fear of reprisal among bishops and faithful.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Undermines Cardinal Müller's credibility: "irresolute and ultimately calculating mind," "desperate attempt to find friends," "selective memory."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "howling tantrums" (German bishops), "blown way, way, WAY out of proportion." Minimization: Dismisses Müller's theological arguments as "puerile" and "trendy buzzwords."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to Catholic identity: "loyal to the Church and Her teaching," "defend the Catholic Faith and faithful," "spirit of truth."  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotional/derogatory terms: "squashed," "outrage," "bully," "sycophancy," "cabal," "cheap and vulgar ritual humiliation."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association of ideas with hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Suggests Fr. Weinandy represents "many Catholics" and "ordinary people" who share his concerns.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes complex Church issues solely to Pope Francis: "caused chronic confusion," "orchestrated the Synods to undermine [Müller]."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are emotionally charged but not deliberately obscure.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites Fr. Weinandy's credentials (Vatican Theological Commission, ex-doctrinal chief) and his divine sign ("Jesus wanted me to write").  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents Fr. Weinandy as "humble," "loyal," and "pastoral" versus Francis' "bully" supporters and "irresolute" Müller.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Phrases like "men of conscience," "brave defenders of the status quo," and "sycophancy stakes" shut down nuance.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Shifts focus to Cardinal Müller's inconsistencies to distract from the Weinandy incident.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents Müller/Kasperian theology: "Presumably because adultery itself is no longer sinful. Or sacrilege either, I guess."  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No direct counter-accusations of hypocrisy against critics.  

---

**Verdict – 75%** – The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements through its pervasive use of loaded language (e.g., "squashed," "cabal"), name-calling ("midget bishops"), and emotional appeals to fear and identity. It selectively frames Fr. Weinandy as a persecuted hero while demonizing Pope Francis and his supporters through exaggeration (e.g., "bully-boy Church") and oversimplification of theological disputes. The reliance on ad hominem attacks (e.g., mocking Müller's motives), straw-man arguments, and bandwagon rhetoric ("ordinary people share these concerns") further aligns with propaganda goals. However, it incorporates factual events (Weinandy's dismissal, Müller's statements) and sourced quotes, preventing a 100% assessment. The primary aim is to persuade readers of a narrative of ecclesial corruption and suppression of dissent, using manipulative techniques to amplify outrage.
