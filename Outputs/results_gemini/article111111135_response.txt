1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Louis Farrakhan referring to “the powerful Jews” as his enemies and the Nation of Islam’s early literature referring to “the white man” as “the white devil.”

2. Repetition – No – The text itself does not repeat a specific message over and over to persuade the reader. It reports on different events and statements over a period of time.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text mentions the Nation of Islam’s early literature used the phrase “the white devil,” which is a brief and memorable phrase used to label a group.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text quotes Louis Farrakhan as saying Jews were “responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men into women and women into men,” which instills fear of a specific group’s influence.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text reports on the controversy and criticism surrounding Tamika Mallory and Representative Danny Davis due to their “reluctance to condemn Mr. Farrakhan,” which inherently questions their judgment and credibility.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text quotes Louis Farrakhan’s claim that Jews were “responsible for *all* of this filth and degenerate behavior,” which is an extreme exaggeration.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text explains the appeal of the Nation of Islam as a “form of radical black self love that is willing to challenge any potential impediment to black freedom,” which is an appeal to racial identity.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text quotes Louis Farrakhan using emotionally charged and stereotypical phrases like “powerful Jews” and “filth and degenerate behavior.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text reports that Farrakhan called Hitler “a very great man,” but the article itself does not use this association to disapprove of an idea; it presents it as a factual part of the controversy surrounding Farrakhan.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text notes that in the 1960s and 70s, “millions of others sympathized with the movement’s anticolonial stance and were inspired by its most famous member, Muhammad Ali,” describing an appeal based on popularity and famous adherents.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text quotes Louis Farrakhan blaming a complex societal issue on a single group by stating that Jews were “responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text describes how Tamika Mallory, when criticized, released statements condemning anti-Semitism in general but did not mention Mr. Farrakhan, a deliberately vague omission to avoid addressing the specific issue.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text explains that the Nation of Islam first became prominent after well-known figures like Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali joined, using their status and authority to attract followers.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text quotes Louis Farrakhan stating that “the ‘powerful Jews’ were his enemies,” which presents a simplistic “us vs. them” worldview, a form of the black & white fallacy.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text mentions the Nation of Islam’s use of the phrase “the white devil,” which serves to end critical thought about race relations by applying a simplistic and condemnatory label.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text reports that when pressed on the issue of Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism, Tamika Mallory wrote an essay focusing on how “the women of the Nation of Islam who supported me” in her past, introducing an emotional, personal story to distract from the request to condemn his remarks.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text notes that “Mr. Farrakhan has denied that he is anti-Semitic and has even said that his father may have been Jewish.” This attempts to refute the charge of anti-Semitism by bringing up his potential ancestry, an irrelevant point that misrepresents the actual basis of the accusation (his public statements).

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain any examples of an individual deflecting criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy on another issue.

Verdict – 5% – The text is a news article, not a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose, as stated in the headline, is to explain “Why Louis Farrakhan Is Back in the News.” The article’s own language is neutral and journalistic. It attributes all opinions, controversial statements, and labels to specific individuals or organizations (e.g., “Mr. Farrakhan said,” “the Anti-Defamation League wrote,” “Yvonne Chireau... called”). The text reports on and quotes many instances of propaganda used by Louis Farrakhan and others, but it does not employ these techniques itself to push an agenda. It presents multiple viewpoints, including those of Farrakhan’s critics, his defenders, and academic experts, to provide context for the reader. The very low 5% likelihood accounts for the inherent bias in selecting and framing any set of facts, but the article's structure and tone are overwhelmingly informative rather than persuasive.
