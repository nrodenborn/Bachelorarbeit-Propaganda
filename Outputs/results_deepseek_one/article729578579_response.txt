Below is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling – Yes** – Explanation: The text repeatedly uses derogatory labels for Pope Francis, such as "habitual liar," "confidence trickster," and "grifter." Example: "Bergoglio wanted Barros as a bishop and that was that."  
2. **Repetition – Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "no evidence" is repeated to emphasize the pope’s alleged dishonesty. Example: "‘No evidence’ is in fact a well-rehearsed, stock response for Bergoglio."  
3. **Slogans – No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases are used as rallying cries; the text relies on narrative arguments.  
4. **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Explanation: The text warns of societal and institutional collapse due to lost trust. Example: "This is the way societies disintegrate... how long before that predictable disintegration occurs?"  
5. **Doubt – Yes** – Explanation: The pope’s credibility is systematically questioned. Example: "It is now irrefutable that Pope Bergoglio is a habitual liar."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Explanation: The pope’s actions are exaggerated (e.g., "astoundingly brazen lie"), while his apologies are minimized. Example: "The pope had apologised-except-not-really."  
7. **Flag-Waving – No** – Explanation: No appeals to patriotism or group identity; the focus is on criticizing the pope, not rallying a specific group.  
8. **Loaded Language – Yes** – Explanation: Emotionally charged terms like "predatory homosexual," "homosexualist lobby," and "vicious temper tantrums" are used. Example: "Bergoglio’s legendary vicious temper tantrums."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis or Hitler; historical references (e.g., Vichy) are absent here.  
10. **Bandwagon – Yes** – Explanation: The text cites widespread criticism to validate its claims. Example: "This is what is now being said quite openly by a vast array of voices, secular and Catholic, left and right."  
11. **Causal Oversimplification – No** – Explanation: The abuse crisis is presented with multiple factors (e.g., institutional failure, papal decisions), not oversimplified.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – Explanation: The text is direct in its accusations; no deliberate ambiguity is used.  
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Explanation: Sources like Marie Collins and Cardinal O’Malley are cited to legitimize claims. Example: "Marie Collins... told AP, ‘Cardinal O’Malley called me... he had given the letter to the pope.’"  
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Explanation: Presents the pope’s actions as binary: either he lied or Cardinal O’Malley failed. Example: "There is really only one; that the pope lied."  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – Explanation: No clichés are used to shut down debate; the text invites scrutiny.  
16. **Red herring – No** – Explanation: All examples relate directly to the abuse scandal; no irrelevant distractions are introduced.  
17. **Straw men – No** – Explanation: The pope’s statements (e.g., "no evidence") are addressed directly, not misrepresented.  
18. **Whataboutism – No** – Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy targeting the pope’s critics; focus remains on his actions.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of persuasive techniques to delegitimize Pope Francis and advance a specific narrative. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language (e.g., "predatory homosexual," "confidence trickster") and appeals to fear (e.g., societal "disintegration") dominate the text, aiming to provoke outrage rather than encourage balanced analysis.  
- **Character Assassination**: Techniques like name-calling, repetition ("no evidence"), and exaggeration paint the pope as deceitful and morally compromised, ignoring counter-evidence or context.  
- **Selective Sourcing**: While citing authorities (e.g., abuse victims, cardinals), the text omits perspectives that might complicate its thesis (e.g., Vatican defenses or neutral analyses).  
- **Binary Framing**: The black-and-white fallacy reduces complex issues (e.g., abuse investigations) to simplistic moral absolutes ("the pope lied").  
- **Bandwagon Appeals**: References to "secular and Catholic" critics create an illusion of consensus, pressuring readers to align with the majority view.  

Though the text cites verifiable events (e.g., the Barros scandal, Ricca case), its one-sided framing, lack of nuance, and reliance on emotive rhetoric exceed objective reporting. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of factual elements, but the overwhelming use of propagandistic techniques indicates a clear intent to manipulate perception.
