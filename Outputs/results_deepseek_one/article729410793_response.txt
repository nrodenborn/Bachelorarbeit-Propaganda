### Verdict – 85% – Explanation:  
The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements by:  
1. **Advocating a specific doctrinal stance** (against same-sex blessings) while discrediting dissenting views (Marx’s position) using emotionally charged language (e.g., "sacrilegious," "sodomy").  
2. **Selective authority appeals** to the Catechism and conservative cardinals (Cordes, Chaput) while downplaying Marx’s authority as a papal advisor.  
3. **Framing dissent as dangerous** through fear appeals (e.g., "leads people away from God") and black-and-white fallacies (truth vs. confusion).  
4. **Obfuscating Marx’s position** with tangential disputes (translation corrections) and thought-terminating clichés.  
However, it retains journalistic structure (sourcing quotes, reporting corrections), preventing a 100% classification. The intent to persuade readers toward a rigid interpretation of doctrine aligns with propaganda, especially in a polarized religious context.
