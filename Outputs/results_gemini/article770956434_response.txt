1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the authorities who prosecuted the Hammonds and were involved in the death of LaVoy Finicum as “tyrants.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is repeated three times consecutively.

3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase “Justice is overdue for Dwight and Steven Hammond” is used as a brief, memorable phrase to encapsulate the author’s viewpoint.

4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to build support for its position by instilling fear about an alternative outcome.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the legitimacy of the Hammonds' conviction by stating, “The evidence at trial regarding the Hammonds’ responsibility for the fire was conflicting, and the jury acquitted them on most of the charges.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the arson for which the Hammonds were convicted by describing it as a fire that “leaked onto a small portion of neighboring public grazing land.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific American identity by describing the Hammonds as “multi-generation cattle ranchers” who have “widespread support from their neighbors, local law enforcement, and farmers and ranchers across the West.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the reader, such as “overzealous appeal,” “unjust,” “devoted family men,” and “tyrants.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to a specifically hated group like the Nazis to discredit them.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text encourages readers to support the Hammonds by stating they have “widespread support from their neighbors, local law enforcement, and farmers and ranchers across the West.”

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text claims the Oregon protests “were a response to the injustice the Hammonds faced,” reducing a complex event with multiple motivations to a single cause.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its bias and argument; it does not use intentionally vague or confusing language.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the original sentencing judge’s opinion that the mandatory minimum sentence would “shock the conscience” as evidence that the punishment was unjust.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a simple conflict between the “unjust” previous administration and the “right thing” done by President Trump, ignoring any legal nuance or alternative perspectives.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The rhetorical question, “…but that's not how tyrants work, is it?” is designed to shut down critical thought and encourage simple agreement with the author’s premise.

16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh is completely irrelevant to the article's topic of the Hammond pardon and serves as a distraction to engage the reader and gather data.

17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent an opponent's argument in order to attack it. It primarily presents its own one-sided narrative.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes the previous administration directly but does not use it as a way to deflect a charge of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. It employs a vast number of propaganda techniques (13 out of the 18 listed) to construct a one-sided narrative rather than provide a neutral report of events. The primary goal is not to inform but to influence the reader's opinion. This is achieved through the heavy use of emotionally loaded language ("unjust," "tyrants"), logical fallacies like causal oversimplification (the Oregon protests) and the black & white fallacy (previous administration vs. Trump), and appeals to emotion and identity (flag-waving for ranchers). The text carefully frames the Hammonds as sympathetic victims while minimizing their crime, and it uses an authority (the judge) selectively to bolster its argument. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Kavanaugh poll) further underscores that the article's purpose is persuasion and engagement, not objective journalism.
