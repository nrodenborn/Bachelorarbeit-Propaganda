Below is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the provided text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against subjects (e.g., "illegal immigrant" is factual, not derogatory).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No phrases or messages are repeated excessively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL!") appear.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – While discrimination concerns are mentioned ("fear they could face discrimination or violence"), it is attributed to the immigrants/advocates, not used to manipulate the audience.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility (e.g., no challenges to ICE/judge's legitimacy).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Language is neutral (e.g., "could face discrimination" is qualified, not hyperbolic).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – No – No emotionally charged words (e.g., "violated his rights" is a legal term, not inflammatory).

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Complex legal/immigration issues are acknowledged without oversimplifying causes.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are clear (e.g., specific events, dates, and legal reasoning).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – The judge’s ruling is cited for factual/legal context, not to overawe critics.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Multiple perspectives (ICE, judge, immigrants) are included; no false dichotomies.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases discourage critical thought (e.g., explanations invite reflection).  
16. **Red herring** – No – All content is relevant to the case (no irrelevant distractions).  
17. **Straw men** – No – Arguments (e.g., ICE’s position) are represented fairly.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no deflection to unrelated issues).  

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is a factual news report with minimal propagandistic elements. It neutrally presents multiple perspectives (judge's ruling, ICE’s rationale, immigrants' fears) without loaded language, emotional manipulation, or overt bias. The 5% uncertainty stems from the mention of religious identity ("Indonesian Christians," "Muslim-majority country"), which could subtly frame the narrative, but this is contextual rather than manipulative. Overall, it prioritizes objective reporting over persuasion.
