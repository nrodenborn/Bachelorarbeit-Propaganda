**Verdict – 75% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and straw men. These techniques are used to undermine Garry Wills' credibility and interpretation of the Qur'an, presenting a one-sided view that aligns with the author's perspective. While not every technique is present, the use of multiple propaganda strategies suggests a high likelihood that the text is intended to persuade the audience through biased and emotionally charged arguments.**
