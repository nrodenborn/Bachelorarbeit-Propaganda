Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and appeal to authority. These techniques suggest a high likelihood of the text being propaganda, as they aim to influence the audience's perception of the mayor's actions and the associated political implications. However, the absence of some techniques, such as repetition and bandwagon, indicates that not all possible propaganda methods are employed, leading to a slightly lower percentage.
