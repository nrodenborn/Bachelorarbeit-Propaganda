Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "left-wing enemedia", "Barack Hussein Obama’s jihad", "violent left-wing connections", "infamous Jew-hating event", "infamous antisemite Rashid Khalidi", "radical Reverend Jeremiah", "nefarious connections", "vicious jihad-supporting racist Louis Farrakhan", "terror group, the Nation of Islam". These are insulting labels applied to media, Obama, Khalidi, Wright, Obama's connections, Farrakhan, and the Nation of Islam.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: While certain themes (like hidden connections) are consistent, the text does not significantly repeat the *exact same phrase or message* over and over.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not employ a brief, memorable phrase designed for easy recall and repetition (like "Build the Wall" or "Make America Great Again").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text repeatedly implies Obama's hidden, dangerous associations (jihad, antisemitism, radicalism) were covered up to deceive the public and gain power. The quotes from Farrakhan ("wipe this nation from the face of the Earth", "rain destruction upon white America") are used to instill fear about the nature of these associations and the consequences if known. The core claim is that revealing the photo would have changed the election, implying voters were tricked into electing someone with dangerous ties.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text explicitly questions the credibility of Obama ("Barack Hussein Obama’s jihad and violent left-wing connections"), the mainstream media ("ignored by the mainstream media", "worked as furiously to cover up"), and the legitimacy of his election ("It absolutely would have made a difference").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggeration: Labeling mainstream media as "left-wing enemedia", describing Obama's connections as "jihad" and "violent left-wing connections", calling the Nation of Islam a "terror group", characterizing the photo suppression as a decade-long "conspiracy". Minimization: Presenting the media's coverage choices regarding Wright and the photo as a malicious cover-up rather than editorial decisions or lack of newsworthiness at the time.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity as a reason to support its claims. Its focus is on attacking Obama and the media.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text heavily uses emotionally charged and prejudicial language: "enemedia", "jihad", "violent", "infamous Jew-hating", "infamous antisemite", "radical", "God damn America", "nefarious", "vicious jihad-supporting racist", "terror group", "conspired", "kept it hidden". These words evoke strong negative emotions (fear, anger, disgust) and rely on stereotypes (linking Islam/Muslims to terrorism/violence).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text includes multiple quotes from Farrakhan praising Hitler ("Hitler was a very great man") and referencing the Holocaust ("don’t nobody ever ask what did they do to Hitler"). By associating Obama (via the photo) with Farrakhan, who holds these views, the text implicitly links Obama (or at least his supporters' actions) to Hitler apologia and antisemitism, knowing these are universally reviled positions.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not argue that its claims are true or should be believed because they are popular or widely accepted. It focuses on alleged concealment and the nature of the connections.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text doesn't present a single, simple cause for a complex event (like an election outcome). While it strongly implies the hidden photo *would* have changed the election, it doesn't reduce the entire event to that single cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is quite direct and specific in its accusations and claims (e.g., naming individuals, groups, the photo, the alleged conspiracy). It does not rely on deliberately unclear or obscure language to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: While the author (Pamela Geller) cites her own book and uses quotes from Muhammad and Farrakhan, there is no significant appeal to an *external authority figure* (like an expert, leader, or institution) whose endorsement is used as primary evidence for the core claims. Muhammad's quotes are about his actions/opinions regarding the photo, not an authoritative validation of the text's broader accusations.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: The text doesn't explicitly frame the situation as only having two possible choices or outcomes. Its focus is on alleged wrongdoing and concealment.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not use simplistic, conventional phrases designed to shut down critical thought (e.g., "It is what it is", "America: love it or leave it").
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on its core narrative: Obama's controversial associations, the media's alleged cover-up, and the suppression of the Farrakhan photo. It does not introduce significantly irrelevant material to distract from this central theme.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text attacks positions or actions it attributes to the media and Obama supporters (covering up connections, conspiring to hide the photo). While these characterizations may be exaggerated or contested, the text does not primarily focus on refuting a specific, clearly stated opposing argument by misrepresenting it.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not charge its opponents (Obama, the media) with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated actions or inconsistencies in their own behavior. Its criticism is directly focused on their actions regarding Obama's associations and the photo.

**Verdict – 95% – Explanation:** The text exhibits a high concentration of recognized propaganda techniques, particularly Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Loaded Language, and Reduction ad Hitlerum. Its primary purpose is not to neutrally inform but to aggressively discredit Barack Obama, his associates (Farrakhan, Khalidi, Wright), and the mainstream media ("enemedia") by associating them with extremism (jihad, antisemitism, racism, terrorism) and alleging a deliberate conspiracy to hide damaging information. The language is overwhelmingly inflammatory and emotionally manipulative, relying on stereotypes and fear. The selective presentation of Farrakhan's most extreme quotes alongside the photo claim is designed to create maximum outrage and imply guilt by association. While it reports Muhammad's claim about suppressing the photo, this fact is embedded within and used to bolster a much broader, highly biased narrative of deception and dangerous hidden allegiances, making the overall text function as propaganda. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the factual basis of Muhammad's statement about holding the photo, though its interpretation and framing within the text are propagandistic.
