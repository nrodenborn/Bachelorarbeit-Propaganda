1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack its subjects, such as calling the media the "leftist media," describing Louis Farrakhan as a "raging anti-Semite and race-monger," and his organization as "loony, militant."
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat the same specific phrase or message over and over again in the style of a rhetorical device.
3. Slogans – No – The text reports on slogans used by others but does not employ its own brief, memorable phrases to rally support.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text attempts to instill fear by describing Farrakhan as "dangerous," leading a "militant, black nationalist organization" with a "large following," implying a significant threat that is being ignored.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively seeks to cast doubt on the credibility and motives of the news media, stating they "somehow the openly racist and anti-Semitic Farrakhan and his hateful organization have managed for decades to avoid being harshly denounced as such by the news media."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by stating the media is "entirely focused on the push to ban AR-15s" and that "practically no one noticed" Farrakhan's speech, which are unlikely to be literally true.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity to make its point.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words intended to influence the audience, such as "raging," "loony," "militant," "inferior white devil," "hateful," and "smear."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text explicitly uses this technique to criticize the media, stating it "has spent the last two years attempting to smear Donald Trump as the new Hitler."
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular; in fact, it argues the opposite, suggesting it is highlighting something unpopular or ignored.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple cause for a complex issue, implying that the sole reason Farrakhan is not more widely condemned is the bias of the "leftist media," ignoring other potential factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague or intentionally unclear; its points and accusations are direct and explicit.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites authorities to support its claims, such as referencing "The Washington Examiner," quoting CNN anchor "Jake Tapper," and directing readers to the "Horowitz Freedom Center's resource site."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy where the media is either focused on "AR-15s" and Trump (the wrong thing) or focused on Farrakhan (the right thing), ignoring the possibility of covering multiple topics.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down debate; it uses argumentative and provocative language to persuade.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the topics of the "push to ban AR-15s," the "Second Amendment," and the media's treatment of "Donald Trump" to distract from the core issue of Farrakhan's speech and pivot to an attack on the media.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text creates a straw man by claiming the "leftist media" is "entirely focused" on other issues and has failed to denounce Farrakhan, an exaggeration that is easier to attack than the more nuanced reality of media coverage (which it even partially acknowledges by quoting Jake Tapper).
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text is a clear example of whataboutism. Its central argument deflects from other issues (like criticism of Trump or gun control debates) by saying, "But what about Louis Farrakhan? Why aren't you talking about him?" thereby accusing the media of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to neutrally inform the reader about Louis Farrakhan's speech, but to use the speech as a tool to advance a specific political agenda. This agenda involves discrediting entities it labels the "leftist media," defending Donald Trump, and attacking political figures like Barack Obama.

The piece systematically employs a wide array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. It relies heavily on **Name Calling** ("loony," "leftist media") and **Loaded Language** ("raging," "hateful," "smear") to provoke an emotional reaction rather than a rational one. The entire structure is built on the logical fallacies of **Whataboutism** and **Red Herring**, deflecting from any other political discussion to focus on the perceived hypocrisy of its opponents. It creates a **Straw Man** of the media by exaggerating their focus and alleged silence, and then attacks this caricature. It further simplifies a complex media landscape into a **Black & White Fallacy** of good versus evil.

The text does not seek to foster understanding but to incite anger and distrust against its designated enemies. The combination of emotional manipulation, logical fallacies, and a clear partisan goal, culminating in a promotion for a partisan "resource site," firmly places it in the category of propaganda.
