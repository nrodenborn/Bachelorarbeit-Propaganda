**Verdict – 30% – The text shows some characteristics of propaganda, particularly through the use of doubt and intentional vagueness. The questioning of the Obama Administration's credibility and the vague reference to "mysterious memos" suggest an attempt to cast doubt and create confusion. However, the text primarily presents statistical data and analysis, which reduces the likelihood of it being propaganda. The presence of only a couple of propaganda techniques indicates a moderate but not overwhelming likelihood of the text being propaganda.**
