1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels such as “left-wing enemedia,” “infamous Jew-hating event,” “infamous antisemite,” and “vicious jihad-supporting racist Louis Farrakhan.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The story of the photographer hiding the photo is repeated multiple times, first in the author’s summary and then in excerpts from other news sources. The Farrakhan quote, “The Jews don’t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that’s a good name. Hitler was a very great man,” is also listed twice.
3. Slogans – Yes – The title of the author’s book, “The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration’s War on America,” is used as a brief, memorable phrase to encapsulate a specific viewpoint.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text links Barack Obama to figures and groups associated with violence and extremism, such as “jihad,” the “terror group, the Nation of Islam,” and Louis Farrakhan, whose threatening quotes are listed to instill fear and alarm.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built on questioning the narrative around Barack Obama and the integrity of the media, stating, “The left-wing enemedia worked as furiously to cover up, censor and sanction Barack Hussein Obama’s jihad and violent left-wing connections...”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by labeling Obama’s associations as a “jihad” and minimizes the extensive media coverage of the Reverend Wright controversy by calling it “scant coverage.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the subject as a “War on America” and by using quotes like “God damn America” to portray figures as being anti-American.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like “enemedia,” “jihad,” “vicious,” “nefarious,” and “terror group” to evoke strong negative feelings.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text directly links Obama to Farrakhan, and then quotes Farrakhan as saying, “The Jews don’t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that’s a good name. Hitler was a very great man,” thereby associating Obama with someone who praises Hitler.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest its ideas are popular; instead, it presents itself as a contrarian view that was “ignored by the mainstream media.”
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests that a major factor in Obama’s political success was a simple conspiracy to hide one photograph, as stated: “he conspired with the terror group, the Nation of Islam, to keep it hidden for 10 years.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; its accusations are direct and its language, while loaded, is not intentionally obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the author’s own book as an authoritative source (“I detailed Obama’s nefarious connections and resulting worldview in my book...”) and quotes other media outlets like the Trice Edney News Wire and Talking Point Memo to support its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a world where the media either works to “cover up” for Obama or to “manufacture and make up lies to destroy President Trump,” presenting only two extreme options for the media’s role.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The term “left-wing enemedia” is used as a thought-terminating cliché to dismiss any information from mainstream sources without critical analysis.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the topic of President Trump (“as they do to manufacture and make up lies to destroy President Trump”), which is irrelevant to the core story about a 2005 photograph of Barack Obama, to distract and reframe the issue.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text implies that the mainstream media completely ignored Obama’s controversial connections (“The media gave scant coverage to Obama’s close relationship with radical Reverend Jeremiah... Wright”), refuting an exaggerated version of the media’s actual position, as the Wright controversy was in fact a major news story.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – When criticizing the media’s alleged cover-up for Obama, the text immediately pivots to charge them with hypocrisy regarding another figure: “...as they do to manufacture and make up lies to destroy President Trump.”

Verdict – 100% – The text is an unambiguous example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint by employing a dense and overwhelming number of propaganda techniques. The piece systematically uses name-calling, loaded language, and appeals to fear to create a strong emotional reaction of anger and distrust. It constructs a narrative of conspiracy through causal oversimplification (the hidden photo explains everything) and a black & white fallacy (the media is either with Obama or Trump). It attempts to discredit all opposing information by labeling sources as "enemedia" (a thought-terminating cliché) and introducing red herrings and whataboutism related to President Trump to distract and polarize the reader. The sheer volume and combination of these techniques, from emotional manipulation to logical fallacies, confirm that the text's intent is to indoctrinate rather than to engage in factual, nuanced reporting.
