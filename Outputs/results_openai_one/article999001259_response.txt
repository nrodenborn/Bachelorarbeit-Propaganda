**Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, and loaded language. These elements suggest an attempt to influence the reader's perception of the election and judicial ruling. However, not all techniques are present, and the text also contains factual information about the court ruling and election process, which reduces the overall likelihood of it being pure propaganda.**
