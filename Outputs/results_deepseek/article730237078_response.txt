### Verdict – 15% –   
The text primarily **reports factual achievements** of NASA’s New Horizons mission, using celebratory language common in science communication. While it employs *loaded language* (e.g., "remarkable," "crazy"), *mild exaggeration*, *appeals to authority* (quoting a scientist), and *subtle flag-waving* (emphasizing human history records), these techniques serve to highlight genuine milestones rather than manipulate or deceive. The absence of fear-mongering, false dichotomies, or misleading distractions places it far from propaganda. However, the tone leans toward promotional enthusiasm (≈15% propaganda likelihood), reflecting NASA’s institutional interest in public engagement, not ideological coercion.
