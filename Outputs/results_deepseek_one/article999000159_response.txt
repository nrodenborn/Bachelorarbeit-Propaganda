---

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It uses multiple persuasive techniques to advance a specific agenda (gun rights advocacy), including **Appeal to Fear** (threat of Democrat-led gun control), **Flag-Waving** (patriotic appeal to the Second Amendment), **Loaded Language** ("hopping-mad," "ace up our sleeve"), and **Bandwagon** (implying gun owners are a motivated majority). The **Red Herring** (migrant caravan poll) and **Name-Calling** ("anti-gun Left") further distract and polarize. While it provides factual elements (e.g., Pelosi’s policy priority), the framing is one-sided, emotionally charged, and designed to provoke urgency around voting. The call to action ("get to the polls") and selective use of data (GOA’s "study") align with propaganda’s goal of influencing behavior through biased persuasion.
