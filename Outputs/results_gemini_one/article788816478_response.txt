1. Name calling – Yes – The text directly attacks Christine Blasey Ford and her lawyer by quoting former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova, who says Ford will "look like the loon she is" and that her lawyer is "even loonier." It also labels her "obviously unbalanced" and her lawyers as "social justice warrior-lawyers."

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly pushes the idea that the Democrats and Christine Blasey Ford are deliberately delaying the confirmation process for political gain. Examples include: "delaying a confirmation vote," "deliberately refused to bring up the allegations," "drag the confirmation process out as long as possible," and "Ford’s request for an FBI probe is ‘clearly a desire to delay proceedings’".

3. Slogans – No – The text does not employ any brief, memorable phrases in a slogan-like manner to rally support.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear about the consequences of a delayed confirmation, stating, "If Kavanaugh isn’t in place a week from Monday, the Supreme Court will begin hearing cases in its new term shorthanded." It also stokes fear of political opponents by suggesting Democrats "hope to take control from Republicans."

5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built on casting doubt on the accuser and her motives. It calls her accusations "never-credible" and "weak and ridiculous," and questions her desire to testify by quoting someone who says, "Ford ‘really doesn’t want to testify’".

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the Democrats' actions by saying they wanted to "hurl the wild claims like a grenade at the last minute to blow up the process." It also minimizes the allegation by referring to it as "drunken groping," a less severe description than the "possible attempted rape" mentioned earlier.

7. Flag-Waving – No – While the subject matter is national politics, the text does not use appeals to patriotism or national identity to make its case. The framing is partisan, not patriotic.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to create a bias. Examples include "malicious agenda," "wild claims," "game the system," "social justice warrior-lawyers," and "torpedo President Trump’s agenda."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text makes no comparisons to Nazis or other universally hated groups.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. Its appeal is based on discrediting the opposition, not on claiming majority support.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text explains the complex political battle over the confirmation as being caused by a single, simple factor: "The Left’s continuing success in delaying a confirmation vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court reveals its malicious agenda to block the nominee".

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; its purpose and accusations are very direct and clear, even if they are biased.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses a quote from "former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova" to lend credibility to its attacks on Ford, presenting his opinion as expert analysis. It also quotes President Trump to portray the administration's position as reasonable.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice between the rational, honest nominee and his supporters versus the "malicious," "loony," and manipulative opposition. It frames the request for an investigation as either a genuine desire to testify (which it dismisses) or a political ploy, ignoring any other nuances.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases to shut down discussion, such as calling the demand for an FBI probe "utter nonsense" and stating the FBI can't investigate "because there is nothing to investigate," presenting these as final judgments rather than points for debate.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the topic of threats against Kavanaugh's wife. While a serious issue, it is irrelevant to the truth of Ford's allegations and serves to distract the reader and generate sympathy for Kavanaugh's side.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text reframes the request for an FBI investigation as being purely a delay tactic ("clearly a desire to delay proceedings"). It then attacks this constructed motive, rather than addressing the stated reason for the request, which was to conduct a "full investigation prior to her testimony.”

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy by pointing to their own past actions using a "what about..." structure. Its attacks are focused on the opponents' current actions and character.

***

**Verdict – 95% –** This text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. It does not attempt to provide a balanced or objective account of the events surrounding the Kavanaugh confirmation. Instead, its primary purpose is to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint by systematically discrediting the opposition.

The piece relies heavily on a wide array of propaganda techniques. The most prominent are **Name Calling** (labeling the accuser a "loon" and "unbalanced"), **Loaded Language** ("malicious agenda," "blow up the process"), and **Doubt** ("never-credible accusations"). These are used to create a strong emotional bias against Christine Blasey Ford and the Democratic party.

Furthermore, the text employs **Causal Oversimplification** by reducing a complex political event to a simple, sinister plot by "The Left." It uses **Appeal to Authority** by quoting a former U.S. Attorney to give its attacks a veneer of credibility and constructs a **Straw Man** by misrepresenting the call for an FBI investigation as merely a delay tactic. The entire narrative is framed as a **Black & White Fallacy**, pitting a reasonable and wronged nominee against a manipulative and irrational opposition. The sheer number and blatant use of these techniques confirm that the text is not a piece of journalism but a work of persuasion designed to manipulate the reader's opinion.
