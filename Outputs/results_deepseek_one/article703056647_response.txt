Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling – No** – No insulting labels are applied to the subject (the plague outbreak or Madagascar).
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The idea of the epidemic potentially "exploding" is repeated: "...epidemic could explode...", "...see the number of those infected explode...".
3.  **Slogans – No** – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans are present.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – The text repeatedly emphasizes the deadliness ("Black Death", "deadlier pneumonic strain", "killed"), ease of spread ("spread easily through a cough or sneeze"), potential for global pandemic ("unleashing the sickness on the globe", "spread the disease globally"), and specific threats to tourist destinations ("British honeymoon paradises like Mauritius, the Maldives or the Seychelles") to instill fear about the outbreak. Example: "It would take just one infected traveler who made it to Africa’s mainland or even nearby British honeymoon paradises like Mauritius, the Maldives or the Seychelles to spread the disease globally."
5.  **Doubt – No** – The text does not question the credibility of any specific person or institution; it presents warnings from officials and experts.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – The use of the historically loaded term "Black Death" (commonly associated with the medieval pandemic killing tens of millions) to describe a modern outbreak (128 deaths reported) and the dramatic language "taking Madagascar to its knees", "explode", "deadlier", "unleashing the sickness on the globe" leans towards exaggeration. Example: Headline "Officials Warn: Airborne Black Death Epidemic Could ‘Explode’".
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – There is no appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – The text uses highly evocative and emotionally charged language: "Black Death", "taking Madagascar to its knees", "explode", "unleashing the sickness on the globe", "deadlier pneumonic strain", "medieval disease", "dancing with the dead", "fueled by". Example: "The bubonic plague outbreak that is taking Madagascar to its knees will more than likely last another six months."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparison is made to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or action.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – The text strongly implies the Famadihana ritual is a primary driver ("fueled by") of the outbreak, potentially oversimplifying the complex factors (poverty, healthcare access, sanitation, vector control, climate) involved in plague transmission. Example: "The outbreak has been fueled by performing the ancient practice of Famadihana."
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is generally clear and specific about the disease, its transmission, the risks, and the cited practices/seasonal factors.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – The text cites warnings from "Officials", "The Foreign Office", "experts", "the country’s health chief Willy Randriamarotia", and "Olivier Le Guillou of Action Against Hunger" to support its claims. Example: "The Foreign Office recently warned that the deadly outbreak is entering its most dangerous phase." and "The country’s health chief Willy Randriamarotia said..."
14. **Black & white fallacy – No** – The text does not present a situation with only two extreme options.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – No** – No phrases are used to shut down critical thought.
16. **Red herring – No** – The discussion of Famadihana is directly related to the outbreak topic as presented (as a potential transmission risk), not an irrelevant distraction.
17. **Straw men – No** – No misrepresented arguments are refuted.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – No accusations of hypocrisy are made.

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits several hallmarks of propaganda, primarily through its heavy use of **Appeal to Fear** and **Loaded Language** ("Black Death," "explode," "unleashing," "taking to its knees," "deadlier," "medieval," "dancing with the dead"). This sensationalist language is designed to evoke a strong emotional response (panic, dread) rather than solely inform. There is also **Exaggeration** in the historical comparison and dramatic framing of the risk, and **Causal Oversimplification** by prominently blaming the Famadihana ritual as "fueling" the outbreak, potentially diverting attention from systemic issues. While it cites **Appeal to Authority** (officials, health chief, aid worker) and contains factual elements (case numbers, transmission method, rainy season timing, quarantine measures), the overall presentation prioritizes alarming imagery and emotional impact over balanced, nuanced reporting. The framing serves more to scare and potentially stigmatize cultural practices than to provide a calm assessment of the public health situation and response. However, the presence of cited sources and specific details prevents it from being rated as definitively pure propaganda (100%).
