1. Name calling – No – The text criticizes the Democratic Party for hypocrisy but does not use insulting labels or slurs to attack them.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question ‘Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?’ is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear in the audience about alternatives. It focuses on generating anger and distrust.
5. Doubt – Yes – The article is constructed to cast doubt on the sincerity and credibility of the Democratic Party. The line, “Democrats, they do pick their “victims” well, don’t they?” directly questions their motives.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text frames the Democratic Party's response as insufficient but does not use clear exaggeration or minimization of facts to do so.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The article does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The phrase “pick their ‘victims’ well” is emotionally loaded. The use of quotation marks around "victims" suggests they are not genuine but are selected for political purposes, appealing to a negative stereotype of politicians.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to hated groups like the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is good because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The article implies that the sole reason for the different responses to the Monahan and Ford accusations is political hypocrisy. This simplifies a complex situation by ignoring other potential factors like the nature of the evidence, the timing, and the specific political races involved.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article’s point is direct and clear, not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – No – While it cites Fox News and Karen Monahan, they are presented as sources of information and personal testimony, not as infallible authorities whose support alone proves the article's argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The article frames the situation as a binary choice: either Democrats believe all women (including Monahan) and act on it, or they are cynical hypocrites. It ignores any nuanced positions or alternative reasons for the differing reactions to the two cases.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The rhetorical question, “Democrats, they do pick their “victims” well, don’t they?” is not meant to be analyzed but to be accepted as an obvious truth, discouraging a deeper examination of the party's motives.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about Nikki Haley's replacement is completely irrelevant to the article's topic of Keith Ellison and Brett Kavanaugh. It serves as a distraction and a data-collection tool.
17. Straw men – Yes – The article sets up a straw man of the Democratic position as an absolute, unconditional belief in all accusers ("believe women"). It then attacks this simplified position by showing an instance where the party appears not to adhere to it, rather than engaging with a more nuanced, likely position (e.g., "all accusations should be taken seriously").
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The entire premise of the article is a form of whataboutism. It deflects from the accusations against the Republican-nominated Kavanaugh by pointing to the Democratic Party's handling of accusations against one of their own, charging them with hypocrisy: "You're upset about Kavanaugh, but what about Ellison?"

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of the Democratic Party by portraying it as hypocritical. The article is built on a foundation of propaganda techniques, most notably **Whataboutism**, which forms the core of its argument by contrasting the Kavanaugh and Ellison cases. It employs a **Straw Man** by misrepresenting the "believe women" movement as an absolute, unconditional stance that is easily attacked. It uses a **Black & White Fallacy** to present the only options as total belief in all accusers or cynical hypocrisy, ignoring any middle ground or nuance. The author uses **Loaded Language** (“pick their ‘victims’ well”) and rhetorical questions that function as **Thought-terminating Clichés** to guide the reader's emotional response and shut down critical thought. Furthermore, the inclusion of a completely irrelevant **Red Herring** poll and the **Repetition** within it are characteristic of persuasive, partisan content rather than objective journalism. While the events it describes are real, the framing, selection, and juxtaposition of facts are manipulated to serve a singular, persuasive goal.
