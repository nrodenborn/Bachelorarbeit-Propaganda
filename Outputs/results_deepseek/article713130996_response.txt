### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "seven-time felon", "repeatedly deported Mexican national", "career criminal", "Bay Area radicals", "Stalinists".  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated use of "show trial" (4 times), "sanctuary city/state" (3 times), "career criminal" (2 times).

14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents left as pro-criminal ("criminals are victims") vs. justice-seeking observers.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Politically correct jury", "show trial" used to dismiss due process.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Gonzalez’s education ("affirmative action"), graffiti art, and awards distract from legal arguments.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic, employing **15/18 techniques** analyzed. Its core purpose is to advance a political narrative by:  
1. **Dehumanizing targets**: Labels (e.g., "felon," "illegals") strip individuals of complexity.  
2. **Exploiting emotion**: Loaded language ("gunned down," "travesty") and fear appeals override factual analysis.  
3. **Distorting reality**: False equivalences (Stalin/Gonzalez), causal oversimplification (sanctuary policy → murder), and exaggeration ("show trial") manipulate perception.  
4. **Ideological framing**: Quotes from Koestler/Orwell/Brecht universalize "the left" as truth-averse, while sealed juror identities imply conspiracy.  
5. **Suppressing nuance**: Dismisses legal arguments (e.g., "momentary possession") via thought-terminating clichés ("politically correct jury").  
  
The 5% uncertainty acknowledges minimal factual reporting (e.g., Zarate’s acquittal), but these facts are weaponized to serve the polemic. The text’s relentless technique usage, lack of balanced evidence, and overt agenda fulfill propaganda’s defining function: **to persuade through manipulation rather than reason**.
