Name calling – No – The text uses factual descriptors like "suspect" and "convicted felon" based on the context of the events and public records, not insulting labels intended to attack.

Repetition – No – The text repeats the names of the officers and the fact they were killed, which is a standard practice in news reporting for clarity and to identify the subjects of the story, not to push a propagandistic message.

Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases designed to persuade or create a powerful emotional response.

Appeal to fear – No – The text describes a frightening event but does not use that fear to promote a specific idea or argue against an alternative. It is reporting on the facts of the incident.

Doubt – No – The text reports on what is known and unknown (e.g., "It's unclear at what point Smith was shot"), which is a feature of objective journalism, not an attempt to question the credibility of a person or source.

Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text reports the events using factual language (e.g., "fatally shot," "critical condition") without sensationalizing or downplaying the severity of the situation.

Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions the location (Westerville, Ohio) for informational context, not to appeal to patriotism or local identity.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to hated groups to discredit an idea.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that any idea is correct or should be adopted because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does the opposite; it provides a complex background of prior domestic dispute calls and the suspect's history, avoiding a simplistic explanation for the event.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is written clearly. When information is unavailable, it states so directly rather than using vague language to confuse the reader.

Appeal to authority – No – The text cites official sources like the police chief and incident reports, which is standard journalistic practice for sourcing information, not a logical fallacy used to prove a point.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text reports on an event and does not present an argument with only two possible options.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any clichés or phrases intended to shut down critical thought.

Red herring – No – All the information provided, such as the history of domestic disputes, is relevant to the context of the main event and not included to distract the reader.

Straw men – No – The text is a news report and does not construct or refute any arguments.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge anyone with hypocrisy or deflect from the topic by pointing out the faults of others.
