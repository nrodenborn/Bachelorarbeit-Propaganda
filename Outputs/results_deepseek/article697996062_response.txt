Here is the analysis of the text according to the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "illegal aliens" (used repeatedly), "less glamorous illegal aliens". These are insulting labels applied to the subjects.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – "illegal aliens" is repeated numerous times throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No distinct, brief, memorable phrase used as a slogan is present.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "If you legalize them, you move closer to legalizing all illegals." This instills fear about the consequences of legalizing DREAMERs.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text asserts its points strongly; it doesn't primarily aim to raise doubt about the credibility of a specific opposing entity.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "They're an industry: an economic industry and a political industry." This exaggerates the nature and role of undocumented immigrants, framing them as a coordinated economic and political force.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or national identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "illegal aliens", "Obama's illegal amnesty", "less glamorous illegal aliens", "violating the law", "snared". These terms carry strong negative connotations and appeal to emotion/stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Hitler or universally hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to the popularity of an idea is made.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – "If you legalize them, you move closer to legalizing all illegals." This presents legalization as a simple slippery slope without acknowledging the complexity of immigration policy and legal distinctions.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – "The distinction... has always been a matter of rhetoric, not substance." This dismisses a complex legal/political distinction (DACA recipients vs. other undocumented immigrants) as meaningless without explanation, obscuring the actual differences. "In more ways than one." is vague regarding how DREAMERs are violating the law beyond the cited smuggling.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is cited for the specific events, the core arguments (about DREAMERs, amnesty, illegals being an "industry") are not primarily supported by referencing an authority figure.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text doesn't explicitly present only two choices as the sole options (though the implication of the "slippery slope" leans towards a binary outcome).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "rhetoric, not substance", "They're an industry". These phrases shut down deeper analysis of the distinction between DACA recipients and other undocumented immigrants and the complex reasons for migration.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text focuses primarily on DREAMERs and illegal immigration; it doesn't introduce a significantly irrelevant topic to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text doesn't explicitly refute an argument that wasn't presented. It states its own position and reports events.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text doesn't charge opponents with hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. While it reports factual events (two DACA recipients arrested for smuggling), this reporting is embedded within and used to support a highly biased narrative. Key indicators include:
*   The pervasive use of **Loaded Language** ("illegal aliens", "illegal amnesty") and **Name Calling** to dehumanize the subjects and frame the issue negatively from the start.
*   **Repetition** of the term "illegal aliens" reinforces this negative framing.
*   **Exaggeration/Minimization** by portraying undocumented immigrants collectively as an "industry" minimizes their humanity and exaggerates their role as an organized force.
*   **Causal Oversimplification** through the "slippery slope" argument regarding legalization, ignoring policy complexities.
*   **Obfuscation** by dismissing the distinction between DACA recipients and other undocumented immigrants as merely "rhetoric, not substance" without substantive argument.
*   **Appeal to Fear** regarding the consequences of legalizing DACA recipients.
*   **Thought-terminating clichés** ("rhetoric, not substance", "industry") that prevent critical examination of the issues.
The primary purpose of the text is not balanced reporting but to promote a specific, negative viewpoint on DACA recipients and undocumented immigration using emotionally charged language, oversimplification, and selective framing of facts. The factual core is minimal compared to the dominant propagandistic elements.
