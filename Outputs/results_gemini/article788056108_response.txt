Here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses insulting labels to attack Pope Francis (Bergoglio), such as “monster,” “power-mad ecclesiastical tyrant,” “The Dictator Pope,” “wolf,” and “papal malefactor.”

2.  Repetition – Yes – The central idea that Pope Francis is a tyrant, a threat, and must be removed is stated repeatedly throughout the text in various forms. For example, the text calls him a “power-mad ecclesiastical tyrant” and concludes with the definitive statement, “No, Bergoglio must go.”

3.  Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate its message, such as “The Dictator Pope” and the concluding call to action, “No, Bergoglio must go.”

4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by portraying Pope Francis’s pontificate as a “grave threat to the common good of the Church and the integrity of the Faith,” suggesting it is “wreaking havoc upon faith and morals to the detriment of countless souls” and leading to the “worst crisis in her history.”

5.  Doubt – Yes – The entire text is structured to cast doubt on the credibility and legitimacy of Pope Francis, from his response to accusations (“cunning response”) to the validity of his election and his fitness for office (“By what possible stretch of the imagination would such an occupant be suited for the Chair of Peter?”).

6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the situation, calling it “the worst crisis in her history” and describing the Pope’s actions as an “insane drive to shatter the Church’s bimillennial discipline.” It also minimizes the position of those who disagree, dismissing opposition to Francis on traditional grounds as “just ‘ideology’.”

7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a shared Catholic identity by framing its argument as a defense of the Church itself, its traditions, and the “integrity of the Faith” against an internal attacker, urging action for a “rescue of the Church.”

8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged and stereotypical language, such as “cunning response,” “damning indictment,” “preening,” “power-mad,” “plague of Bergoglio,” and “criminally abused,” designed to evoke strong negative emotions in the reader.

9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an idea by associating it with a group hated by the target audience.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests a growing movement against Pope Francis by highlighting that “The scales have fallen from Fisher’s eyes” and noting that “At last count, some 29 bishops have publicly declared Viganò’s allegations against Bergoglio credible.”

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents the complex crisis in the Catholic Church as being caused by a single individual (“the plague of Bergoglio”) and proposes a simple solution: his removal (“No, Bergoglio must go”).

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and explicit in its accusations and its desired outcome. It does not use vague or obscure language to confuse the audience.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites numerous authorities to support its claims, including Archbishop Viganò, canonist Edward Peters, Cardinal Eijk, the theologian Cajetan, and even Pope Benedict XVI.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark choice: either act to remove Pope Francis to save the Church, or allow him to continue his “rampage.” It dismisses any middle ground or possibility of reform, stating “the Church cannot abide this pontificate any longer.”

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – While the text is a long-form argument, its conclusion, “No, Bergoglio must go,” is presented as a definitive, non-negotiable endpoint intended to shut down further debate and demand action.

16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central argument of deposing Pope Francis. The lengthy historical examples are not distractions but are used as precedents to justify the proposed course of action.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes arguments that are not necessarily being made, such as attacking the oversimplified idea that “every Pope is chosen by the Holy Ghost” as a “pious fable.” It also misrepresents Simcha Fisher’s position by stating “Fisher knows that Francis knows it,” directly contradicting her stated attempt not to assume the worst.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism of its own side by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy. It is consistently on the attack against its target, Pope Francis.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is an overwhelming example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or present a balanced perspective, but to persuade the reader to adopt an extreme position and support a radical course of action. This is achieved through the heavy and coordinated use of a vast majority (14 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques.

The piece is built on a foundation of highly emotional and aggressive rhetoric, employing constant **Name Calling** (“monster,” “tyrant,” “wolf”) and **Loaded Language** to demonize its subject. It creates a sense of imminent doom through a strong **Appeal to Fear**, portraying the Pope as a threat to the very existence of the Church and the salvation of souls.

To legitimize its radical call for deposition, the text uses the **Bandwagon** technique by listing a growing number of bishops and experts who are supposedly coming to the same conclusion, and it leans heavily on **Appeal to Authority** by citing canonists, cardinals, and historical precedents. The argument is framed using a **Black & White Fallacy**, presenting the removal of the Pope as the only possible solution to a crisis that is itself explained through **Causal Oversimplification** (i.e., one man is the sole cause of all problems). The relentless repetition of this core message, culminating in the slogan-like, **Thought-terminating** phrase “No, Bergoglio must go,” leaves no room for critical thought or alternative solutions. The combination of these techniques creates a powerful, one-sided polemic designed to incite outrage and action rather than foster understanding.
