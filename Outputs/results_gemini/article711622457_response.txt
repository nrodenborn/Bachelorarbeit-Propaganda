1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels individuals it opposes as “jihad preachers” and their ideology as “Sharia supremacism,” which are insulting labels intended to discredit them.

2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that the UK government is ignoring the “real problem” of “jihad terror” is repeated throughout the text. The phrase “jihad terror” itself is used multiple times, and Donald Trump’s tweet is included twice.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the brief, memorable phrase “shoot the messenger” to frame the UK’s reaction to Trump and the author.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by citing “jihad atrocities,” “destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism,” and quoting a preacher who advocates for beheading, burning, and throwing homosexuals from cliffs. This is used to suggest a dire alternative to the author's viewpoint.

5. Doubt – Yes – The author questions the credibility of the label applied to him and Pamela Geller by asking rhetorically, “Why are we ‘far right’?... That’s ‘far right’?” This is intended to make the reader doubt the validity of the classification.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the controversy over Trump’s retweets by framing it simply as an effort to “call attention to jihad atrocities,” while exaggerating the threat by focusing on the most extreme examples of preachers being admitted to the UK.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The author appeals to patriotism and national identity by framing his work as being in “defense of Britain and its values against jihad terror.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged language designed to influence the reader, such as “brouhaha,” “jihad atrocities,” “destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism,” and “Sharia supremacism.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – While the word “fascism” is used, it is used by the author’s opponent (Chris Bryant) to describe Trump. The author is refuting this label, not using it to attack an opponent's idea.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to popularity. Instead, it argues from the position of a persecuted minority who are speaking an unpopular truth.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests that the complex problem of terrorism in the UK is caused by a simple failure of the government to focus on the right threat, stating they “want to ignore that and shoot the messenger.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s arguments and accusations are direct and clearly stated, not deliberately vague or obscure.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author uses the support of an authority figure as evidence by quoting Donald Trump and stating, “Trump himself said it best.”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either focus on “destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism” (the correct position) or focus on Trump and “shoot the messenger” (the incorrect position), ignoring any nuance or other possibilities.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase “shoot the messenger” to dismiss criticism of Trump and the author without engaging in the substance of the criticism.

16. Red herring – Yes – The main topic is the call to ban Trump for his retweets. The author introduces the largely irrelevant list of various “jihad preachers” being admitted to the UK to distract from the specific actions of Trump and to change the subject to the UK Home Office’s alleged hypocrisy.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an argument that was not presented by redefining his opponent’s position: “For Chris Bryant, apparently ‘fascism’ means ‘defense of Britain and its values against jihad terror.’” This misrepresents Bryant’s argument to make it easier to attack.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The entire structure of the article is a form of whataboutism. In response to criticism of Trump and the author, the text repeatedly deflects by saying, “What about these jihad preachers the UK has admitted?” This is a direct attempt to charge the UK government with hypocrisy to invalidate the original criticism.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a very high number (15 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques in a coordinated effort to achieve a specific persuasive goal. The central purpose is to reframe the narrative away from the controversial actions of Donald Trump and the author, and towards a narrative where they are courageous truth-tellers being persecuted by a hypocritical and incompetent UK government that supposedly sides with extremists.

This is achieved primarily through a combination of **Whataboutism** and **Red Herring** (constantly deflecting to the issue of jihadist preachers), **Appeal to Fear** (using graphic descriptions of violence to scare the reader), **Loaded Language** (using terms like "jihad atrocities" and "Sharia supremacism" to provoke an emotional reaction), and the **Black & White Fallacy** (presenting a false choice between supporting the author or enabling terrorism). The text does not engage in reasoned, factual debate but instead relies on a dense web of logical fallacies and emotional manipulation to discredit its opponents and promote its own agenda.
