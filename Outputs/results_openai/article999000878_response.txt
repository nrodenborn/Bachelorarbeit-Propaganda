Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, repetition, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy.

However, it does not employ all possible techniques, and some parts of the text provide factual information, reducing the likelihood of it being pure propaganda.
