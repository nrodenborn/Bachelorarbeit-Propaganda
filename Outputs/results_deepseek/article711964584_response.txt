Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

**Propaganda Technique Analysis:**

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "über-left pol" (referring to Chris Bryant), "savages" (referring to those threatening violence).
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The concept of "ban" is repeated extensively (banning Geller/Spencer, banning Trump, banning Catholic ads, being banned for actions).
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – "Safe by surrender?" is a brief, memorable phrase encapsulating an argument.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – Warnings about "national suicide," threats to freedom from "sharia" and "Islamization," and the implication that surrender makes people unsafe ("When did they ever work in the history of humankind?").
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – Questioning the Dutch media claim about one video ("Even if this is true..." implies skepticism about the claim's validity or significance).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration: Calling the Geller-Spencer ban "one of that once great nation’s darkest moments," "victory of Islamic law over Western law," "national suicide," "Islamization of the West." Minimization: Downplaying the nature of the retweeted videos ("they’re just factual") and Jayda Fransen's background.
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Appeals to "British values," "freedom," "Western law," references to Lee Rigby's service, WWII ("the nation that saved their nation from extinction not 70 years ago"), and displaying flags.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "freedom-fighters," "rainbow coalition," "savages," "satinate savages," "über-left pol," "madness," "silencing and persecution," "totalitarian society," "totalitarians," "worldwide howl," "Islamization," "normed and accepted," "grim reality," "jihad terror," "sharia oppression," "voices of sanity," "national suicide," "defending British values".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – While "fascism" is mentioned (by Bryant, not the author directly as a label), the author redefines it as "defending British values," not specifically linking opponents to universally hated groups like Nazis in this instance. The "fascism" label itself is used by Bryant, whom the author attacks.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – The text does not primarily argue that the *ideas* are popular or that people should join a popular cause. It focuses on persecution, principle, and warnings.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Blaming the ban on *all* political ads in US cities solely on the desire to prevent Geller's ads ("because of the ban on all political ads that was enacted in order to prevent my ads from running").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes** – References to "Western elites," "how deeply and far and widely sharia has been normed and accepted," "voices of sanity" – these lack specific definition or evidence.
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – The author primarily relies on their own experience and perspective. No external authorities are cited as evidence for the core arguments.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – "Safe by surrender?" presents a stark, oversimplified choice between capitulation and safety through resistance, ignoring nuance. Also, "Once you sanction the silencing and persecution of one, inevitably, you’ve sanctioned it for all."
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "Once you sanction the silencing and persecution of one, inevitably, you’ve sanctioned it for all," "It’s open season on the opposition," "Who decides what’s good and what’s forbidden in a totalitarian society? The totalitarians." These phrases shut down deeper analysis.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – Introducing the story about the Catholic Church being unable to run ads in Washington D.C. distracts from the core issue of the UK travel ban requests for Geller/Spencer and Trump.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Misrepresenting Bryant's accusation of Trump supporting fascism as Bryant meaning "defending British values." The author refutes the idea that defending British values is fascism, which is not the argument Bryant made about the *retweets*.
18. **Whataboutism – Yes** – Contrasting the ban on Geller/Spencer/Trump with Britain "admitting numerous jihad preachers" ("Many of the people you have rightly banned from entering the UK were guilty of less than this" is also a form of this, implying hypocrisy in the ban criteria).

**Verdict:**

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It exhibits a very high concentration of identifiable propaganda techniques (13 out of 18 analyzed techniques are present). The core purpose is not merely to inform but to persuade through emotional manipulation (fear, anger, patriotism), demonization of opponents ("über-left pol," "savages," "totalitarians"), oversimplification of complex issues (sharia vs. freedom, safe by surrender?), diversionary tactics (red herring, whataboutism), and the creation of stark "us vs. them" narratives (defending freedom/British values vs. Islamization/surrender/totalitarianism). The author consistently presents a highly biased perspective, frames events in the most dramatic and alarming terms possible, uses loaded language pervasively, and concludes with a direct call to action ("Get the book. Buy it for friends. Educate those around you") promoting her own work as the source of truth. While it contains factual elements (e.g., the existence of the ban requests, the retweets), the presentation, framing, and argumentation overwhelmingly align with propagandistic intent. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges that the text is based on real events and expresses a viewpoint, but the *methods* used to convey that viewpoint are dominantly propagandistic.
