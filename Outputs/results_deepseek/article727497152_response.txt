### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – No  
   Explanation: The text does not use insulting labels to attack individuals or entities (e.g., it refers to "Stephen Paddock" neutrally as the "alleged shooter").

2. **Repetition** – No  
   Explanation: The core claim of a "cover-up" is stated but not excessively repeated; the text elaborates on different aspects (e.g., redactions, missing ballistics) without looping the same phrase.

3. **Slogans** – No  
   Explanation: There are no brief, memorable phrases designed for rallying (e.g., no equivalents to "Make America Great Again").

4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
   Explanation: The text implies distrust in authorities but does not explicitly invoke fear of alternatives (e.g., it doesn’t warn of dire consequences if the "cover-up" continues).

5. **Doubt** – **Yes**  
   Explanation: Explicitly questions credibility with phrases like "It appears that a further cover-up is underway" and casting suspicion on the coroner’s actions (e.g., "the coroner claims that he still has to ‘finalize’ the report despite the fact the autopsy was conducted").

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes**  
   Explanation: Uses exaggerated language like "definitively proved" regarding Paddock’s body not being recovered, a claim presented as fact without evidence. Minimizes the coroner’s compliance by framing the release as "drag[ging] his feet."

7. **Flag-waving** – No  
   Explanation: No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty.

8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes**  
   Explanation: Emotionally charged terms like "cover-up," "drag his feet," and "against public law" evoke bias and imply intentional wrongdoing.

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   Explanation: No attempt to link the coroner or events to universally hated groups (e.g., Nazis).

10. **Bandwagon** – No  
    Explanation: Does not appeal to the popularity of the "cover-up" idea or suggest widespread belief in it.

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No  
    Explanation: The text focuses on specific omissions (e.g., redacted names) but does not reduce the massacre’s causes to a single factor.

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No  
    Explanation: The text is direct in its accusations (e.g., "all names were redacted"); no unclear or confusing language is used.

13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes**  
    Explanation: Cites a judge’s ruling and an "Intellihub article" as authoritative proof, e.g., "after a judge ruled" and "Intellihub article definitively proved."

14. **Black & white fallacy** – No  
    Explanation: Presents nuances (e.g., notes ballistic fragments were given to police) rather than framing the issue as two extreme choices.

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No  
    Explanation: No phrases like "case closed" or "obviously" that shut down debate; instead, it invites scrutiny.

16. **Red herring** – No  
    Explanation: Stays focused on the autopsy reports; no irrelevant distractions are introduced.

17. **Straw men** – No  
    Explanation: Does not misrepresent opposing arguments (e.g., it addresses specific actions like redactions rather than inventing a weak counter-argument).

18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., does not say, "What about other cases where autopsies were released?").

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 80% –** The text is highly likely propaganda due to its uncritical reliance on loaded language (e.g., "cover-up"), exaggeration ("definitively proved"), manufactured doubt about official actions, and appeals to questionable authority (e.g., an unnamed Intellihub article). It omits counter-evidence (e.g., why names might be redacted for privacy) and frames neutral facts (e.g., delayed reports) as malicious. While it raises valid concerns about transparency, its one-sided, emotionally charged presentation aims to manipulate readers into accepting a conspiracy narrative without verification. The lack of sourcing for key claims (e.g., Paddock’s body "not being his") further signals bias.
