1. Name calling – No – The text does not use direct insulting labels against the migrants, instead opting for descriptive or legalistic terms like "migrants" or framing their actions as "illegal."
2. Repetition – Yes – The question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times in a row to draw attention to the poll.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not employ any brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates a sense of threat by describing "thousands of migrants" who are "undeterred" by "barbed wires and thousands of troops," portraying them as a relentless force approaching "our country."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the integrity of the US election system by stating, "the news of the migrant caravan has largely been abandoned due to the elections and what appears to be voter fraud and election meddling and manipulation across the country."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the significance of the election results by immediately pivoting to unsubstantiated claims of widespread "voter fraud and election meddling," thereby exaggerating the scale of these alleged issues.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by using the phrase "our country" and framing the migrants' actions as a "quest to enter our country illegally," creating an "us vs. them" dynamic.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The phrase "quest to enter our country illegally" uses emotionally charged language. The poll option "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass" is also loaded to create a negative association.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to groups hated by the audience, such as Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular or that the reader should agree because everyone else does.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text claims the caravan story was abandoned "due to the elections and what appears to be voter fraud," which is a simplistic and unproven cause for a complex news cycle.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The phrase "what appears to be voter fraud and election meddling and manipulation across the country" is intentionally vague, lacking specific details, evidence, or locations, which serves to create suspicion without making a falsifiable claim.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses a quote from "President Donald Trump" and cites a "report from RT" to lend credibility to its narrative.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames immigration as a binary choice between legal entry with "merit" and the migrants' "quest to enter our country illegally," ignoring the complexities and legal nuances of seeking asylum.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The poll option, "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass," is a dismissive cliché that discourages critical thought about the balance between press freedom and professional conduct.
16. Red herring – Yes – The entire section on Jim Acosta and the associated poll is irrelevant to the main topic of the migrant caravan and serves to distract the reader and collect user data.
17. Straw men – No – The text focuses on presenting its own narrative rather than misrepresenting and refuting a specific counter-argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It moves beyond simple biased reporting by employing a wide and potent array of propaganda techniques to construct a specific narrative and manipulate the reader's perception. The article's primary goal is not to inform but to influence.

It does this by:
1.  **Creating Fear and Suspicion:** It uses an appeal to fear ("undeterred" thousands), casts doubt on democratic institutions ("voter fraud"), and uses vague, unsubstantiated claims to create a sense of crisis and distrust.
2.  **Framing the Narrative:** It uses loaded language ("quest to enter... illegally"), flag-waving ("our country"), and a black & white fallacy to frame the complex issue of migration as a simple matter of legal vs. illegal, us vs. them.
3.  **Using Distraction and Deception:** The most blatant piece of evidence is the use of a red herring—the poll about Jim Acosta. This topic is completely unrelated to the migrant caravan, serving only to distract the reader, reinforce a separate political grievance, and act as a mechanism for data capture ("Completing this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates").

While the text contains some factual elements (e.g., the caravan was in Mexico City), these facts are embedded within a framework of emotional appeals, logical fallacies, and distracting content designed to promote a specific political ideology and provoke an emotional, rather than a rational, response from the reader.
