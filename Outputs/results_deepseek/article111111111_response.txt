Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against any object or subject.
2.  **Repetition** – No – While key terms like "plague" and "outbreak" are used multiple times, this is necessary for conveying the factual information. There is no deliberate repetition of a specific persuasive message.
3.  **Slogans** – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases designed for persuasion.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text repeatedly warns about the potential for a stronger, more widespread plague outbreak in the future ("The next transmission could be more pronounced or stronger", "the magnitude in the next transmission could be higher", "Madagascar could be affected more, and not only that, it could even spill over into neighbouring countries and beyond", "That's a dangerous combination"). This instills fear to support the implied message of the seriousness of the situation and the need for continued vigilance/resource allocation.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of anyone or anything; it presents information from the WHO as factual.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The statistics (200+ deaths, 2000+ cases, 300-600 average infections, resistance to insecticides) and descriptions (different behavior this year, spread to towns) are presented matter-of-factly without apparent overstatement or understatement.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – While words like "deadly," "alarm," "virulent," and "dangerous" are used, they are appropriate descriptors for a serious disease outbreak and not primarily appeals to emotion or stereotypes in a propagandistic sense. The language remains relatively neutral and descriptive.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No disapproval is linked to hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or action.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The causes presented (earlier cases, urban spread, pneumonic plague presence, widespread bacteria due to large outbreak, poor sanitation/vector control, insecticide resistance) are multiple and complex, not reduced to one simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific about the disease, its types, transmission, statistics, location, timing, and the factors contributing to future risk.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The entire report is based on statements and warnings from the WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. His position and the WHO's status are the primary sources of the information and warnings presented ("WHO chief said", "Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters", "Tedros voiced alarm", "Tedros said", "he warned").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text does not present only two choices; it describes a complex evolving situation with various factors.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used that shut down critical thinking. The text invites consideration of the factors involved.
16. **Red herring** – No – The discussion stays focused on the plague outbreak, its characteristics, response, and future risks. No irrelevant material is introduced.
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented arguments are presented or refuted.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy are made.

**Verdict – 10% –** The text primarily functions as a factual news report summarizing statements from the WHO Director-General regarding a recent plague outbreak in Madagascar and concerns about future risks. While it employs **Appeal to authority** (relying on the WHO head's statements) and contains an element of **Appeal to fear** (warnings about a potentially stronger future outbreak), these techniques are used within the context of legitimate public health communication. The warnings are based on cited reasons (unusual outbreak characteristics, increased bacterial spread, sanitation issues, insecticide resistance) and serve an informative purpose about a genuine threat, rather than promoting a specific agenda unrelated to public health. The overall tone is informative and cautionary, not overtly manipulative or deceptive. The low percentage reflects the presence of mild fear appeal and authority reliance inherent in such reporting, but the core intent appears to be information dissemination.
