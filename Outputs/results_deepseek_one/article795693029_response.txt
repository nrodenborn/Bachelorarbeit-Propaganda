Based on the definitions provided, here's the analysis of propaganda techniques used in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "illegal immigrants" (repeated), "onslaught" (repeated), "assault" (repeated). These labels attack the caravan and migrants with negative connotations.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The core message of stopping the caravan, closing the border, and blaming Mexico/Democrats is repeated multiple times within Trump's quoted tweets ("stop this onslaught", "CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!", "assault on our country", "All Democrats fault").
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: "CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!" (written in all caps for emphasis, acting as a brief, memorable phrase).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text describes the caravan as an "onslaught," "assault," including "MANY CRIMINALS," and mentions "CRIMINAL elements and DRUGS pouring in." This instills fear to support the idea of drastic action (military, border closure).
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – Explanation: While critical, the text doesn't explicitly question the credibility of a specific person or entity using doubt as defined. It asserts blame rather than casting doubt.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** (Exaggeration) – Explanation: Describing the caravan as an "onslaught" and "assault" exaggerates its nature and threat level. Claiming it includes "MANY CRIMINALS" without specific evidence is likely an exaggeration.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: "our country," "our Southern Border" (repeated), and framing the issue as protecting the country against an external "assault" appeals to patriotism/national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Numerous emotionally charged words: "illegal immigrants," "onslaught," "assault," "weak laws," "CRIMINAL elements," "DRUGS pouring in," "fault." These appeal to emotions and stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally hated groups are made in the quoted text.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not appeal to the popularity of the idea of closing the border or sending the military; it presents it as Trump's action/threat.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Blaming the situation solely on "weak laws" and exclusively attributing fault to Democrats ("All Democrats fault for weak laws!") oversimplifies the complex causes of migration and border challenges.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The threats and accusations are stated directly, not obscured by vague language. The terms used, while loaded, are clear in intent.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: While Trump speaks as President, he doesn't cite any external authority figure or institution to support his claims within the quoted text. He relies on his own position.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: "All Democrats fault for weak laws!" presents the complex issue of border security and migration as solely the fault of one political party, ignoring other contributing factors.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: While slogans and loaded terms are used, there isn't a specific phrase identified that functions purely to shut down critical thought in the manner defined.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text focuses on the caravan, border closure, blame, and threats. It doesn't introduce a significantly irrelevant topic to distract from the core issue being discussed.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text reports Trump's statements attacking Democrats' stance on immigration ("because they want Open Borders") but doesn't misrepresent an argument not actually made *within the scope of this article*. He attacks a perceived position.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: Trump does not charge his opponents (Democrats) with hypocrisy on this specific issue within the quoted text. He accuses them of policy positions ("want Open Borders") but not of hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 70% – Explanation:** The text itself is a news report *about* statements made by President Trump. The majority of the propaganda techniques identified are found *within the statements attributed to Trump* in the tweets and paraphrased comments ("onslaught," "assault," "illegal immigrants," "CRIMINAL elements," "All Democrats fault," "CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!", causal oversimplification, flag-waving, black & white fallacy). The news report accurately quotes and paraphrases these statements. While the surrounding journalistic context (reporting on caravan size, Mexican police response, border apprehension statistics) is presented relatively neutrally, the core message conveyed through Trump's quotes is heavily laden with multiple propaganda techniques designed to instill fear, assign blame, rally nationalistic sentiment, and justify extreme actions. Therefore, while the article *reports* on propaganda, the propaganda techniques are undeniably present and central to the narrative being reported, originating from the primary subject (Trump). The likelihood is high that the text serves to disseminate this propaganda, even within a reporting framework.
