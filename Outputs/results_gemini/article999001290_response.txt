1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the press as a “strong, lying, propagandizing press” and includes a poll option describing Jim Acosta’s behavior as acting “like a child.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?” is repeated three times in a row to emphasize the point and encourage participation.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea or message.

4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear about the consequences of the judge's ruling or Acosta's actions. It focuses on anger and disagreement rather than creating anxiety.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the credibility and legitimacy of the judge's ruling by using rhetorical questions like “What? Due process?” and stating “The ruling has no basis in the Constitution, mind you.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the judge's legal reasoning by dismissing it as a simple matter of “privilege, not rights,” and exaggerates Acosta’s actions by stating he “was all about lies when it came to putting his hands on a White House aide.”

7. Flag-Waving – No – While the text discusses American institutions like the White House and the Constitution, it does not make a direct appeal to patriotism to persuade the audience.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases throughout, such as “badgering,” “act like a child,” “lying, propagandizing press,” and “Give me a break!” to influence the reader's emotions.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other groups widely hated by the target audience.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. In fact, it acknowledges that “a slew of support from other media outlets” exists for the opposing view.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author reduces the complex legal issue of due process regarding a press pass to a simple, incorrect binary: “This is an issue of privilege, not rights,” ignoring the legal nuances the court considered.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s position is stated very clearly and directly. The language is blunt and unambiguous, not obscure.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from President Trump and Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, figures of authority, to support its argument against the judge's ruling and Jim Acosta.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the issue as a simple choice between a “privilege” and a “right,” ignoring the complex legal reality that exists between these two poles. The poll also primarily offers a “Yes” or “No” choice.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase “Give me a break!” to dismiss the judge's ruling without further argument, a classic technique to shut down critical thought.

16. Red herring – Yes – The author introduces Infowars into the argument (“So does Infowars. Will Judge Kelly demand the White House provide us with one as a 'right'?”), distracting from the specifics of the Acosta case by bringing in a more controversial organization to create a slippery slope fallacy.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes the argument that anyone has a “right” to a press pass, a position that CNN and Acosta did not take. Their actual argument was about the revocation of an existing pass without due process, which the author misrepresents to make it easier to attack.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes and insults its opponents, but it does not use the specific tactic of deflecting a criticism by accusing the critic of the same offense.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a neutral report of an event but a highly biased opinion piece that systematically employs numerous propaganda techniques to manipulate the reader's perception. The piece uses loaded language, name-calling, and exaggeration to create an emotional, negative portrait of Jim Acosta, CNN, and the federal judge. It relies on logical fallacies such as the straw man, red herring, and causal oversimplification to attack a misrepresented version of the opposing argument and dismiss the complex legal reasoning of the court. By appealing to the authority of the President, repeating key phrases, and casting doubt on the judicial process, the text’s primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the audience to adopt a specific partisan viewpoint and discredit opposing institutions and individuals. While it includes factual elements, such as quotes from the ruling, they are framed within a narrative designed entirely for persuasion and mobilization against a perceived enemy.
