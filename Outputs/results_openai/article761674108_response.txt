**Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, bandwagon, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to promote a specific viewpoint and discredit opposing perspectives, suggesting a high likelihood of the text being propaganda. However, not all techniques are present, and some arguments are supported with historical references, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood.**
