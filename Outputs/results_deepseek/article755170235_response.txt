### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "hardline ruling regime," "theocratic regime," "organs of oppression." These insulting labels attack Iran’s government.  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "regime change" is repeated 10+ times (e.g., "plans to spark regime change," "explicit policy of regime change").  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries (e.g., "regime change" is descriptive, not a crafted slogan like "Make America Great Again").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warns of threats from Iran’s nuclear program and regional forces if regime change doesn’t occur: "America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or acting to destroy... this capability."  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions the credibility of the JCPOA nuclear deal: "The JCPOA purposefully destroyed the... global consensus against the Islamic Republic."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates Iran’s regional actions as "military adventurism," "expansionist wars," and "malign activities." Minimizes U.S. intervention risks: "no desire to roll tanks."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to U.S. patriotism by framing regime change as necessary for national/regional security: "reduce threats against Israel and the Saudis," "root cause of chaos in the region."  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Emotionally charged terms like "tyrannical regime," "iron sandal from the necks of the people," and "world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – Claims a growing consensus against Iran: "Trump, Bolton, and Pompeo’s job to put this consensus back in place."  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames all regional instability on Iran: "chief impediment to the region is Iran’s tyrannical regime."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Language is direct (e.g., explicit discussion of "covert" support for separatist movements).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Relies on John Bolton and "sources close to the White House" to validate claims: "John is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally."  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents regime change as the only solution: "never going to fundamentally change its behavior... until that revolutionary regime is gone."  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" to halt debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – No irrelevant distractions; the focus stays on Iran.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Does not misrepresent an opposing argument.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy toward critics.

### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of manipulative techniques to advocate for U.S.-backed regime change in Iran. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language (e.g., "tyrannical regime," "iron sandal") and fear appeals (nuclear threats) dominate the narrative.  
- **Oversimplification & Bias**: Complex geopolitical issues are reduced to "Iran = root cause," ignoring other factors. The text exclusively sources regime change advocates (SSG, Bolton-aligned officials) while omitting counterarguments.  
- **Repetition & Reinforcement**: "Regime change" is relentlessly repeated, normalizing it as inevitable.  
- **Authority & Bandwagon Pressures**: Quotes from "sources close to the White House" and appeals to a restored "global consensus" lend false legitimacy.  
- **Dehumanization**: Name-calling ("theocratic regime") frames Iran’s government as inherently evil, justifying intervention.  

While based on a leaked document (adding a veneer of truth), the article selectively amplifies pro-regime-change perspectives from ideologically aligned sources (SSG, Free Beacon). It avoids critical analysis of risks, historical context (e.g., failed U.S. interventions), or Iranian perspectives. The goal is clearly to persuade readers that regime change is necessary and imminent—classic propaganda objectives. The 10% uncertainty arises from the document’s existence, but its presentation is overwhelmingly manipulative.
