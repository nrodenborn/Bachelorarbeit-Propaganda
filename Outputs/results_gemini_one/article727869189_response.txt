1. Name calling – Yes – The author labels Faggioli’s arguments as a “combination of rhetorical tricks and soft-peddled Hegelianism” and his interpretation of Catholic doctrine as “rank historicism.”
2. Repetition – No – The text argues a consistent theme, but it does not repeat the same specific message or phrase over and over in the manner of this technique.
3. Slogans – No – The text is a piece of commentary and does not employ brief, memorable phrases as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The author warns that if Faggioli’s ideas are not resisted, “we will find ourselves, in the words of Pope Benedict, in ‘a dictatorship of relativism that does not recognize anything as definitive and whose ultimate goal consists solely of one’s own ego and desires.’”
5. Doubt – Yes – The author questions the credibility of Faggioli’s arguments by describing them as “rhetorical tricks” and suggesting his position is not intellectually honest, but rather an attempt to “completely redefine the role and nature of the Catholic Church.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the impact of Faggioli’s argument by stating that he planned to “completely redefine the role and nature of the Catholic Church.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The author appeals to a shared Catholic identity by framing the debate as a fight to uphold the Church’s truth and by referencing what should be clear to “practicing Catholics.” The text states we must have recourse “to the institutions that have upheld this truth for centuries.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “theologically unsettling,” “absurd,” “dangerous historicist impulse,” and “rank historicism” to frame Faggioli’s arguments negatively.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses the same logical structure by quoting Pope Benedict, who “equates this kind of worship with the Israelites desert worship of the bull calf,” a universally condemned act in the Judeo-Christian tradition, to discredit the opposing viewpoint.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to popularity. In fact, it notes that the debate is carried on “unbeknownst to most of ‘the flock.’”
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The author does not present a simple cause for a complex event to support their own argument; rather, they engage in a more detailed, though biased, analysis.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author is very clear in their condemnation of Faggioli’s position and their support for Douthat’s. The language is pointed, not vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author quotes Pope Benedict XVI at length to support the argument against Faggioli’s position, using his authority to condemn the idea of accommodating secularism.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The author frames the debate as a binary choice between upholding “truth, and... the institutions that have upheld this truth for centuries” on one side, and succumbing to a “dangerous historicist impulse” that leads to a “dictatorship of relativism” on the other.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The author is making an argument, not using clichés to shut down thought.
16. Red herring – No – The mention of Donald Trump is used as an analogy to reinforce the author's point about objective truth, not to distract from the main argument.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author reframes Faggioli’s nuanced theological argument as a simple desire for “the Church to bend to the will of secular society.” This is a simplified and uncharitable version of Faggioli’s position, making it easier to attack as “absurd.”
18. Whataboutism – No – The author does not use this technique of charging an opponent with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly propagandistic. While it presents itself as a commentary on a debate, it does not offer a balanced or neutral summary. Instead, it systematically employs a wide range of propaganda techniques to advance a specific agenda: to discredit Professor Faggioli and his theological viewpoint while championing the position of Ross Douthat and traditionalist Catholicism. The author uses loaded language (“rank historicism,” “dangerous impulse”), name-calling (“rhetorical tricks”), and straw man arguments (claiming Faggioli wants the Church to “bend to the will of secular society”) to paint Faggioli’s position as intellectually dishonest and absurd. Furthermore, the piece relies heavily on an appeal to authority (quoting Pope Benedict XVI) and an appeal to fear (warning of a “dictatorship of relativism”) to persuade the reader. The entire debate is framed as a black & white fallacy: a choice between absolute truth and dangerous relativism. The sheer number and deliberate application of these techniques indicate the author's primary goal is not to inform, but to manipulate the reader's perception and win them over to a particular side.
