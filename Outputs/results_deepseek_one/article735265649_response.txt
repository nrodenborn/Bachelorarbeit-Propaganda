Here's the analysis of the propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – Repeatedly uses "illegals" (e.g., "arrested more than 150 illegals," "criminal illegals") instead of neutral terms like "undocumented immigrants," attaching a dehumanizing label.  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The term "illegals" is used 4 times, reinforcing the negative label.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Emphasizes threats from "criminal aliens" and claims 864 "public safety threats remain at large" to instill fear about undocumented immigrants.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No direct questioning of credibility (e.g., "Can we trust...?").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates the mayor’s actions as a "betrayal" and minimizes context for immigration (e.g., framing all arrestees primarily as criminals).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Uses emotionally charged terms like "sanctuary city," "criminal aliens," "reckless decision," "political agenda," and "betrayed the law-abiding citizens."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally despised groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "Everyone agrees...").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Does not oversimplify complex causes (focuses on ICE operations and mayor’s warning).  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Language is direct, not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Quotes ICE Deputy Director Thomas Homan to validate claims (e.g., "reckless decision was based on her political agenda").  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents a false dichotomy: politicians either support ICE or "support criminality over law and order" (e.g., "True to the left's support for criminality...").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "It is what it is" to shut down debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – No introduction of irrelevant distractions; stays focused on ICE raids and mayor’s actions.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents "the left" as supporting "criminality over law and order," implying they endorse lawlessness instead of debating sanctuary policies.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy (e.g., no "What about X group?").  

---

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely propaganda due to systematic use of manipulative techniques. Key indicators include:  
- **Dehumanizing language** ("illegals," "criminal aliens") to evoke hostility.  
- **Emotional framing** through loaded terms ("betrayed," "reckless," "sanctuary city") and fear appeals (highlighting crimes and "public safety threats").  
- **False dichotomies** portraying political opponents as anti-law enforcement.  
- **Authority appeals** using ICE statements to legitimize the narrative without counterperspectives.  
- **Straw man fallacies** misrepresenting support for sanctuary policies as endorsing criminality.  
While based on factual events (ICE arrests), the text omits context (e.g., reasons for sanctuary policies, due process concerns) and selectively emphasizes criminality to advance a specific ideology. The source (implied conservative outlet) and one-sided portrayal further indicate persuasive intent over balanced reporting.
