Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Vichy journalism" is used as an insulting label for the mainstream media, comparing their collaboration with power to the Vichy government's collaboration with the Nazis. ("I described this recently as 'Vichy journalism'...")
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The idea of "persecution" is repeated ("unprecedented persecution", "persecution of this man", "WikiLeaks witch hunt"). The concept of "collusion" is also repeated ("great deal of collusion", "collusion which amounts to", "collaboration", "collaborates").
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases designed for easy recall and repetition are used as slogans in this text. "Vichy journalism" is a label, not a slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Instills fear about the consequences of not supporting Assange: "if Julian Assange is allowed to literally go under, it represents the conquest of all of us", "it will be a great atrocity", "silence equals mass murder", and the reference to Niemoller's poem about the consequences of inaction.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Questions the motives and actions of governments: "We must ask ourselves why this hasn’t happened", "Was Hunt referring to a deal which has already been done...? I don’t know", questioning why media hasn't pressured governments.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Possible** – Explanation: "the most unprecedented persecution" could be seen as exaggeration (persecution exists elsewhere). Claims of WikiLeaks' "100% record of accuracy and authenticity" and being "the only journalistic organization" to achieve this might be debatable and lean towards exaggeration. Minimization is not prominent.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: While concepts like "justice," "freedom," and "right to know" are invoked, there is no specific appeal to patriotism or national identity to support the argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Emotionally charged words are used frequently: "unprecedented persecution", "collusion", "wretched deals", "milieu of machination", "should horrify", "rapacious establishment", "witch hunt", "vindictive personal abuse", "spirited away to some super-max hellhole", "great atrocity", "mass murder".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Explanation: Directly comparing mainstream media collaboration to the Vichy government's collaboration with the Nazis ("Vichy journalism... It collaborates in the same way that the Vichy government in France collaborated with the Nazis").
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The argument does not rely on the popularity of the idea of supporting Assange or WikiLeaks. It focuses on principle and justice, not popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Possible** – Explanation: Attributes the lack of government support for Assange primarily to "collusion" and the media's failure to pressure governments primarily to being part of a "rapacious establishment" shamed by WikiLeaks. This simplifies complex geopolitical and institutional motivations.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is generally direct and clear in its accusations and descriptions, even if controversial. Terms like "collusion" or "rapacious establishment" are loaded but not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Cites Media Lens as an authority on British press reporting ("a report by Media Lens... describing how the British press has reported"). References Niemoller's poem as moral authority.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents the situation starkly: either support Assange/WikiLeaks and fight for justice/freedom, or be complicit in persecution, atrocity, and the downfall of freedom ("if Julian Assange is allowed to literally go under, it represents the conquest of all of us", "silence equals mass murder").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: While strong conclusions are drawn ("This is about justice"), the text generally elaborates and argues its points rather than shutting down discussion with clichés.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The discussion stays focused on Assange's situation, government/media actions, and the significance of WikiLeaks. No irrelevant topics are introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text criticizes the actual positions and actions of governments and media (lack of support, collaboration, attacks) rather than misrepresenting them.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not deflect criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy on unrelated matters. It focuses directly on the subject.

**Verdict – 30% –** Explanation: While the text employs several propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Loaded Language, Reduction ad Hitlerum, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, and possibly Exaggeration and Causal Oversimplification), its primary function is persuasive advocacy and critique rather than classic propaganda. It presents specific arguments, historical references (Vichy, Niemoller), and factual claims (Assange's lack of charges, WikiLeaks' document releases) to support its viewpoint defending Assange and WikiLeaks while condemning governments and mainstream media. The techniques serve to emphasize urgency, assign blame, and frame the issue morally, but the core relies on asserted facts and a clear (though one-sided) argumentative structure. The likelihood of it being *primarily* propaganda is low; it's more accurately described as highly opinionated, emotionally charged advocacy journalism or commentary using some propagandistic elements for rhetorical effect.
