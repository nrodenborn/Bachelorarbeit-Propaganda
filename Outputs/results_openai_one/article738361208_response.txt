Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, and the black & white fallacy. These techniques suggest a bias against the appointments of Pompeo and Haspel, framing them in a negative light by emphasizing controversial aspects of their past actions and policies. While the text provides factual information, the use of emotionally charged language and the presentation of a binary choice contribute to a likelihood of propaganda. However, the absence of other techniques such as name calling, slogans, and whataboutism indicates that the text is not heavily propagandistic.
