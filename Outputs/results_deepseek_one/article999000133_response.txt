Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Don Lemon Is Lying... Again", "spewing more fake news". Insults used to discredit Lemon and CNN.  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "Should military force be used to stop the caravan..." repeated 3 times in the poll.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "fake news" is a brief, memorable phrase used pejoratively.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Poll question implies migrants pose a threat requiring military force, and the article suggests women/minorities are greater terror threats than white men.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Is Don Lemon colorblind? Is the FBI racist (and maybe a bit sexist)?" Questions Lemon's perception and the FBI's motives.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates women's role in terrorism ("WOMEN [...] responsible for more terrorism") while minimizing white male extremism via selective FBI list data.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No overt appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "spewing more fake news", "absurdity", "demonizing". Emotionally charged terms.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No Nazi/Vichy comparisons or similar references.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No explicit appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Reduces complex terrorism dynamics to demographics ("only 3 white men?"), ignoring socioeconomic/ideological factors.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – Uses FBI list without context (e.g., timeframe, criteria, or severity of threats), creating misleading implications.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Uses FBI's "Most Wanted" list as definitive proof to refute Lemon.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Poll forces binary choice on military force ("Yes" or "No"), ignoring nuanced solutions.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "CNN doing what CNN does… spewing more fake news" shuts down critical analysis of Lemon's actual argument.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introduces migrant caravan poll (unrelated to domestic terrorism discussion) to distract.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents Lemon's argument as claiming "only white men" are terrorists, then refutes this fabricated premise.  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Counters Lemon's focus on white male extremism by shifting focus to minority/women terrorists ("5 women. 3 Hispanic men...").  

---

**Verdict – 95%** – The text exhibits extensive use of propaganda techniques to advance a specific narrative. Key indicators include:  
- **Misrepresentation**: Constructs a straw man version of Don Lemon’s argument (ignoring his focus on *radicalization* and *threat level*).  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language ("lying," "fake news") and name-calling vilify opponents.  
- **Distortion of Facts**: Selectively uses FBI data (14 individuals) to dismiss systemic concerns about white supremacist violence, ignoring broader FBI reports citing right-wing extremism as a top threat.  
- **Agenda-Driven Framing**: The migrant caravan poll and demographic breakdown divert attention from Lemon’s core argument, while repetition and binary framing polarize readers.  
- **Source Discrediting**: Attacks CNN’s credibility instead of engaging with evidence.  
The text’s reliance on emotional appeals, logical fallacies, and cherry-picked data overwhelmingly serves to propagandize rather than inform, leaving minimal room for balanced discourse.
