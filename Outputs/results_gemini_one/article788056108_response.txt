Here are the propaganda techniques and whether they are used in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly uses insulting labels to attack Pope Francis (referred to as Bergoglio), such as "monster," "power-mad ecclesiastical tyrant," "The Dictator Pope," "papal malefactor," and "wolf."
2.  Repetition – Yes – The core message that Pope Francis is a threat who must be removed is repeated throughout the text in various forms. For instance, the idea is stated as "a grave threat to the common good of the Church," "The only remedies for the plague of Bergoglio are his natural death or deposition," and concludes with "No, Bergoglio must go."
3.  Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases to crystallize its argument, such as "The Dictator Pope must destroy his most potent critic thus far. Everything depends on it!" and the concluding demand, "No, Bergoglio must go."
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by portraying Pope Francis's pontificate as a catastrophic event for the Church. Example: "Surely the Church cannot be without any remedy for a Pope who relentlessly attacks her very foundations!"
5.  Doubt – Yes – The entire article is framed to cast doubt on the legitimacy and morality of Pope Francis. The very title, "Can the Church Defend Herself Against Bergoglio?", introduces this theme, which is reinforced with questions like, "But why is Fisher still “working as hard as I can not to assume the worst” when there is no longer anything to assume...?"
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses hyperbole to describe the situation. Example: "are we not in the midst of schisms already, provoked by none other than Bergoglio himself, whose insane drive to shatter the Church’s bimillennial discipline has produced the totally unprecedented situation..."
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the reader's Catholic identity and sense of duty to protect the Church. Example: "The successors of the Apostles, the only ones in a position to end his rampage, must demand his resignation... to declare his removal from the office he has criminally abused and whose very credibility he threatens to destroy."
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the reader's perception. Example: "Bergoglio’s cunning response," "damning indictment," "preening, Internet-created neo-Catholic doyenne," and "loathsome traditionalists."
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text compares Pope Francis to a dictator ("The Dictator Pope") and a historically corrupt pope (Benedict IX), but it does not use the specific technique of disapproving of an idea by associating it with Nazis or other groups hated by the target audience in the way the definition describes.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that a growing number of important people support its position, encouraging the reader to join them. Example: "At last count, some 29 bishops have publicly declared Viganò’s allegations against Bergoglio credible and worthy of investigation."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents the complex crisis in the Church as having a single, simple cause: a bad pope who must be removed. Example: "The only remedies for the plague of Bergoglio are his natural death or deposition."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague or obscure. Its purpose is to be direct and clear in its condemnation of Pope Francis, making very specific and aggressive accusations.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on quoting figures of authority to validate its claims, including Archbishop Viganò, canonist Edward Peters, Cardinal Eijk, and Pope Benedict XVI. Example: "Now even the distinguished canonist Edward Peters... declares that if Viganò’s allegations are true then Bergoglio must go."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as having only two possible outcomes, ignoring other possibilities. Example: "Either the human element of the Church will act according to the means which seem possible, however extraordinary, or Heaven itself will intervene in a manner that might well involve a divine chastisement..."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The article does not use clichés to shut down debate. Instead, it attempts to build a complex (though one-sided) argument to encourage a specific line of thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a lengthy critique of Simcha Fisher's character, past statements, and motives, which distracts from the central argument about Pope Francis to attack a secondary figure. Example: "I never thought I’d see the day when a preening, Internet-created neo-Catholic doyenne such as Simcha Fisher, as notorious as Mark Shea for her crude and often unprintable invective against traditionalists, would unload on Pope Bergoglio..."
17. Straw men – Yes – The text sets up and refutes an oversimplified version of an opposing argument. Example: "These lessons of history should suffice to dispel the pious fable, never a teaching of the Magisterium, that every Pope is chosen by the Holy Ghost to lead the Church." This attacks a simplistic "pious fable" rather than a more nuanced theological position.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses on direct accusations against Pope Francis and does not attempt to deflect criticism by charging his accusers with hypocrisy for similar offenses.

***

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. It is not a balanced piece of journalism or theological reflection but a polemical attack piece designed to persuade the reader of a single, extreme viewpoint: that the sitting Pope is an illegitimate tyrant who must be deposed.

The author systematically employs a vast arsenal of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. The piece is saturated with **loaded language** and **name-calling** ("monster," "tyrant," "wolf") to create an immediate and powerful emotional revulsion toward its target. It uses **appeal to fear** and **exaggeration** to frame the situation as the "worst crisis" in Church history, creating a sense of extreme urgency.

To build its case, the text relies heavily on **appeal to authority**, selectively quoting cardinals and canon lawyers who support its view, while simultaneously using **doubt** to undermine the Pope's credibility. It creates a sense of momentum with the **bandwagon** technique ("29 bishops...") and simplifies a multifaceted crisis into a **black & white fallacy** where the only solution is the Pope's removal (**causal oversimplification**). The argument is framed as a righteous crusade to save the Church (**flag-waving**), making agreement with the author seem like an act of faith. The combination and intensity of these techniques leave little room for critical thought or alternative perspectives, marking the text as a clear and potent piece of propaganda.
