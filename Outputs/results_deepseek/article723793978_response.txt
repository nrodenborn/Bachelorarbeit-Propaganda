Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – While the Sweden Democrats are labeled "populist" and "opposition", these are descriptive political terms, not inherently insulting labels aimed at attacking them. The text does not use insults like "traitors" or "extremists".
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The threat and nature of grenade attacks are repeated: mentioned in the Reuters report ("One man died after picking up a hand grenade"), reiterated by Akesson ("people are killed by hand grenades"), and highlighted again in the final comment ("Wikipedia has a page... which lists 80 different attacks").
3.  **Slogans** – No – There is no distinct, brief, memorable phrase used repeatedly to encapsulate the message (e.g., "Make Sweden Safe Again"). Akesson's "This is the new Sweden" is descriptive and sarcastic, but not a crafted slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text vividly describes deadly violence (shootings in pizza restaurants, deaths from grenades found on streets) and frames it as a consequence of immigration/multicultural policies, instilling fear against those alternatives. Akesson's sarcastic "multicultural paradise" directly links the fear to immigration.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The text explicitly casts doubt on the police's ability to cope ("Swedes are worried that the police are unable to cope") and implicitly doubts the success of multicultural policies through Akesson's sarcasm.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The final comment ("From Reuters: Wikipedia has a page... which lists 80 different attacks beginning in 2014. That’s crazy.") uses the Wikipedia list (presented without context like population, overall crime trends, or grenade type/origin) to exaggerate the scale and uniqueness of the problem, implying an extreme level of violence uncommon elsewhere. It also minimizes Sweden's overall safety ("Sweden’s murder rate is relatively low in international terms") by immediately focusing on the surge in gang violence.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no direct appeal to Swedish patriotism or national identity to support the argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Akesson's sarcastic description "the new, exciting dynamic, multicultural paradise" is heavily loaded with negative connotations, ridiculing multiculturalism. Words like "wave of gang violence", "string of deadly shootings", and the standalone comment "That’s crazy" also use emotionally charged language.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There are no comparisons made to Nazis, Hitler, or universally hated groups to disapprove of immigration or multicultural policies.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – It states "Law and order is likely to be a major issue... with the populist, opposition Sweden Democrats linking public concern about the rising crime rate to... immigrants." This frames the immigration-crime link as a response to existing popular concern, appealing to its perceived popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text strongly implies, primarily through Akesson's statement and the surrounding context, that the complex issue of rising gang violence (potentially involving socioeconomics, policing, drug markets) has a single, simple cause: increased immigration and multicultural policies ("the new, exciting dynamic, multicultural paradise that so many here... have fought to create").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is relatively direct in reporting events and statements. While it doesn't provide deep context for the grenade list, it's not deliberately obscure or confusing in its language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text leverages Reuters as a credible source at the beginning ("Reuters Staff", "STOCKHOLM (Reuters)") and later uses "From Reuters:" to introduce the Wikipedia reference, using this established news agency's name to bolster the credibility of the information about grenade attacks.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Akesson's sarcasm presents a stark choice: the current state of violence ("People are shot to death... people are killed by hand grenades") is portrayed as the direct, inevitable result of the multicultural policies championed by others in parliament. It simplifies the issue to multiculturalism = violence, ignoring other factors.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Akesson's sarcastic phrase "the new, exciting dynamic, multicultural paradise" acts as a thought-terminating cliché. It dismisses the complex arguments for multiculturalism with a single, emotionally charged, mocking phrase that discourages further critical discussion of the policy's merits or the violence's root causes.
16. **Red herring** – No – The core discussion revolves around gang violence, immigration, and policy. While the Wikipedia grenade list detail might be slightly tangential, it's directly related to the evidence of violence presented earlier, not a deliberate distraction onto a completely irrelevant topic.
17. **Straw men** – No – The arguments referenced (e.g., the promotion of multiculturalism) are not misrepresented. Akesson sarcastically attributes the violence to the *actual* goals of those who supported multicultural policies, even if his causation is oversimplified.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge opponents with hypocrisy by pointing to their own misdeeds or inconsistencies. It criticizes their policies directly.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it starts with factual reporting from Reuters, it selectively frames this information and integrates the Sweden Democrat leader's highly charged, sarcastic commentary. It employs multiple propaganda techniques: primarily **Appeal to Fear** (vivid descriptions of violence), **Loaded Language** (sarcasm like "multicultural paradise", "crazy"), **Causal Oversimplification** (linking violence simplistically to immigration/multiculturalism), **Bandwagon** (citing public concern), **Black & White Fallacy** (presenting multicultural policy as the clear cause of violence), **Thought-Terminating Clichés** (using the sarcastic phrase to shut down debate), **Exaggeration** (using the grenade list dramatically without context), and **Appeal to Authority** (leveraging Reuters). The overall intent is not just to inform but to persuade the audience that immigration and multiculturalism are the direct, primary causes of violent crime in Sweden, using emotional manipulation and oversimplification rather than balanced analysis of complex social factors. The concluding "That's crazy" reinforces this persuasive, non-neutral stance.
