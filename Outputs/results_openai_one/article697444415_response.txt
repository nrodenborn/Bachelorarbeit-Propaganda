12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – Phrases like “various other reports,” “growing belief,” and “we are not being told what actually happened” are vague and lack specifics.

**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits numerous propaganda techniques, including repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, bandwagon, causal oversimplification, and intentional vagueness. These techniques are used to cast doubt on the official narrative, stoke suspicion, and emotionally influence the reader toward believing in a conspiracy. The use of emotionally charged language, repetition of unverified claims, and appeals to collective belief are strong indicators of propaganda. While the text does present a personal testimony, the framing and language choices strongly suggest an intent to persuade the audience toward a particular, conspiratorial viewpoint rather than objectively inform, making it highly likely (85%) that this text is propaganda.
