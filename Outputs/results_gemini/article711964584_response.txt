1. Name calling – Yes – The author refers to those who threatened violence in response to her planned event as “savages.” She also refers to a political opponent as an “über-left pol” and her opponents in general as “totalitarians.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the West is succumbing to Islamic law is repeated, for example, in the phrases “It was the victory of Islamic law over Western law, sharia over freedom” and “further proof of the Islamization of the West.”
3. Slogans – Yes – The author uses short, memorable phrases like “Safe by surrender?” and “It’s open season on the opposition” to make a point.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that banning certain voices will lead to a “path to national suicide” and the loss of freedom for future generations.
5. Doubt – Yes – The author questions the media’s credibility by stating, “Once again the media are blaming the messenger instead of dealing with Islamic violence.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates by calling the Geller-Spencer ban “one of that once great nation’s darkest moments” and minimizes her planned actions as simply wanting to “pay our respects to Lee Rigby.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The author appeals to patriotism by mentioning plans to “bring the Stars and Stripes, as well as British and Danish flags” and reminding the audience that the US “saved their nation from extinction not 70 years ago.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like “savages,” “madness,” “freedom-fighters,” and “national suicide” to influence the audience’s perception.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The author equates the actions of the British government with totalitarianism by asking, “Who decides what’s good and what’s forbidden in a totalitarian society? The totalitarians.” This links her opponents to hated totalitarian regimes.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its ideas are correct because they are popular; in fact, it presents its viewpoint as being in opposition to the mainstream elites.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author attributes the complex political decision to ban her and the call to ban Trump to a single cause: “the Islamization of the West.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s language is direct and her position is clear; she does not use vague or obscure expressions to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text argues against established authorities (the British government, Theresa May) rather than using them as support for its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark choice between two options: “Islamic law over Western law, sharia over freedom,” and between a path to freedom and a “path to national suicide,” ignoring any other possibilities or nuances.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “It’s open season on the opposition” is used to frame the situation as a simple conflict, discouraging a more nuanced discussion of the political events.
16. Red herring – Yes – The author introduces the story of the Catholic Church being unable to run bus ads in Washington, D.C., which is an irrelevant distraction from the central topic of entry bans in the U.K.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an argument that was not made by stating, “‘Fascism.’ By that Bryant means ‘defending British values.’” This misrepresents the opponent’s actual argument about condoning far-right groups and refutes a simplified, distorted version instead.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The author accuses the British government of hypocrisy by pointing out that it is “admitting numerous jihad preachers” while banning her and others she aligns with, deflecting from the reasons for her own ban.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. It employs an overwhelming majority (15 out of 18) of the listed techniques to advance its message. The author’s primary method is not reasoned debate but emotional manipulation and the creation of a stark, good-versus-evil narrative.

The text constructs a world of black-and-white fallacies, where the author and her allies are “freedom-fighters” on a path of “sanity,” while their opponents are “totalitarians,” “über-left,” and complicit in a surrender to “savages” that will lead to “national suicide.” This narrative is reinforced through loaded language, name-calling, and appeals to fear.

Instead of engaging with the substance of the accusations against her or Trump (e.g., the specific content of the videos, the legal definitions of hate speech), the author uses logical fallacies like straw men (redefining “fascism” as “defending British values”), whataboutism (pointing to “jihad preachers”), and red herrings (the D.C. bus ads) to distract and reframe the debate. The entire complex issue of immigration, free speech, and national security is reduced to a single, simple cause: the “Islamization of the West.”

The purpose is not to inform or persuade through evidence and logic, but to rally a base, demonize the opposition, and promote a specific ideology by bypassing critical thought. The call to action at the end—"Get the book. Buy it for friends. Educate those around you."—cements its nature as a piece designed to spread a particular doctrine, which is the ultimate goal of propaganda.
