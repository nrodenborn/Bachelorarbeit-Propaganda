Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Sharia New Mexico," "jihadis," "Islamic compound jihadis" (insulting labels for the suspects and location).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No concise, memorable phrases unrelated to other techniques (e.g., "Shame!" is emotional but not a standalone slogan).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "children were [...] taught multiple tactical techniques in order to kill teachers, law enforcement" (instills fear about the suspects' threat).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Shame on those who are supposed to uphold law and justice!" (questions the integrity of the justice system).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "Sharia trumps dead children"; Minimization: Downplays the Bundy case ("no one hurt a single person!" vs. their jail time).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "jihadis," "thought crushing device," "shame," "folly," "squalor" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on the popularity of an idea to persuade.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames the suspects' release solely on "Islamophobia" claims, ignoring legal complexities.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Language is direct and inflammatory, not vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No cited endorsements from experts or figures.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – "If they had been Christian and white [...] we might not be here today" (frames treatment as solely based on religion/race).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Sharia trumps dead children" (shuts down nuance about legal vs. religious factors).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The Brett Kavanaugh poll distracts from the main story.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Claims media would obsess over "toxic Christianity" if suspects were white Christians (refutes an unproven hypothetical).  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – "The Bundys and their supporters got nearly two years in jail" (diverts to unrelated case to accuse hypocrisy).  

---

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 13/18 identified techniques, including inflammatory name-calling ("jihadis"), fearmongering (children trained to kill), loaded language, and logical fallacies (black/white dichotomy, whataboutism). It minimizes counter-narratives (e.g., downplaying the Bundy case’s severity) while exaggerating Islamic threats ("Sharia trumps dead children"). The inclusion of an irrelevant poll (red herring) and emotionally manipulative phrasing ("Unbelievable!", "Shame!") further reveal an intent to provoke outrage rather than inform. The sourcing (Pamela Geller, a known anti-Islam activist) and one-sided framing confirm a deliberate agenda to vilify Islam and undermine judicial integrity. While based on real events, the selective facts and manipulative techniques place this firmly in propaganda territory.
