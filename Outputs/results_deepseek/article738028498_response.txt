---

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs **Appeal to Fear** (exaggerated pandemic severity), **Loaded Language** ("WIPEOUT," "sinister"), **Name Calling** ("vaccine-pharma cartels"), and **Straw Men** (misrepresenting WHO's goals). While it cites real experts and events (Madagascar plague), these are framed to support alarmist claims. The inclusion of Mike Adams—a known conspiracy theorist—and the polemical shift toward vaccines (a **Red Herring**) further reveals an agenda to manipulate emotions and discredit institutions. The sensationalized headline, selective facts, and lack of balanced context confirm propaganda intent. The 5% uncertainty stems from the partial basis in legitimate health concerns (e.g., Dr. Tedros’ warnings).
