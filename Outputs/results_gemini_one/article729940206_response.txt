Name calling – Yes – The author attacks sociology with insulting labels, calling it part of "ridiculous courses," a "toxic stew of racism and meaningless jargon," and a "perfect storm of sociology stupidity."

Repetition – No – While the theme of sociology being foolish is reinforced, no specific message or phrase is repeated in the manner of the example.

Slogans – Yes – The author uses "Sociology." as a stand-alone, one-word paragraph, functioning as a brief, memorable, and dismissive punchline.

Appeal to fear – No – The text uses ridicule and contempt, but it does not attempt to instill fear in the reader about sociology or any other alternative.

Doubt – Yes – The author questions the credibility of the entire field of sociology with statements like "You really don't need to know anything," and sarcastically questions the professor's ability to determine facts with the rhetorical question, "Who can really say?"

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the influence and nature of an entire academic field based on a single anecdote, stating, "Sociology helped generate a whole range of fake new academic subjects while corrupting existing ones into a toxic stew of racism and meaningless jargon."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use an appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its argument.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words intended to create a negative impression, such as "toxic stew," "meaningless jargon," "absolute ignorance," and "sociology stupidity."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea to persuade the audience.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author attributes a professor's individual error to an entire, complex academic field, implying that "sociology" is the simple cause for the professor's ignorance.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's argument, while fallacious, is presented in clear and direct language. The author accuses sociology of using "meaningless jargon," but does not use it themselves.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The author uses the student's correct appeal to an authoritative source to bolster her case and, by extension, the author's own argument against the professor. The text quotes the student: "The research starter on the SNHU’s Shapiro library written by John Pearson (2013) states, that Australia is the 'sixth-largest country in the world'".

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The author presents a false dichotomy between objective fact (represented by the student) and the world of "sociology" where facts are supposedly subjective ("But we are in the age of, 'My truth'").

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author uses the sarcastic phrase "Of course she does" after noting the professor's PhD to dismiss her credentials without argument. The final line, "Who can really say?", is a cliché used sarcastically to discourage any further thought on the matter.

Red herring – Yes – The author attacks the field of sociology for an error made by a professor who, the text states, "has a PhD in philosophy." By focusing the blame on sociology, the author distracts from the fact that the professor is not even a sociologist, which weakens the central premise of the argument.

Straw men – Yes – The author creates a caricature of sociology as a field that requires "absolute ignorance" and is based on subjective "truth" rather than facts. This distorted version of the discipline is then easily attacked and ridiculed.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge an opponent with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform the reader about an incident but to persuade the reader to adopt an extremely negative and hostile view of the entire academic field of sociology. It achieves this by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques. The author seizes upon a single, anecdotal event—a professor (of philosophy, not sociology) making a factual error—and uses it as a basis for sweeping, exaggerated generalizations and name-calling against sociology ("toxic stew," "sociology stupidity"). The author builds a straw man of the discipline, portraying it as a field where facts are irrelevant, and then attacks this caricature. The use of loaded language, causal oversimplification, and sarcastic, thought-terminating clichés all serve to manipulate the reader's emotions and shut down critical thinking, guiding them toward the author's preconceived conclusion. The piece is structured as a polemic, not a reasoned argument or a neutral report.
