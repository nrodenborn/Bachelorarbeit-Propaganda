***

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it presents itself as a factual news report, it employs numerous propaganda techniques to construct a one-sided narrative that is highly critical of Jim Acosta and CNN, while justifying the actions of the Trump administration. The consistent use of Loaded Language ("belligerently," "ignorantly blathered") and Name Calling ("Trump-hating") frames Acosta and his allies negatively. The technique of Minimization is used to downplay the severity of revoking a press pass ("isn’t exactly a grave hardship"). Furthermore, the article uses Causal Oversimplification to reduce a complex legal and constitutional issue to a simple matter of Acosta's poor behavior. By selectively using quotes (Appeal to Authority) and misrepresenting Acosta's victory statement (Straw Man), the text actively persuades the reader to adopt the White House's perspective rather than providing a neutral and balanced account of the event.
