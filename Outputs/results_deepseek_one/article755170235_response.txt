Based on the definitions provided and the text "Leaked Doc Reveals White House Planning 'Regime Change' In Iran," here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text uses derogatory labels like "hardline ruling regime," "theocratic regime," and "organs of oppression" to describe Iran's government.  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "regime change" is repeated 10 times, reinforcing the central theme.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Make America Great Again") are used; the text relies on descriptive language.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Warns of threats like a "nuclear-armed Iran," "chaos and violence in the region," and Iran's "malign activities" to justify regime change.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Questions the credibility of the Obama administration's Iran policy (e.g., "the JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggerates Iranian social media outrage ("more outraged about internal oppression") and minimizes U.S. military intervention ("no desire to roll tanks").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to U.S. interests by framing regime change as a path to a "less dangerous Iran" and protecting allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia.

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses vague references like "regional sources," "other methods," and "overt and covert" support without specifics.

**Verdict – 85% – Explanation**:  
The text is highly likely to be propaganda due to its systematic use of persuasive techniques to advocate for U.S.-led regime change in Iran. Key indicators include:  
- **Sourcing bias**: Relies heavily on anonymous "sources," a pro-regime-change think-tank (SSG), and figures like John Bolton without balancing perspectives.  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded language (e.g., "tyrannical regime," "iron sandal") and fear appeals (nuclear threats, terrorism) dominate.  
- **Oversimplification**: Reduces Iran's regional influence to a singular "root cause" and presents regime change as a simple solution.  
- **Repetition and framing**: The term "regime change" is relentlessly repeated, while the Obama-era policy is framed as detrimental.  
- **One-sided advocacy**: No counterarguments or critiques of the regime change plan are included, and the text aligns closely with the Trump administration's documented stance.  
While it reports on a leaked document (a factual element), the selective framing, omission of opposing views, and reliance on emotionally charged techniques align with propaganda. The 15% uncertainty reflects the presence of attributed quotes and the leaked-document premise, but these are leveraged to advance a persuasive agenda.
