1. Name calling – No – The text reports on events and quotes individuals but does not use insulting labels to attack anyone.
2. Repetition – Yes – The demand to make the Mueller report public is repeated by multiple Democratic candidates. Example: "This report should be made public immediately," "The Special Counsel report must be publicly released in its entirety," "release the Mueller report to the American public," and "Special counsel Mueller’s report should be made public without any delay."
3. Slogans – Yes – The text quotes several short, memorable phrases used to galvanize support. Example: Elizabeth Warren's simple, powerful demand "Now." and MoveOn.org's rallying cry "Trump Is Not Above the Law."
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text quotes a statement that implies a negative outcome if their demands are not met, instilling fear of a government cover-up. Example: "Should Barr announce his intention to cover up Mueller’s report, we would take to the streets in ‘Trump Is Not Above the Law’ rapid-response protests around the country."
5. Doubt – Yes – The collective demands and threats implicitly question the credibility and intentions of Attorney General Barr. Example: The statement from MoveOn.org about a potential "cover up" is designed to cast doubt on whether Barr will be transparent.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text is a report on political demands and does not itself exaggerate or minimize the facts of the situation.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text quotes politicians appealing to patriotism and the rights of citizens to justify their demands. Example: "The American people deserve to know the full truth" and "The American people have a right to know its findings."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text quotes language that is emotionally charged to influence the audience. Example: The phrases "cover up" and "obstructing this criminal investigation" are used to evoke strong negative emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not contain any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The article creates a sense of overwhelming, unified support for an idea by listing a series of prominent politicians and an activist group all making the same demand. This encourages the reader to join the popular consensus.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not attempt to explain the cause of a complex event with a simple reason.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The language used in the article and the quotes is direct and clear in its demands.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article is structured around quoting figures of authority (Senators, presidential candidates) to lend weight to the central demand. Example: "Attorney General Barr—release the Mueller report to the American public. Now." uses Senator Elizabeth Warren's authority to strengthen the call to action.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text quotes a statement that presents only two possibilities: full transparency or a malicious cover-up. Example: The MoveOn.org statement implies that if the report is not released as they demand, the only other possibility is that Barr intends to "cover up" its findings, ignoring other potential outcomes like legally required redactions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not contain phrases intended to shut down discussion.
16. Red herring – No – The article and the quotes within it remain focused on the central topic of the Mueller report's release.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that was not presented by an opponent.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an opponent by accusing them of hypocrisy on an unrelated issue.

Verdict – 20% – The text itself is a news report and not a direct piece of propaganda. Its primary function is to report on the statements of political figures. However, it exhibits a low level of propagandistic effect due to its structure and content selection. The article almost exclusively amplifies the voices of one side of the political spectrum (Democrats) who are using numerous propaganda techniques (Repetition, Slogans, Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear, etc.) to create a persuasive narrative and apply public pressure. While it includes a brief, balancing quote from AG Barr, the overwhelming weight of the article is dedicated to disseminating the Democrats' coordinated messaging campaign. Therefore, while it maintains a journalistic format, its effect is to serve as a platform for one side's propaganda, making it slightly propagandistic by proxy rather than by its own assertion.
