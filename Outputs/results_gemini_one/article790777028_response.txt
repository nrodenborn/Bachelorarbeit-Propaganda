Name calling – Yes – The text labels political opponents with insulting terms, such as "Democrat Temper Tantrum" and "RINO Republican Senator Jeff Flake."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the exact same poll question three times in a row: "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?"

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea or message.

Appeal to fear – No – The text predicts a negative political outcome ("a circus") but does not attempt to instill fear in the audience about an alternative idea or a threat to their well-being.

Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the credibility of the allegations against Kavanaugh, stating there is "zero evidence" and that everything submitted has "refuted her claims."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the Democrats' actions by calling them a "temper tantrum" and minimizes the allegations by claiming there is "zero evidence," which is an overstatement as a formal accusation had been made.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its argument.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's opinion, such as "smear," "slanderous accusations," and "political hit."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Nazis or other universally hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex political decision to authorize an FBI investigation to a single, simple cause: "Senate Democrat temper tantrums and RINO Republican Senator Jeff Flake's desire."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its viewpoint and accusations, not intentionally vague or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the fact that Judge Kavanaugh has been through "at least 6 FBI background checks" as evidence that another one is unnecessary, appealing to the authority and thoroughness of the previous investigations.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two possible outcomes for the FBI investigation: "Absolutely nothing will be found, and this will have been a huge waste of time or (2) look for this thing to expand and... make this more of a circus."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase "this has been nothing but a political hit" to dismiss the legitimacy of the opposing viewpoint and discourage further critical thought on the matter.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a completely irrelevant poll ("Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?") which serves only to distract the reader from the main topic.

Straw men – Yes – The text mischaracterizes the call for an investigation as a "temper tantrum" based on "zero evidence," refuting this simplified and distorted position rather than addressing the actual argument that a credible accusation warranted further inquiry.

Whataboutism – No – The text attacks opponents directly but does not attempt to charge them with hypocrisy by pointing to an unrelated failing of their own.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a majority (11 out of 18) of the listed techniques to construct a highly biased and persuasive narrative rather than an objective report of events. The article's primary goal is not to inform but to shape the reader's opinion by using emotionally charged and manipulative language. Techniques like **Name Calling** ("Democrat Temper Tantrum"), **Loaded Language** ("smear," "political hit"), and **Causal Oversimplification** frame the opposition as irrational and malicious. The use of a **Straw Man** argument misrepresents the reasons for the investigation, making them easier to attack. Furthermore, the inclusion of a completely irrelevant **Red Herring** poll and the use of a **Thought-Terminating Cliché** to end the article demonstrate a clear intent to manipulate the reader's focus and shut down critical thinking. The sheer density and combination of these techniques confirm the text's nature as political propaganda.
