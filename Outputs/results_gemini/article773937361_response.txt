Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – Explanation: The text labels opponents with insulting terms, such as referring to some bishops as “manifestly evil and apostate men,” “wolves,” and “our enemies.” It also contrasts the “Good Tobin” with the “Bad Tobin.”

Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The core message that the Church hierarchy is corrupt, that faithful priests are vulnerable, and that the laity must create independent structures is repeated throughout the text in various forms. The concept of the “New Paradigm” is also used repeatedly to define the current state of the Church.

Slogans – Yes – Explanation: The text uses brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate ideas, such as the title and recurring question, “What’s your trade?” and the definitive statement, “McCarrick is the ‘New Church.’”

Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation: The text instills fear by describing a future where faithful priests will be rendered “homeless, penniless and jobless” and “blackballed for his authentic Catholicity” by a corrupt hierarchy. It also warns of a “general collapse of the institution” and a “state of emergency.”

Doubt – Yes – Explanation: The text systematically casts doubt on the credibility of the entire Catholic hierarchy, including those considered “good bishops.” For example, it states that even the “‘good bishops’ have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs,” questioning their awareness and competence.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: The text exaggerates the scope of the problem by claiming “nearly the entire episcopate of the United States either colluded directly or kept quiet about it.” It also minimizes the position of opponents, such as describing Bishop Tobin as a “hapless ‘conservative’” to dismiss his viewpoint.

Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation: The text appeals to the identity of “faithful Catholics” by framing the conflict as a battle to preserve the “authentic Catholic life” and the “Deposit of the Faith” against enemies within the Church, urging “we who still love the Church” to take action.

Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: The text is replete with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to evoke a strong reaction, such as “furious mobs,” “lame whitewashing attempt,” “grotesquely corrupt,” and describing the scandal as a “toxic emission” from a “rotting thing.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – Explanation: The text disapproves of the current hierarchy's actions by comparing the situation to those created by hated historical groups/events. It explicitly compares the need to save the Faith to the curators of the Hermitage Museum hiding art from “the advancing German army” during the Siege of Leningrad and to the persecution of Catholics in “the England of Henry VIII.”

Bandwagon – Yes – Explanation: The text suggests a growing movement of outrage and action among the laity, implying that the reader should join in. It states, “quite a few lay Catholics just aren’t having it” and “I am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures.”

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: The text presents a simple cause for the complex crisis in the Church: “The Church was infiltrated, we know this, in the 19th century by some pretty dark forces, and they have finally come into the ascendancy,” specifically identifying a “homosexualist cabal” that uses blackmail as its primary tool of control.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – Explanation: While often direct, the text uses vague phrasing at times to imply wrongdoing without making a direct, falsifiable claim. For instance, it refers to the Church being infiltrated by “some pretty dark forces” and the footnote about Cardinal Farrell ends with the vague suggestion that “someone in a journalistic capacity might want to be asking a few questions about these things too.”

Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation: The text cites other writers and figures (Rod Dreher, Steve Skojec, Henry Sire) as authorities to lend credibility to its arguments. For example, “Rod Dreher is doing excellent work compiling testimony...” and “As our friend Steve Skojec put it the other day...”

Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation: The text presents a stark dichotomy with few or no middle options: “The Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else.” It also frames the hierarchy as either being a Catholic or “a wolf,” leaving no room for nuance.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Explanation: The text uses phrases that present a conclusion as final and discourages further thought. For example, the declaration that the men in charge “are, in short, our enemies” is designed to end any debate about the nature of the hierarchy and solidify them as an opposing force.

Red herring – Yes – Explanation: While arguing for the financial independence of priests, the text introduces a lengthy discussion on the value of blue-collar trades versus academic degrees (“How many philosophy PhDs can build himself a bookshelf?”). This shifts the focus away from the central topic of hierarchical corruption and onto class biases, distracting the reader with a related but separate issue.

Straw men – Yes – Explanation: The text refutes the simplified argument that the scandal is the result of just a “few” bad apples, attributing this weak position to opponents like Bishop Tobin to make it easier to knock down: “it is emphatically NOT the result of one “bad apple” or even only a “few” as the hapless “conservative” Bishop Tobin tried to claim on Twitter.”

Whataboutism – Yes – Explanation: The text charges the “conservative” element of the Church with hypocrisy, deflecting from any distinction between “good” and “bad” bishops. For instance, it quotes Steve Skojec: “We’ve got to stop pretending it’s just the progressive element in the Church. The ‘conservatives’ are complicit, too.”

***

Verdict – 95% – This text is a very strong example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to present a balanced report but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, extreme viewpoint and incite a particular course of action. It achieves this by employing a dense and overlapping combination of nearly all the listed propaganda techniques.

The author constructs a stark, black-and-white narrative of good versus evil: the “faithful” laity, priests, and traditionalists are pitted against a monolithic, corrupt, and evil hierarchy described as “wolves” and “enemies.” This narrative is fueled by a constant stream of loaded language, name-calling, and appeals to fear, designed to provoke anger and a sense of emergency.

The text systematically delegitimizes any opposing or nuanced viewpoint by casting doubt on the motives of all bishops, using whataboutism to claim even the “good” ones are complicit, and refuting straw man arguments. It simplifies a complex, multi-faceted institutional crisis down to a single cause (a “homosexualist cabal”), which is a hallmark of propaganda. Finally, it presents its proposed solution—the creation of completely independent, parallel structures—as the only logical and viable option, urging readers to join a growing bandwagon of like-minded individuals. The overwhelming use of these techniques to manipulate emotion and shut down critical thought in favor of a specific agenda firmly places this text in the category of propaganda.
