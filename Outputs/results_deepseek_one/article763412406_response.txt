### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "tyrannical arrest and imprisonment" (labels UK authorities as tyrannical), "Mohammedan cult" (pejorative term for Islam).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" repeated three times; "Why?" repeated 10+ times in Waters' speech.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – "Free Tommy Robinson!" chanted repeatedly.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings of "paedophile rape gangs," "Islamisation," "jihadis who preach murder," and claims the government "betrayed the British people."  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Why is it so easy to jail Tommy Robinson... but so difficult to jail jihadis?" (questions judicial fairness).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "Tens of thousands" (unverified crowd size); minimizes legal basis for Robinson's imprisonment ("alleged contempt of court").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to British identity: "our traditional way of life," "what our country stands for," and Paul Revere reference.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Tyrannical," "betrayed," "enemies of their own people," "monstrous crimes," "mutilated," "public idolatry" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis or Hitler.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "Fantastic crowd!" and "Massive Crowds Gather" imply popular support.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes child rape, terrorism, and justice failures solely to Islam/Islamisation.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are emotionally charged but not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Quotes UKIP leader Gerard Batten, Geert Wilders, and Anne Marie Waters as credible voices.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – "You either submit, or you resist" frames resistance to Islam as the only moral choice.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "We know why" (shuts down critical analysis of claimed Islamist influence).  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The poll about "corrupt Democrat Politician" distracts from the rally’s context (irrelevant to UK event).  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting opponents.

### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Technique Use**: Employs 14/18 identified techniques (e.g., loaded language, fear appeals, bandwagon) to manipulate emotion and bypass rational scrutiny.  
2. **Narrative Framing**: Portrays Tommy Robinson as a martyr for "free speech" while depicting Islam as an existential threat, ignoring legal nuances of his imprisonment.  
3. **Us-vs-Them Dichotomy**: Creates division between "patriotic Brits" and "treacherous elites/Islamists," reinforced by black-and-white rhetoric ("good vs. evil").  
4. **Emotional Manipulation**: Graphic descriptions of crimes (child rape, mutilation) and apocalyptic language ("winter of persecution") incite anger and fear.  
5. **Sourcing Bias**: Exclusively cites far-right figures (Wilders, Batten) and partisan media (Breitbart), omitting counter-perspectives or legal context.  
6. **Call to Action**: Urges resistance against "submission," framing support for Robinson as a moral imperative.  

**Conclusion**: The text meets propaganda criteria by distorting reality, exploiting tribal identities, and advocating ideological action through emotional coercion rather than evidence-based discourse. The 10% uncertainty reflects the *potential* for genuine advocacy, but the overwhelming use of manipulative techniques confirms its propagandistic intent.
