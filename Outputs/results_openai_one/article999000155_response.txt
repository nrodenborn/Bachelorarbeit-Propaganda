13. **Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation:** The text cites Fox News and Robert Spencer as authorities to support its claims.

14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation:** The text presents only two options: recognizing the jihad threat or abetting jihad, with no middle ground.

**Verdict – 95% – The text exhibits a wide array of propaganda techniques, including name calling, appeal to fear, loaded language, exaggeration, black & white fallacy, and more. It frames the subject (Sinema and the Left) in a highly negative, emotionally charged, and simplistic manner, while appealing to the reader's patriotism and fear. The repetition of the poll question, use of authority figures, and intentional vagueness further reinforce the propagandistic nature of the text. While not every single technique is present, the overwhelming majority are, making it highly likely (95%) that this text is propaganda.**
