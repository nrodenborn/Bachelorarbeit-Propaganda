1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to divorced and remarried Catholics as "public adulterers" and describes the Pope's actions as a "papal travesty."
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that *Amoris Laetitia* (or its interpretation) has been elevated to "magisterial" status is repeated multiple times to emphasize the central point of conflict (e.g., "attempted to make... 'magisterial'", "elevates them to the level of being official teachings", "became the Holy Father’s authentic magisterium", "has by papal fiat been declared magisterial").
3. Slogans – Yes – The title itself, "Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium," acts as a brief, memorable slogan that encapsulates the author's entire argument.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by warning that if no action is taken, Pope Francis might "succeed in tearing the Church in half completely" and that Cardinal Burke's silence could be "more damaging than if you had never raised your voice at all."
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire piece is designed to cast doubt on the Pope's authority and judgment, calling his teaching "erroneous" and his actions an "outrageous overreach of papal authority."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to create a sense of crisis, most notably with the claim that the Pope is on the verge of "tearing the Church in half completely."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a shared Catholic identity and religious duty by invoking "God's Holy Name" and praising Cardinal Burke for "defending His Church."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to sway the reader, such as "public adulterers," "outrageous overreach," "papal travesty," and "ominously clear."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare the Pope or his ideas to any external group hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular; in fact, it frames its position as a necessary dissent against a newly established official teaching.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a complex theological and canonical crisis as having a simple cause: Pope Francis's "papal fiat" and "erroneous teaching," which must be met with a simple solution (a "public correction").
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and clear about its position, its target, and the action it wants to see happen.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author heavily relies on the authority of Cardinal Burke, framing the entire argument around his previous statements and position. For example: "What Cardinal Burke rightly describes as lacking in any magisterial weight whatsoever..."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice for Cardinal Burke: either issue a "public correction" or his silence "may suggest consent," ignoring any other potential actions, responses, or outcomes.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like "do what must now be done" and "The moment, it would seem, has come" are used to present the author's conclusion as inevitable and discourage further debate on the proper course of action.
16. Red herring – No – The article stays highly focused on the central issue and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the audience.
17. Straw men – No – The text directly quotes or accurately paraphrases the positions it is arguing against (e.g., the statements from Cardinal Coccopalmerio and the Pope). It attacks the argument itself, not a misrepresentation of it.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect from its main point by charging the Pope with hypocrisy on other matters. The attack is a direct critique of a specific action.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. While it is based on real events and quotes real people, its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade and incite a specific action through emotional manipulation. The author employs a very high number of propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear (the Church will be torn in half), loaded language ("papal travesty," "public adulterers"), appeal to authority (basing the entire argument on Cardinal Burke's credibility), and a black & white fallacy (the Cardinal must act now or his silence implies consent). The piece constructs a narrative of extreme crisis and urgency, simplifying a complex theological issue into a battle of a righteous Cardinal against a Pope's "erroneous teaching." This deliberate framing, designed to provoke an emotional response and pressure a public figure, moves the text from being a simple opinion piece to a work of propaganda.
