Based on the provided definitions and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "predictable performance" (describing Horowitz/Wray's testimony), "deep state plot" (describing efforts against Trump).
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The term "bias" is repeated throughout, especially emphasized with "textbook definition of bias".
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "textbook definition of bias" is used as a memorable phrase summarizing the accusation against Comey/FBI.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The "deep state plot to 'stop' Trump" implies a dangerous, undemocratic conspiracy that nearly succeeded, instilling fear about hidden enemies.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Repeatedly questions the thoroughness/objectivity of investigations (e.g., Horowitz "failed to reveal any details", "why did we not see it until last Thursday?", "false information", "altered key witness reports", "How did Comey see the report before it came out?").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "massive report" (exaggeration), "solved none of the lingering mysteries" (minimizes the report's findings/scope), "deep state plot" (exaggerates the nature of opposition).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – The "deep state plot to 'stop' Trump" frames the events as an attack on a democratically elected president and, by extension, the will of the American people.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "predictable performance", "lingering mysteries", "devastating exchange", "deep state plot", "targeted by 'unfounded personal attacks'", "unilateral announcement", "concealed", "false information", "altered key witness reports". These phrases evoke strong negative emotions.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler, Nazis, or other universally hated groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text does not explicitly appeal to the popularity of an idea to persuade.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes the complex investigations and hearings primarily to a "deep state plot to 'stop' Trump", ignoring other potential factors or motivations.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Horowitz's responses like "I’ll have to get back to you on that", "I can’t answer that", "not sure", "would have to ask", and the lack of named officials ("two FBI agents and one lawyer") create vagueness and confusion.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Uses quotes and statements from Rep. Gowdy, Rep. Jordan, Rep. King, Rep. Meadows, Rep. Issa, and Rep. Goodlatte to validate criticisms and claims about the FBI/DOJ actions.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as a binary: either there was deliberate, politically motivated bias ("textbook definition of bias", "deep state plot") or none at all (Democrats echoing "no bias"), ignoring potential nuance or degrees of influence.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "textbook definition of bias" is used by Gowdy (and echoed) to definitively label Comey's actions and shut down further discussion about the nature or extent of the bias.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Discussing President Obama's communications with Clinton on her email server ("13 who had done so", volume, classification status) distracts from the core investigation into bias in the Trump-Russia probe.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Attributes arguments to Democrats/IG report defenders that aren't explicitly stated, like implying they accused the AG of "softening" the report, solely to contrast it with Comey's actions ("When the reality is it was Jim Comey who softened...").
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Deflecting criticism of potential bias in the Trump-Russia probe by extensively focusing on perceived flaws and bias in the handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation (e.g., Comey's actions, Obama communications, Strzok/Page involvement in both).

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits a strong concentration of propaganda techniques (14 out of 18 identified). It selectively presents information, heavily uses loaded language and emotionally charged terms ("deep state plot," "devastating exchange"), employs fallacies (black/white, straw man, whataboutism), creates doubt about official investigations, and frames events around a singular, sinister narrative of politically motivated bias against Trump ("textbook definition of bias"). While it reports on actual testimony and quotes, the presentation is heavily slanted to promote a specific interpretation: that the FBI/DOJ investigations were tainted by an anti-Trump bias bordering on conspiracy. The omission of context (like the IG report's specific findings of *no* impact on investigative decisions despite finding bias) and the reliance on techniques designed to persuade emotionally and discredit opposing views indicate a propagandistic purpose. The 30% uncertainty acknowledges the basis in real events (hearings, report) but recognizes the overwhelming use of manipulative framing.
