### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 70% – Explanation:** The text exhibits significant propaganda techniques (e.g., loaded language, whataboutism, bandwagon, minimization, thought-terminating clichés) to manipulate perception. It frames Clinton defensively by downplaying his accountability, redirecting blame to media/Trump, and leveraging emotional language to paint Lewinsky as a victim while dismissing Clinton’s actions as outdated. Patterson’s comparisons to JFK/LBJ and Clinton’s appeal to public support further skew the narrative. However, it includes factual elements (e.g., Lewinsky’s essay, Clinton’s debt), preventing it from being purely propaganda. The biased framing and multiple techniques suggest a high likelihood (70%) of propagandistic intent, primarily to rehabilitate Clinton’s image amid criticism.
