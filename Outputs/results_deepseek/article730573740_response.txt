Here is the analysis of the propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "atrocity" (used to describe blessing homosexual couples).
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – The core message is stated clearly but not repeatedly hammered.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warning of "suicidal modernization", "chaotic conditions", and a situation "like the one before the Reformation" instills fear about the consequences of modernizing changes.
5.  **Doubt** – **No** – The text primarily asserts positions rather than directly questioning the credibility of specific opponents (beyond theological disagreement).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "atrocity", "suicidal modernization", "chaotic conditions" are strong, potentially exaggerated terms for theological disagreement and pastoral adaptation.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals strongly to Catholic identity and loyalty to traditional Church doctrine ("Magisterium", "Truth of God", "the way Christ Himself willed it", "unite the Church").
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Atrocity", "suicidal modernization", "submissive change", "total depravity", "chaotic conditions" are emotionally charged and carry strong negative connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Popularity is not invoked as a reason to accept the position.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The arguments presented are complex theological ones about doctrine and grace, not overly simplistic causal claims.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The cardinal's positions, while complex theologically, are stated clearly and directly (e.g., blessing homosexuals is an atrocity, one Magisterium, sacraments must be as Christ willed, those in mortal sin cannot receive communion).
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cardinal Müller's former position as "former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith" is highlighted, lending weight to his statements. References to John Paul II's "Veritatis Splendor", Christ's institution of sacraments, and the Magisterium are appeals to religious authority.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents stark choices: adherence to traditional doctrine/Magisterium leads to unity and truth vs. adaptation/modernization leads to "suicidal modernization", "chaotic conditions", and potential schism ("like the one before the Reformation"). Implies only one "orthodox way" to interpret Amoris Laetitia.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – While using definitive theological terms (e.g., "Magisterium", "mortal sin", "orthodox way"), these are part of the argument structure, not simple clichés used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The discussion stays focused on the theological issues of blessing homosexual unions, Church modernization, and interpreting Amoris Laetitia. Criticizing Luther is contextual within the discussion of morality and grace.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The arguments against blessing homosexual unions and against separating doctrine from morality are presented directly as positions held by others (e.g., German bishops, proponents of "situation ethics"), not misrepresented weaker versions.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not charge specific opponents with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

**Verdict – 40% –** The text exhibits several propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy), primarily through Cardinal Müller's quoted language and the framing of his opposition to certain Church developments. These techniques are used to strongly advocate a specific traditionalist viewpoint within the Catholic Church and discredit opposing views. However, the text also reports on a specific event (a conference talk), provides context through references to encyclicals and other figures (Archbishop Zvolenský, Professor Melina), and focuses on complex theological arguments grounded in specific Church doctrines. While clearly biased and employing persuasive techniques common in advocacy, the core content revolves around substantive, if contested, religious positions and interpretations rather than solely relying on manipulative emotional appeals or misinformation. It functions more as partisan religious advocacy reporting than pure propaganda.
