1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents as “Never-Trumpers” and refers to the Democratic Party as the “Party of Pelosi” to create a negative association.

2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the old Republican party is gone forever is repeated multiple times with phrases like “is history,” “It’s not coming back,” “no restoration is in the cards,” “It is over,” and “There will be no turning back.”

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate ideas, such as “New World Order” and “crusades for democracy” to label the policies it is attacking. The title itself, “The Never-Trumpers Are Never Coming Back,” functions as a slogan.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by describing negative outcomes of past policies, such as creating a “humanitarian crisis” in Yemen and a “second Cold War.” It also evokes fear of demographic change by stating, “Europe is afraid of Africa and the Middle East reaching the Danube.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively questions the credibility of the old Republican establishment with rhetorical questions like, “Why are the people responsible for these wars still being listened to, rather than confessing their sins at second-thoughts conferences?”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by stating, “The world was ablaze with tribalism,” a dramatic overstatement. It minimizes the complexity of geopolitical events by attributing them to single causes.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the debate around American interests, criticizing policies that led to the rise of a “geo-strategic rival” (China) and praising a “defense second to none.”

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as “hubristic drive,” “historic blunders,” “malevolent power,” “thieves our technology,” and “bleeding southern border.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to Hitler or Nazis to discredit them.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that its viewpoint is part of a popular, rising global movement, describing a “spreading and desperate desire of peoples everywhere to preserve who and what they are” and aligning Trump with this inevitable trend.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents simple causes for highly complex events. For example, it claims the rise of China as a manufacturing power is the direct “Result” of U.S. elites opening markets, ignoring many other economic factors.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s points are direct and forcefully clear. The text does not use vague or obscure language to confuse the audience; its aim is to persuade through clarity, however biased.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites “statesmen like George Kennan” to lend credibility to its argument against NATO expansion.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: the failed Republican party of the past (Bush, McCain) and the new, successful party of Trump. It allows for no middle ground or alternative conservative viewpoints.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses short, declarative statements like “It is over” and “There will be no turning back” to present a conclusion as an indisputable fact, discouraging further discussion or critical thought.

16. Red herring – No – While the arguments are one-sided, they are all marshalled to support the central thesis that the old GOP has failed and been replaced. No irrelevant topics are introduced to distract from this main point.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text characterizes “Never-Trumpers” as simply wanting a “restoration” of the Bush-era party and its specific failed policies. This refutes a simplified, absolute position that opponents may not actually hold, ignoring more nuanced criticisms of Trump.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges the old Republican establishment with hypocrisy, asking, “And where are the Republicans responsible for building up this potentially malevolent power that thieves our technology? Talking of building a Reagan-like Navy to contain the mammoth they nourished.”

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or present a balanced argument, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly polarized viewpoint by delegitimizing an opposing faction. It systematically employs a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. The piece constructs a simple “us vs. them” narrative (Trump/grass roots vs. Never-Trump/elites), uses emotionally loaded language and appeals to fear to bypass rational analysis, and relies heavily on causal oversimplification and the black & white fallacy to rewrite recent history into a simple story of failure and redemption. Furthermore, it actively works to shut down dissent through name-calling, casting doubt, and using thought-terminating clichés. The sheer density and combination of these techniques indicate that the article is crafted as a persuasive polemic rather than a reasoned political analysis.
