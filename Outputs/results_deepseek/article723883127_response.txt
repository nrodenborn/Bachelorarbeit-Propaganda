Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "crazy" (referring to the Pope/Church officials), "shocking", "astonishing".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – "shock"/"shocking" (used 4 times), "calumny" (used twice, quoted from Pope).
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases designed for rallying are used.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Implies the Church is attacking victims instead of abusers, suggesting victims remain unprotected and the powerful are dangerous ("This obviously does not look good... attacking the victims instead of actually going after the abusers").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explicitly questions the Pope's credibility and sincerity ("his plea for forgiveness is empty", "Nothing has changed", "Pope Francis is now attacking the credibility", "does not look good").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "most notorious pedophile" (exaggeration for emphasis), "slew of minors" (exaggeration for impact). Minimization is not prominent.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No appeal to patriotism or group identity beyond the inherent conflict between Church and victims.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Shock!", "Attacking", "shocking move", "defending a bishop who victims have accused", "shocking comments", "notorious pedophile", "astonishing", "cost the Catholic Church its credibility", "drew shock", "immediate rebuke", "disgust", "covering up", "crazy", "empty", "attacking the victims".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No association with a hated group like Nazis to discredit the idea.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Mentions the shock of Chileans, rebuke from victims/advocates, and credible findings by Vatican/judge to imply the Pope's view is unpopular and wrong ("drew shock from Chileans and immediate rebuke from victims and their advocates", "accusers were deemed credible enough by the Vatican", "Chilean judge also found the victims to be credible").
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The text presents a complex situation (abuse, cover-up, Pope's statement) without attributing it to a single, overly simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and accusatory, not vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites the credibility granted by the Vatican and a Chilean judge to the victims to counter the Pope ("accusers were deemed credible enough by the Vatican", "Chilean judge also found the victims to be credible").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the situation as the Pope either attacking victims or going after abusers ("they are now apparently engaging in attacking the victims instead of actually going after the abusers").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Nothing has changed" (used by Juan Carlos Cruz and implicitly endorsed by the text) shuts down consideration that the Pope's actions might have complex motivations or context.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on the Pope's comments, the victims' accusations, and the Church's response to the abuse scandal.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – The text frames the Pope's demand for proof regarding Bishop Barros's complicity as an attack on the victims' credibility in general and a defense of the cover-up ("Pope Francis is now attacking the credibility of child sex abuse victims", "defending a bishop", "attacking the victims"). The Pope specifically questioned the accusation against Barros, not the victims of Karadima.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not accuse the Pope or Church of hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated wrongs.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs numerous propaganda techniques (Loaded Language, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Bandwagon, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-terminating clichés, Straw Men, Name Calling, Exaggeration) to present a one-sided, emotionally charged narrative. The language is consistently inflammatory ("Shock!", "attacking", "crazy", "empty") and selectively presents facts (emphasizing the Pope's "calumny" remark and victim reactions while downplaying his request for proof or the complexity of the Barros accusation). The primary goal appears to be to discredit Pope Francis and the Catholic Church by portraying his specific statement as a malicious, broad attack on abuse victims, rather than fostering a nuanced discussion about the specific allegation against Bishop Barros. The headline is particularly sensational and misleading, framing a demand for evidence regarding one bishop as an "open attack" on victims. While based on real events and quotes, the framing, emphasis, and language choices are designed to provoke strong negative emotion and a specific, condemnatory interpretation, hallmarks of propaganda.
