1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "killer cop" (referring to Amber Guyger), "homicidal cop".  
   *Explanation: Insulting labels are used to attack the officer.*

2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" (repeated 3 times in the poll).  
   *Explanation: The same phrase is duplicated verbatim to emphasize the poll.*

3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases are used repetitively as slogans.  

4. **Appeal to fear** – **No** – The text criticizes police actions but does not instill fear about alternatives.  

5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "why on earth would they execute a search warrant...?"; "Guyger’s story... was simply not true".  
   *Explanation: Questions the credibility of the police narrative.*

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "tiny bit of marijuana" (minimizing the drug find); "killer cop" (exaggerating Guyger’s intent).  
   *Explanation: Downplays the marijuana discovery while amplifying the officer’s culpability.*

7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  

8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "smear", "assassination attempt", "killer cop", "homicidal cop", "irreprehensible".

10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeals to popularity.  

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The text cites multiple factors (e.g., witness accounts, door mechanics) rather than oversimplifying.  

12. **Obfuscation** – **No** – Language is direct and accusatory, not vague.  

13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Quotes attorneys (Merritt, Washington) to validate claims.  
   *Explanation: Uses legal experts to bolster criticism of police.*

14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Acknowledges complexities (e.g., witness testimonies vs. police claims).  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases discouraging critical thought.  

16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The Nikki Haley poll is irrelevant to the Botham Jean story.  
   *Explanation: Distracts with an unrelated political question.*

17. **Straw men** – **No** – Accurately represents police claims (e.g., Guyger’s "wrong apartment" story) before refuting them.  

18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Focuses on the incident without accusing opponents of hypocrisy.

### Verdict – 65% – Detailed Explanation:
The text exhibits **multiple propaganda techniques** (6/18), including **name-calling**, **loaded language**, and **exaggeration/minimization** to vilify the Dallas Police and portray Botham Jean as an innocent victim of a "smear campaign." It leverages **emotional language** ("assassination attempt," "killer cop") and **doubt** to undermine the official narrative while citing **authorities** (attorneys) for credibility. The **irrelevant Nikki Haley poll** acts as a red herring, diluting focus. However, it also presents **factual details** (e.g., door mechanics, witness accounts) and avoids overt fallacies like oversimplification or false dichotomies. While the piece clearly advocates against police actions—using biased framing—it is not purely propaganda due to its reliance on verifiable claims. The 65% likelihood reflects strong propagandistic *techniques* but stops short of being entirely manipulative, as it raises legitimate questions about police transparency.
