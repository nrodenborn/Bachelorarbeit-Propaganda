### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – Explanation: "Campus Commie," "leftist loon," "Angry leftist," and "hysterical profanity-laden melodramatic hissy fits" are insulting labels attacking the subject.  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Explanation: The phrase "normalizing and enabling Nazis" is repeated verbatim, and the incident is emphasized with duplicated phrasing (e.g., "Watch...").  
3. **Slogans** – No – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrase (e.g., "Build the Wall") is used; the text relies on descriptive language instead.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Explanation: Accusing Republicans of "normalizing and enabling Nazis" instills fear about the consequences of supporting political figures.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Explanation: "By the way…where are her pants?" implicitly questions the subject's credibility/character without evidence.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Explanation: "Hysterical," "melodramatic hissy fits," "trigger these people," and "loon" exaggerate the subject's actions; the event is minimized as a trivial "fit."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – Explanation: No appeal to patriotism or national identity; the focus is on partisan conflict.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Explanation: "Commie," "hissy fit," "trigger," "loon," and "enabling Nazis" use emotionally charged, stereotypical language.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – Explanation: Accusing Republicans of "enabling Nazis" links their actions to Hitler/Nazism to provoke disapproval.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Explanation: No suggestion that the idea (e.g., opposing Republicans) is popular or endorsed by others.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Explanation: Claims supporting Rick Scott/Ron DeSantis directly causes "enabling Nazis," oversimplifying complex political dynamics.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Explanation: Language is direct and inflammatory, not deliberately vague or confusing.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Explanation: No authority figure is cited to validate claims; the source is a tweet from Kyle Morris, who is not presented as an authority.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Explanation: Implies that supporting DeSantis/Scott inherently equals "enabling Nazis," ignoring nuance or alternatives.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – Explanation: No phrases (e.g., "it is what it is") are used to shut down critical analysis.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Explanation: "Where are her pants?" distracts from the main incident with irrelevant mockery.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Explanation: The subject’s argument ("normalizing Nazis") is quoted directly, not misrepresented.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Explanation: No accusation of hypocrisy (e.g., "What about X group?").

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely propaganda due to its systematic use of manipulative techniques. It employs **name-calling** and **loaded language** ("Commie," "loon") to dehumanize the subject, **repetition** and **appeal to fear** ("enabling Nazis") to amplify threat perception, and **exaggeration** ("hysterical hissy fits") to distort the event. The **reduction ad Hitlerum** and **black & white fallacy** frames opposition as inherently evil, while the **red herring** ("where are her pants?") diverts attention. It targets a specific group (leftists) using emotionally charged, one-sided language to provoke outrage and reinforce partisan divisions, with minimal factual reporting. The tweet’s sensationalized tone and lack of balanced context further indicate propaganda intent. The 10% uncertainty stems from the inclusion of a factual element (the beverage-pouring incident), though it is heavily embellished.
