### Verdict
**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits extensive use of propaganda techniques: It employs inflammatory labels ("jihadis"), fear-mongering ("mass school shootings"), causal oversimplification (blaming one DA for systemic issues), minimization of due process ("Nothing!"), and red herrings (distracting with Trump/Sessions criticism). The loaded language frames Muslims as inherent threats while ignoring evidence standards. Though structured as news, its selective framing, emotional manipulation, and consistent deployment of multiple propaganda devices indicate a clear intent to shape perception rather than inform objectively. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of factual elements (arrest details, quotes), but these are weaponized within a manipulative narrative.
