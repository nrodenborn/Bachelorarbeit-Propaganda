Name calling – Yes – The text quotes President Trump's description of the migrant caravan as an impending “invasion,” which is an insulting label that frames the migrants as hostile attackers.

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly mentions the installation of “razor wire” and “barricades” to reinforce the image of a militarized border. The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is also repeated three times consecutively.

Slogans – Yes – The text refers to the military deployment as “Operation Faithful Patriot,” a memorable phrase designed to evoke feelings of patriotism and righteousness.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text builds fear by detailing the massive military response, including “5,200 troops,” “drones, helicopters with night-vision capabilities,” and “razor wire.” This, combined with terms like “potential clashes” and Trump’s “invasion” quote, is meant to instill fear of the approaching migrants.

Doubt – No – The text does not actively question the credibility of any person or group; it primarily reports on actions and quotes official sources to support its narrative.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text quotes President Trump's description of the caravan as an “invasion,” which exaggerates the threat posed by the group of migrants. The detailed listing of a large-scale military deployment against them further amplifies this exaggeration.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text uses the name of the military mission, “Operation Faithful Patriot,” to appeal to patriotism. It also includes a tweet featuring the US flag emoji: "US Marines instal wire along the primary border wall... 🇺🇸".

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to frame the event, such as the migrants being a “perceived threat” that the military must “thwart,” and describing them as an “impending migrant ‘invasion.’”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular and that the reader should adopt it for that reason. It focuses on the actions of authorities rather than popular opinion.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not attempt to explain the complex causes of the migration; it focuses solely on the response at the border.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – While the text uses some official jargon like “port hardening infrastructure equipment,” the overall message is clear and direct, not intentionally vague or confusing.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites official sources like “US Customs and Border Protection (CBP),” the “Department of Defense,” and President Trump to lend authority and credibility to the narrative of a necessary military buildup.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The unrelated poll about Jim Acosta presents a false dichotomy: “Yes, he should have gotten it back” versus “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass,” ignoring any nuance. The main article also implicitly frames the situation as a choice between a military blockade and a dangerous "invasion," ignoring other policy options.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down critical thought.

Red herring – Yes – The text inserts a completely irrelevant poll and section about reporter Jim Acosta's press pass. This has no connection to the migrant caravan and serves only to distract the reader from the main topic.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an opponent's argument. It focuses on presenting its own narrative.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any opponent of hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It does not present a balanced or objective view of the situation. Instead, it constructs a one-sided narrative of a dangerous "invasion" that justifies a massive military response. This is achieved through a combination of powerful propaganda techniques, including a strong Appeal to Fear (by detailing military hardware and using threatening language), Loaded Language ("invasion," "thwart"), Name Calling (quoting Trump's "invasion" label), Exaggeration (framing a group of migrants as a military threat), and Flag-Waving ("Operation Faithful Patriot"). Furthermore, the blatant use of a Red Herring (the irrelevant Jim Acosta poll) is a deliberate tactic to distract the audience. The article selectively presents information that supports its fear-based narrative while omitting crucial context, such as the reasons for the migration or the legal right to seek asylum.
