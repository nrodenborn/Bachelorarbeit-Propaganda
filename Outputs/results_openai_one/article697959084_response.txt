**Verdict – 90% –**  
The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, obfuscation, appeal to authority, and the black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to undermine trust in the official narrative and authorities, create emotional impact, and persuade the reader to believe in a cover-up without providing conclusive evidence. The repeated use of emotionally charged language and vague accusations, as well as the reliance on questionable authorities, strongly suggest the text is propaganda. However, the lack of some techniques (such as name calling, slogans, or bandwagon) and the presence of some factual reporting (eyewitness account) prevent a 100% certainty. Thus, there is a very high likelihood (90%) that the text is propaganda.
