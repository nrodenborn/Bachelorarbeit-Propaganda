1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses labels like "criminal aliens," "immigration violators," and "offenders" to attack the subjects of the arrests and frame them negatively. For example: "arrested 22 criminal aliens and immigration violators".

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the criminality of the arrested individuals and the idea that ICE's actions ensure public safety. The term "criminal aliens" and the concept of removing them to make communities "safer" are mentioned multiple times, including in the director's quote.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable, or catchy phrases that function as slogans.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear against "sanctuary policies" by linking them to danger. It explicitly states these policies "put our communities at risk" and highlights that individuals convicted of serious crimes like sexual assault and kidnapping were released because of them.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and judgment of local law enforcement in Cook County by stating they "failed to honor an immigration detainer" and describing their policies as "reckless."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the impact of the operation by calling it an "invaluable community service." It also minimizes the non-criminal context of the individuals by, for example, mentioning one is a DACA recipient only to immediately pivot to his criminal conviction, thereby downplaying the significance of his DACA status.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing its mission as part of the "ongoing efforts to protect the nation, uphold public safety, and protect the integrity of our immigration laws and border controls."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged terms to influence the audience. Phrases like "criminal aliens," "reckless sanctuary policies," "fugitive immigration violators," and the listing of violent crimes are chosen to evoke fear and anger.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparison to Hitler or other groups widely hated by the audience.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not claim that its position is popular or that "everyone is doing it." It instead positions itself as being in opposition to local policies.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple solution to the complex problem of public safety. The quote, "By removing criminal aliens from the streets, our ICE officers provide an invaluable community service by improving public safety," suggests that arresting this small group of people is a primary cause of improved safety.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is intentionally specific, not vague. It provides exact numbers, locations, nationalities, and lists of criminal convictions to support its point.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text is an official press release from a government agency (ICE) and uses a quote from its own "field office director of ERO Chicago," Ricardo Wong, as an authoritative voice to validate its claims and narrative.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: support ICE's enforcement for public safety, or support "reckless sanctuary policies" that "put our communities at risk." This creates a false dichotomy that ignores any other potential approaches or nuances.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases such as "uphold public safety" and "protect the nation" are used as broad, positive justifications that are difficult to argue against, thus discouraging critical thought about the specific methods being used.

16. Red herring – No – The text stays highly focused on the topic of the enforcement action and its justification. It does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the reader.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a distorted version of "sanctuary policies." It presents them solely as "reckless" policies that release dangerous criminals, ignoring the actual, more complex arguments for them (e.g., building community trust, conserving local police resources).

18. Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes an opponent's policy directly but does not use it to deflect criticism or accuse the opponent of hypocrisy in response to a charge.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a press release, a form of public relations which often employs propaganda. Its primary purpose is not merely to inform, but to persuade the public that the agency’s actions are necessary and beneficial, while simultaneously undermining opposing policies. This is achieved through the heavy and deliberate use of numerous propaganda techniques.

The text systematically employs loaded language ("criminal aliens") and name-calling to dehumanize the subjects and frame them as a threat. It uses an appeal to fear by explicitly linking "sanctuary policies" to a risk to the community, reinforced by a list of serious crimes. It creates a black & white fallacy, positioning ICE as the sole purveyor of public safety against "reckless" local governments. The argument is a causal oversimplification, suggesting that arresting 22 people provides an "invaluable community service" that solves the complex issue of public safety. It also uses its own authority (a quote from its director) to validate its message and appeals to patriotism ("protect the nation") to create an uncritical, positive association with its actions. While based on factual events (the arrests), the selection of information, the framing of the narrative, and the persuasive language are all hallmarks of a sophisticated propaganda piece designed to shape public opinion.
