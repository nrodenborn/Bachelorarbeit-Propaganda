Name calling – Yes – The author uses insulting labels like "social justice crybullying" and "Columbia snowflakes" to attack the students who stopped the performance.

Repetition – No – While the text has a consistent theme, it does not repeat the same specific message or phrase over and over.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses the brief, memorable phrase "the Left killed comedy" to encapsulate its main argument.

Appeal to fear – No – The text expresses criticism and ridicule but does not attempt to instill fear in the audience about the consequences of alternative viewpoints.

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and judgment of the student organizers by referring to them as "Columbia snowflakes" and suggesting they wouldn't be able to handle comedians like Richard Pryor.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration with the statement "the Left killed comedy" and sarcastically exaggerates the students' reaction by saying a similar joke "is now a hate crime."

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like "crybullying," "snowflakes," "Comrades," and "thought crimes" to evoke a negative emotional response towards the students.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparison to Hitler or Nazism.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is correct because it is popular; in fact, it frames its viewpoint as being in opposition to the popular one at the university.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's language is direct and their position is very clear, not intentionally vague or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text lists Nimesh Patel's credentials (SNL writer, Emmy nomination, opening for Chris Rock) to establish his authority as a comedian, implying the students were wrong to challenge him.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy: either one accepts Patel's jokes as they are ("the real world"), or one is an overly sensitive "snowflake" who is killing comedy. It ignores any nuanced middle ground.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "the Left killed comedy" is a sweeping, simplistic statement that discourages nuanced discussion about the evolution of comedy and the specific incident.

Red herring – Yes – The reference to a "Sammy Davis Jr joke" is used to distract from the specifics of Patel's joke and the students' reaction by introducing a historical parallel that is not directly relevant to the current conflict.

Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes the students for being overly sensitive but does not accuse them of hypocrisy by pointing to other actions or beliefs.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform the reader about an event, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint of the Columbia students and "the Left" in general. This is achieved through a dense and deliberate application of numerous propaganda techniques. The text employs emotionally charged and derogatory language (Name Calling, Loaded Language) such as "crybullying" and "snowflakes" to ridicule the subject. It simplifies a complex cultural issue into a slogan and a case of Causal Oversimplification ("the Left killed comedy"). It creates a false Black & White Fallacy where the only options are to accept the comedian's "real world" or be an oversensitive student. Furthermore, it uses a Straw Man argument by misrepresenting the students' position as being against all edgy comedy, and it appeals to authority by listing Patel's credentials to invalidate the students' complaints. The sheer volume and combination of these techniques show a clear intent to manipulate the reader's perception and emotions rather than to present a balanced or good-faith argument.
