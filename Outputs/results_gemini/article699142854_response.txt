Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the Iranian government as a “murderous regime in Tehran.”
2.  Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes Iran's aggression and hostility, listing its “rap sheet of aggression,” “crimes and acts of war,” “sponsorship of terrorism,” and “aggression against its neighbors” to reinforce the central message of Iran as a constant threat.
3.  Slogans – No – The text does not use brief and memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text builds its argument on the threat of Iran, mentioning its potential to “acquiring nuclear weapons,” its “hegemonic rise,” and how the regime and its program will “remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.”
5.  Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the Obama administration’s policy, calling its foundations “mendacious assumptions,” and casts doubt on the motives of political figures like Senator Corker, suggesting he might act “out of spite.”
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by claiming Obama “backed the murderous regime in Tehran” during the Green Revolution, which simplifies a complex foreign policy response into active support. It also minimizes the complexities of the nuclear deal by framing it as simply giving Iran a “free pass.”
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The article frames the entire issue around American patriotism and security, citing Iran’s “aggression against America,” its “crimes and acts of war against America,” and the threat to “US national security and interests.”
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as describing the Iranian government as “murderous” and “authoritarian theocrats,” Obama’s policy assumptions as “mendacious,” and a political dispute as an “ugly public fight.”
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with a group like Nazis or a similarly hated entity to discredit it.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is good because it is popular. In fact, it argues against the consensus of the Europeans, Chinese, Russians, and many on Capitol Hill.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests that leading Democrats might oppose changes to the deal simply because they are “opponents of the Trump administration,” oversimplifying their potential motivations and ignoring other possible policy-based reasons.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and its arguments, while biased, are clearly stated. It does not use intentionally obscure expressions to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – No – While it discusses President Trump’s actions and authority, it does not use his or any other authority’s support as the primary evidence for its claims. Instead, it builds its own case.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a choice for European nations as one between “conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran,” ignoring other potential diplomatic or economic arrangements. It also frames the overarching policy choice as one between Obama’s flawed approach and Trump’s “reality-based” one.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common, simplistic phrases designed to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The discussion of the “ugly public fight” between Trump and Corker is used to attribute Corker’s potential opposition to personal “spite,” distracting from any substantive policy-based reasons he might have for his position on the Iran deal.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text claims that for the past two years, “US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama’s nuclear pact.” This misrepresents the broader debate, which also included Iran’s regional aggression and missile program, making the opposing view seem weaker and more narrow than it was.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes opponents directly but does not use the technique of deflecting criticism by accusing the opponent of hypocrisy on another issue.

***

Verdict – 90% – The text is an opinion piece that heavily utilizes propaganda techniques to advocate for a specific, hawkish political viewpoint. Its primary purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the reader. This is evident through its consistent use of emotional manipulation and logical fallacies.

The article employs loaded language ("murderous regime," "mendacious assumptions") and name-calling to create a strong negative emotional response toward Iran and political opponents. It relies heavily on an appeal to fear, framing Iran as an existential menace to justify its proposed policies. It also uses flag-waving to align its argument with American patriotism and national security.

Furthermore, the text constructs a biased narrative using logical fallacies. It creates a straw man of the previous discourse on Iran to make its own argument seem more insightful. It uses a black & white fallacy to present limited, extreme options (e.g., business with the US vs. business with Iran). It also engages in causal oversimplification and introduces red herrings to cast doubt on the motives of political opponents, attributing their potential actions to "spite" or partisanship rather than legitimate policy differences.

While presented as analysis, the overwhelming presence of these techniques, the one-sided framing, and the clear persuasive goal make it a strong example of propaganda.
