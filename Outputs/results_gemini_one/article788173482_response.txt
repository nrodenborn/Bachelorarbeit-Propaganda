Here is the analysis of the text based on the provided propaganda techniques:

Name calling – Yes – The text refers to FBI employees as "disgraced ex-FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page" and to political opponents as "frauds."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly refers to the investigation as a "hoax" and a "conspiracy theory." For example, "the FBI investigation of the conspiracy theory began as a 'hoax'" and later, "It’s a hoax, beyond a witch hunt."

Slogans – Yes – The phrase "Deep State" is used as a brief and memorable phrase to label the supposed antagonists. Example: "How else does one fight back against the nameless, faceless bureaucrats of the Deep State..."

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear of a secret group trying to subvert the government. Example: "...nameless, faceless bureaucrats of the Deep State who hide behind anonymity to undermine the duly elected 45th president of the United States."

Doubt – Yes – The text consistently questions the credibility and motives of the FBI and Democratic lawmakers. Example: It claims the Democrats' letter is an "attempt to usurp the powers vested in the president" and that they "lie about the nature of the broad-based request."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text quotes President Trump exaggerating the potential impact of his action, stating that exposing the "hoax" could be one of the “crowning achievements” of his presidency.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by labeling the alleged conspiracy as a "shameful un-American plot."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language. Example: "There is so much leftist dirt to uncover."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text attacks opponents but does not compare them to Nazis or similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text implies growing support for the president's action to create a sense of momentum. Example: "At the request of a number of committees of Congress..."

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex Russia investigation to a single, simple cause. Example: It is described merely as a "shameful un-American plot to rig the 2016 election and undermine his successor."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses the term "Deep State" to refer to a vague and undefined enemy. Example: "...there are still thousands of unaccountable Deep State operatives in the Trump administration..."

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the support of an authority figure as evidence. Example: "The chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Devin Nunes (R -Calif.), reportedly hailed Trump’s order..."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a conflict between only two sides: President Trump fighting for transparency versus a corrupt "Deep State" plotting against him, ignoring any other possibilities or nuances. Example: "How else does one fight back against the nameless, faceless bureaucrats of the Deep State...?"

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a phrase to discourage critical thought about the consequences of an action. Example: "Make the documents public and let the chips fall where they may."

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces irrelevant material to distract and discredit individuals. Example: It repeatedly mentions that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were "having an extramarital affair," a detail irrelevant to the official investigation but useful for character assassination.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified version of its opponents' position. Example: It characterizes the entire Russia probe as the "Left’s electoral collusion conspiracy theory" and "baseless nonsense," making it easy to dismiss without engaging with the actual, more complex findings of the investigation.

Whataboutism – No – The text is focused on attacking one side and does not deflect criticism of President Trump by accusing his opponents of hypocrisy for a similar action.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly polarized worldview. The article employs a vast majority (16 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques, often layering them within the same sentences.

The entire narrative is built on a **black & white fallacy** (Trump vs. the "Deep State") and a **causal oversimplification** (the Russia probe is just a "plot"). It uses emotionally charged and biased language throughout (**loaded language**, **name calling**) to frame one side as heroic and the other as corrupt and unpatriotic (**flag-waving**). The author relies heavily on creating a sense of a hidden enemy (**appeal to fear**, **obfuscation**) and casts **doubt** on the credibility of all opposing figures and institutions.

Logical fallacies like **red herring** (the affair) and **straw men** (mischaracterizing the investigation) are used to dismantle opposing arguments without engaging them honestly. The argument is bolstered by **appeals to authority** and a subtle **bandwagon** effect, while **thought-terminating clichés** are used to shut down nuanced thinking. The sheer density and variety of these techniques indicate a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's perception rather than present a balanced account of events.
