Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack political figures, for example by referring to the former president as “Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah” and calling Hillary Clinton a “known criminal.”

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the exact same poll question three times in a row: “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?”

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – No – The text primarily appeals to anger and a sense of injustice rather than instilling fear in the audience.

Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the credibility and fairness of the justice system and the FBI by contrasting two cases. For example: “The same FBI that gave Hillary Clinton a pass... but would not give the same leniency to Saucier.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the actions of the sailor by stating he “simply took some pictures of his submarine,” downplaying the severity of photographing classified areas of a nuclear submarine.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national identity by framing the issue as a concern for all citizens. For example: “I continue to ask what a lot of Americans continue to ask, why does the known criminal Hillary Clinton remain at large in our country with her corrupt foundation taking in billions, her trashing our Republic...”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the audience, such as “known criminal,” “corrupt foundation,” and “two-tier justice system.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that its viewpoint is widely held in order to persuade the reader. For example: “I continue to ask what a lot of Americans continue to ask...”

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex legal situation. For example: “‘They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton,’ he continued, alleging his life was ruined for political reasons.”

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the support of an authority figure to validate its claims. For example: “President Trump had spoken of his support of Saucier on the campaign trail and blasted the Obama administration's handling of his case.”

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a complex situation as having only two possible outcomes. For example: “‘We’re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there’s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.’” This frames the justice system as either completely fair or corruptly two-tiered, ignoring any nuance.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases or clichés intended to shut down critical thought.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces irrelevant material to distract the audience. The poll, “Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?”, has no direct bearing on the facts of the Saucier lawsuit and serves to distract and attack political opponents.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that was not actually made.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text consistently deflects from the details of Saucier’s case by charging opponents with hypocrisy, primarily focusing on Hillary Clinton. The rhetorical question, “But hey, Hillary is free, right?” exemplifies this technique.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. It is not a neutral report on a lawsuit but a highly biased and persuasive article designed to promote a specific political narrative. The piece employs a multitude of propaganda techniques, most notably Whataboutism, which forms the core of its argument by constantly deflecting from the Saucier case to attack Hillary Clinton. It uses Loaded Language ("known criminal," "corrupt foundation"), Name Calling ("Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah"), and appeals to a Bandwagon fallacy ("what a lot of Americans continue to ask") to create an emotional, partisan response. The inclusion of a repetitive Red Herring poll targeting Democrats and the Black & White Fallacy of a "two-tier justice system" further cement its purpose as a tool for political attack rather than objective journalism. The sheer density and combination of these techniques confirm its propagandistic nature.
