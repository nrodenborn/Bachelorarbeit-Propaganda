**Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as name-calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and whataboutism. These elements suggest a significant likelihood of the text being propaganda, as it aims to shape the reader's perception of U.S. policies towards Iran by using emotionally charged language and questioning the credibility of official statements. However, the presence of detailed arguments and evidence also indicates an attempt to provide a counter-narrative, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood of it being pure propaganda.**
