1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Glenn Greenwald’s opponents as “leftists at Democracy Now!” and uses the dismissive term “Helsinki Hulabaloo” to label the controversy surrounding the Trump-Putin press conference.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – Yes – The headline “Liberals Agree – Trump Tougher on Putin than Obama Was” functions as a brief, memorable phrase that encapsulates the article's entire message.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear in the reader about alternative viewpoints.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text is constructed to cast doubt on the credibility of the "leftwing media" by stating Greenwald "simply cannot understand how the leftwing media keeps getting so riled up at everything that Trump does," questioning their judgment.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline “Liberals Agree” is an exaggeration, as the article only cites one person, Glenn Greenwald, and generalizes his opinion to an entire, diverse political group.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or use patriotic symbols to make its case.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and dismissive words like “riled up,” “Helsinki Hulabaloo,” and “ridiculous” to frame the media’s reaction as hysterical and irrational.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – While the word “fascist” is used in a quote, it is used to describe a leader, not to discredit an opponent's idea by associating it with a hated group.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The headline “Liberals Agree” is an appeal to bandwagon, suggesting that even political opponents are joining this viewpoint, so the reader should too.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text, by quoting Greenwald’s list of policy points, avoids attributing the situation to a single, simple cause.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article’s argument, while biased, is presented in a clear and direct manner.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The entire article’s premise is an appeal to the authority of Glenn Greenwald, who is specifically identified as a “leftwing journalist” to lend credibility to a pro-Trump argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the issue as a simple binary choice: Trump’s policies were “tougher” on Russia, while Obama’s were “more cooperative.” This framing ignores any nuance or complexity in US-Russia relations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “it becomes CLEAR that Trump has obviously been tougher” is used to present the conclusion as an indisputable fact, discouraging further thought or discussion.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation is completely irrelevant to the article's topic of Trump's Russia policy and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the simplified argument that “Trump is some kind of a puppet of Putin,” while ignoring other, more nuanced criticisms of Trump's relationship with Putin, thereby knocking down an easily defeated caricature of the opposition's position.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – To counter the criticism that Trump doesn't criticize Putin, the text pivots by saying, "But he’s also never criticized Benjamin Netanyahu... He’s also never criticized the incredibly repressive leaders of Saudi Arabia." This deflects the original point by charging hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific political viewpoint by using a wide array of manipulative techniques. The entire piece is framed as an Appeal to Authority, using a "leftwing" journalist to validate a conservative talking point. The headline itself employs Exaggeration ("Liberals Agree"), Bandwagon, and a Slogan to immediately frame the argument as settled. The body of the text uses Loaded Language ("Helsinki Hulabaloo") to dismiss opposing views emotionally, a Black & White Fallacy to simplify a complex foreign policy issue into a simple Trump vs. Obama comparison, and a blatant Red Herring (the Kavanaugh poll) to distract and capture user data. The core argument it presents, from Greenwald, relies on Whataboutism and refutes a Straw Man version of the criticism against Trump. The sheer number and strategic deployment of these techniques confirm the text's nature as propaganda designed to reinforce a narrative and discourage critical analysis.
