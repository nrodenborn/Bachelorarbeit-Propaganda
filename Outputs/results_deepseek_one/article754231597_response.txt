### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:
1. **Name calling** – No  
   *Explanation*: No insulting labels are used against subjects (e.g., Ebola is described clinically, not with pejorative terms).  
2. **Repetition** – No  
   *Explanation*: Key phrases (e.g., "outbreak") are not repeated excessively for emphasis.  
3. **Slogans** – No  
   *Explanation*: No brief, memorable phrases designed to rally support (e.g., no calls to action like "Stop Ebola Now!").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
   *Explanation*: While Ebola’s severity is noted ("deadly virus," "severe bleeding"), the tone is factual, not alarmist. No fear is weaponized against alternatives.  
5. **Doubt** – No  
   *Explanation*: No questioning of credibility (e.g., authorities like WHO or the Congo government are cited neutrally).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No  
   *Explanation*: Statistics (2 confirmed cases, 0 deaths) are reported without embellishment or downplaying.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No  
   *Explanation*: No appeals to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – No  
   *Explanation*: Language is clinical ("hemorrhagic fever," "organ failure") rather than emotionally charged (e.g., "horrific plague" is absent).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *Explanation*: No comparisons to Nazis or other vilified groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No  
    *Explanation*: No appeal to popularity (e.g., "Join global efforts!" is missing).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No  
    *Explanation*: Outbreak causes are not discussed; focus is on response, not origins.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No  
    *Explanation*: Details (location, cases, response steps) are clear and specific.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation*: Dr. Moeti (WHO) is cited to validate response efforts: "WHO will work closely... to support national response." This uses institutional authority as evidence of credibility.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No  
    *Explanation*: No false dilemmas (e.g., "Only WHO can save us").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No  
    *Explanation*: No phrases halting debate (e.g., "Trust the experts" is absent).  
16. **Red herring** – No  
    *Explanation*: No irrelevant distractions; all details relate to the outbreak.  
17. **Straw men** – No  
    *Explanation*: No misrepresented arguments are refuted.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    *Explanation*: No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no comparisons to past failures).

### Verdict – 5% –   
*Explanation*: The text is **overwhelmingly factual and non-propagandistic**. It reports:  
- Objective details (location, cases, sources).  
- Neutral language (e.g., "deadly virus" is clinically accurate).  
- Authorities cited for context (WHO, Congo government), not manipulation.  
The *only minor element* is an **appeal to authority** (WHO’s role), common in credible public health reporting. This does not distort facts or push an agenda.  
**Why 5%?**  
- 95% of the text is purely informational (who, what, when, where).  
- 5% reflects the inherent bias in *any* selective reporting (e.g., highlighting WHO’s involvement without criticizing it). No techniques manipulate emotion or ideology.  
**Conclusion**: This is **standard news reporting**, not propaganda. It aims to inform, not persuade.
