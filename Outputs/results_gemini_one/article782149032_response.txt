Name calling – Yes – The text uses labels like “Jihadi Muslims” and “devout (‘extremist’) Muslims” to attack the subjects of the article.
Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is repeated three times in a row.
Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases intended to be repeated as a slogan.
Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses phrases like “Horrifying Details,” “Deadly NM Islamic Compound,” and “jihad compound” to instill fear. It also suggests a broader threat by claiming law enforcement is engaged in “sharia compliance,” implying a dangerous takeover of the legal system.
Doubt – Yes – The text actively questions the credibility and motives of law enforcement by stating, “They destroyed the compound to cover up both their negligence and what happened there.”
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the motives of law enforcement by claiming, “making Islam look good seems to be the top priority of law enforcement officials,” which is presented without evidence.
Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.
Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words like “Horrifying,” “Deadly,” “Jihadi,” and “starved to almost certain death” to appeal to the reader's emotions.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.
Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea should be adopted because it is popular.
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text claims the simple reason the compound was destroyed was to “cover up both their negligence and what happened there” and to make Islam look good, ignoring other potential complex factors in a law enforcement investigation.
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague; its accusations are direct and clear, even if unsupported.
Appeal to authority – No – The text does not cite an authority figure to support its claims.
Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present a false dichotomy or only two choices as an argument.
Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to discourage critical thought.
Red herring – Yes – The insertion of a poll about Brett Kavanaugh (“Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?”) is completely irrelevant to the topic of the New Mexico compound and serves to distract the reader.
Straw men – No – The text makes direct accusations rather than refuting a mischaracterized argument.
Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge an opponent with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and overt example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to provoke an emotional response of fear, anger, and suspicion. It employs a multitude of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. The use of loaded language and name-calling ("Horrifying," "Jihadi Muslims") frames the event and individuals in a negative light from the very beginning. It then builds a conspiracy narrative by casting doubt on official institutions, making unsubstantiated claims that law enforcement destroyed evidence to "cover up their negligence" and is enforcing "sharia compliance." This is a form of causal oversimplification, attributing complex events to a simple, malicious motive. The inclusion of a completely unrelated red herring poll about Brett Kavanaugh further demonstrates the article's intent to manipulate and distract rather than report. The combination of these techniques shows a deliberate effort to shape the reader's perception and push a specific, emotionally-charged agenda, which is the essence of propaganda.
