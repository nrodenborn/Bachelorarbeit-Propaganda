1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the Democratic Party as the "criminal Democrat Party" and refers to Senator Elizabeth Warren as "Fauxahontas."
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The poll question about the "caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border" is designed to instill fear by framing the migrants as an organized, threatening force ("marching").
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the Senate's integrity by asking, "but will the Senate hold these women to the standard they've set?"
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by labeling the entire Democratic Party as "the criminal Democrat Party" based on an ethics complaint against two of its members.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of national identity by framing the migrant caravan as a threat to the "U.S. border" that may require "military force," and by asking the "good people of Massachusetts" to "do us all a favor" for the implied good of the country.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language such as "criminal Democrat Party," "Fauxahontas," and describing the senators as "so gung ho."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with hated groups like Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea; instead, it attempts to generate opposition.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple cause for the ethics complaint: "Looks like when you are so gung ho to go after someone... it will eventually come back to bite you," implying their actions against Kavanaugh directly and karmically caused this complaint, ignoring other political factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites "The Washington Times" and a "watchdog group" (FACT) and its executive director to lend credibility to its argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll presents only two choices regarding the migrant caravan: "Yes, military force should be used" or "No, keep the military out of it," ignoring many other possible policy options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "it will eventually come back to bite you" is used to shut down further analysis of the situation, presenting it as a simple, inevitable consequence rather than a complex event.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is inserted into an article about a Senate ethics complaint. It is an irrelevant topic designed to distract the reader and provoke an emotional response on a different issue.
17. Straw men – No – The text primarily makes accusations rather than misrepresenting and refuting a specific counter-argument presented by the senators.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text's framing, particularly the line "Looks like when you are so gung ho to go after someone... it will eventually come back to bite you," is a form of whataboutism. It deflects from the substance of the senators' criticism of Kavanaugh by accusing them of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a deeply negative view of Senators Harris and Warren and the Democratic Party as a whole. This is achieved through a dense combination of propaganda techniques. The article employs aggressive name-calling ("criminal Democrat Party," "Fauxahontas") and loaded language to create an emotional, rather than a rational, response. It uses whataboutism to frame the ethics complaint as righteous hypocrisy. Most significantly, it introduces a powerful red herring—the repeated, fear-inducing poll about using military force against a migrant caravan—which is entirely unrelated to the article's topic. This is a classic propaganda tactic designed to distract and inflame the reader's passions on a separate issue, associating those negative feelings with the subjects of the article. While it reports on a factual event (the filing of an ethics complaint) and uses an appeal to authority (citing FACT and The Washington Times) to appear credible, the framing, language, and manipulative structure confirm its nature as propaganda.
