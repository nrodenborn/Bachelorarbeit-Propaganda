1. Name calling – No – The text reports on events and statements but does not use insulting labels to attack any person or group. Terms like "autocratic" are used descriptively to characterize a form of government.
2. Repetition – No – The article presents a developing story with multiple facets and does not repeat a single message.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea. It quotes phrases used by others, but does not employ them as its own tool.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text reports on a frightening situation but does not use fear to support a particular idea or agenda.
5. Doubt – No – The text reports on facts and a lack of evidence that may cause the reader to feel doubt (e.g., "Saudi officials insisted that Khashoggi left the consulate but have provided no video or other evidence"), but the author does not directly employ this as a technique to discredit someone without a factual basis.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text reports on others who may be minimizing the situation (e.g., Trump's "rogue killers" theory), but the author's reporting style is balanced and does not use this technique.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – No – While the text uses strong words like "shocking" or "furor," they are used to accurately describe the gravity of the situation and the reactions to it, rather than to manipulate the reader's emotions with biased language.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or person to groups hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest the reader should adopt an idea because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text highlights the complexity of the diplomatic crisis, mentioning various factors like the US-Saudi alliance, oil, and regional politics, rather than attributing it to a single simple cause.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is written with clarity. It reports on the lack of clear answers from certain parties but is not itself intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text quotes authorities like the Secretary of State and the President, but it does so to report their statements and positions, not to use their authority as proof of a claim. This is standard journalistic attribution.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text presents multiple perspectives and potential scenarios regarding the journalist's disappearance, avoiding the presentation of only two choices.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases designed to discourage critical thought; instead, it reports on a complex issue that invites it.
16. Red herring – No – All the information presented, such as the context of the U.S.-Saudi alliance, is relevant to the central topic.
17. Straw men – No – The text reports on the actual arguments and statements made by the involved parties, rather than misrepresenting them.
18. Whataboutism – No – The author does not use the technique of charging an opponent with hypocrisy to deflect from an issue.

Verdict – 5% – The text is an example of standard journalistic reporting, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about a developing event, not to persuade them to adopt a specific viewpoint. This is evidenced by several key characteristics:
1.  **Attribution:** Nearly every claim or opinion is attributed to a specific source (Pompeo, the State Department, President Trump, Turkish media reports, critics). The author maintains a neutral, reporting voice.
2.  **Multiple Perspectives:** The article presents the positions and actions of various parties, including the U.S. government, the Saudi rulers, Turkish officials (via media reports), and critics of the administration. It does not champion one side.
3.  **Contextualization:** It provides relevant background on the U.S.-Saudi relationship, including oil, Iran, and arms deals, to help the reader understand the complexity of the situation rather than simplifying it for a persuasive purpose.
Based on the provided definitions, the text does not utilize propaganda techniques. It is a factual news report. The low 5% likelihood accounts for any potential, unintentional bias inherent in word choice or story framing, but it does not actively employ manipulative techniques and is therefore not propaganda.
