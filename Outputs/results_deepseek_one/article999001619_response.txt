Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "vilification" (used repeatedly to describe The Guardian's actions toward Assange), "fake news" (to discredit the journalism).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated use of "vilification," "corporate media," and variations of "unverified/fabricated claims."  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings that the story will "pave the way" for Assange's extradition, imprisonment, and silencing of transparency efforts.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions The Guardian's credibility: "so full of holes," "no fact-checking," "uncheckable sources."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Minimizes The Guardian's credibility ("profoundly irresponsible journalism") while exaggerating its malice ("systematic" attacks, "shores up neoliberal order").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Vilification," "fabrication," "unhinged attacks," "venom," "rapacious financial industries," "imperialist agenda" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeals to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes complex issues (e.g., Clinton's 2016 loss, Corbyn criticism) primarily to Guardian conspiracies: "shifts attention away from [Democrats'] failure."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Vague references to "security services" (no specific agencies/evidence) and "deeper malaise" (undefined systemic flaw).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites Glenn Greenwald, Craig Murray, and Gareth Porter as credible counters to The Guardian.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Portrays The Guardian as deliberately malicious ("designed to" attack dissenters) rather than potentially mistaken.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Fake news," "corporate media," "neoliberal order" (used to dismiss opposing narratives without engagement).  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Shifts to unrelated critiques of The Guardian’s coverage of Corbyn, Latin America, and Tony Blair to discredit it broadly.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Claims The Guardian asserts "absolute certainty" after it amended the article to attribute claims to sources.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Deflects criticism by citing The Guardian’s support for Tony Blair/Iraq War: "None of that is discussed... grounds for disqualifying Blair."  

---

**Verdict – 80%** – The text employs numerous propaganda techniques to frame The Guardian as a malicious actor systematically vilifying Assange to serve elite interests. It uses loaded language, doubt, and causal oversimplification to discredit the publication, while red herrings (e.g., Corbyn, Blair) broaden the attack. Though it raises valid concerns about journalistic standards, its one-sided narrative, emotional rhetoric, and lack of concrete counter-evidence (beyond appeals to critics like Greenwald) reveal a persuasive intent beyond neutral analysis. The insistence that The Guardian’s actions are intentional ("designed to" uphold neoliberalism) rather than potentially flawed journalism further signals propagandistic framing.
