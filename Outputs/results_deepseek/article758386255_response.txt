### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Bergoglians" (used as an insulting label for Pope Francis and his supporters), "wrecking-ball pontificate," "Big Brother hit-squad," and "neo-modernist heretics."  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on "autonomy" (mentioned 46 times), "viability," "suppression," and "federation" to reinforce criticism of Vatican policies.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans; the text relies on analytical language.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warns that contemplative life is under threat, comparing Vatican policies to secular purges (e.g., "closed" monasteries under Henry VIII/Soviets) and linking "suppression" to euthanasia ethics.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions Vatican motives (e.g., "How do you know? Because we’re telling you it has") and accuses documents of hidden agendas ("the entire game is given away").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates Vatican control as Orwellian ("leaves Orwell in the dust"), minimizes Vatican claims of continuity as dishonest ("simply claim there are no problems").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No appeals to patriotism or group identity; focuses on theological critique.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotionally charged terms like "thorn," "contempt," "destruction," "reign of terror," "heretical," and "schismatics" to vilify opponents.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis; secular regimes (e.g., Soviets) are referenced but not conflated.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to popularity; critiques mainstream ("modern Church") views.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames Vatican II solely for religious life collapse (e.g., "massive systemic changes" caused decline), ignoring other factors.  
12. **Obfuscation** – **No** – The text criticizes Vatican documents for vagueness (e.g., "vitality in living the charism") but does not itself use unclear language.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Uses sources (e.g., Tosatti) for critique, not as unquestionable proof.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents a dichotomy: "Catholic programme of Christ" (good) vs. "Bergoglian/Kasperian programme" (bad).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "end of discussion"; invites critical analysis.  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The bioethics analogy, while inflammatory, ties directly to "autonomy" criteria in the document.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Misrepresents Vatican documents (e.g., claims they demand "usefulness" in a utilitarian sense, ignoring spiritual context).  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy; focuses on policy critique.

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 90% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic.** It employs multiple techniques—name-calling, loaded language, fear appeals, exaggeration, and straw men—to advance a one-sided polemic against Pope Francis and Vatican reforms. The author selectively interprets documents (e.g., "usefulness," "autonomy") to frame them as secularizing attacks on tradition, omitting counterarguments. Emotional rhetoric ("reign of terror," "Big Brother") and historical comparisons (Soviets, euthanasia) amplify alarmism. While based on real documents, the presentation is manipulative, aiming to delegitimize Vatican authority rather than engage neutrally. The 10% uncertainty stems from factual references to Church documents, but these are weaponized to serve the narrative.
