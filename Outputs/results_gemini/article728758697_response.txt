1. Name calling – Yes – The title labels Louis Farrakhan a “Hitler-Loving Anti-Semite.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the media ignores racism and anti-Semitism from Democrats/the left is repeated, for example, "The media is very interested in racism. Except when it's coming from inside the house" and "The media is happy to talk about anti-Semitism. It just won't address left-wing anti-Semitism and racism."
3. Slogans – No – The text uses strong phrases but does not employ brief, memorable slogans to encapsulate its message.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text aims to generate anger and outrage rather than instilling direct fear in the audience about a specific negative outcome.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on the credibility of the media and the Democratic party regarding their stance on racism, stating, "The media is very interested in racism. Except when it's coming from inside the house."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates by claiming about Rep. Davis's comments, “He was just saying what most of them think,” generalizing his views to the entire Congressional Black Caucus without evidence.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use patriotic symbols or appeal to national identity to make its argument.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “Hitler-Loving Anti-Semite” and “racist hate group leader” to create a strong emotional response in the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of Rep. Danny Davis by linking him to Louis Farrakhan, who is quoted as praising Adolf Hitler, a figure universally hated by the target audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular; rather, it frames its argument as an exposé of something the mainstream is ignoring.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex issue of media coverage by attributing the lack of reporting on this specific story to a single cause: “It just won't address left-wing anti-Semitism and racism.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – No – While it quotes a source, the text does not use the support of a respected authority figure or institution as the primary evidence for its own claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by implying that the media either covers this story or is deliberately biased, as shown in the line: "The media is happy to talk about anti-Semitism. It just won't address left-wing anti-Semitism and racism."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; instead, it aims to provoke a specific line of critical thought against its targets.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the "photo of Obama posing with Farrakhan" which, while related, distracts from the central issue of Rep. Davis's specific comments to broaden the attack to a more significant political figure.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text sets up a straw man by stating "The media is happy to talk about anti-Semitism," and then refutes this simplified position by claiming "It just won't address left-wing anti-Semitism and racism," misrepresenting the complex reality of media coverage.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The entire piece is framed around a charge of hypocrisy, exemplified by the question, “Would a Republican get a pass on meeting with a racist hate group leader? Obviously not.” This deflects from the core issue to accuse others of double standards.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. While it is based on a factual event (Rep. Danny Davis's comments about Louis Farrakhan), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint. The piece systematically employs a multitude of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal.

The text begins with a highly inflammatory title using **Name Calling** and **Loaded Language** to immediately frame the subjects in a negative light. Its core argument is built on **Whataboutism** and the **Black & White Fallacy**, relentlessly pushing the idea that the media and Democrats are hypocrites by contrasting the situation with a hypothetical one involving a Republican. It casts **Doubt** on the integrity of the media and offers a **Causal Oversimplification** for their alleged silence (a refusal to address "left-wing" racism). The author makes a sweeping **Exaggeration** by claiming Davis's words reflect what "most of them think," a statement made without evidence.

An objective news report would state the facts of what was said, provide context on Farrakhan's history, and seek comment from the relevant parties. This text goes far beyond that, constructing a narrative of deliberate, malicious hypocrisy. The sheer density of the identified propaganda techniques confirms that the author's intent is to manipulate the reader's emotions and opinions rather than to present information neutrally.
