Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack a subject. It quotes a politician being sarcastic, but this does not fit the definition of name-calling.

Repetition – No – The text is a news report and does not repeat the same message over and over.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text quotes Jimmie Akesson saying, “People are shot to death in pizza restaurants, people are killed by hand grenades they find on the street,” which is intended to instill fear in the audience about the state of the country.

Doubt – Yes – The text reports that there is "confidence falling in the police and the judicial system," which serves to cast doubt on the effectiveness of these institutions.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text quotes Jimmie Akesson saying, “This is the new Sweden,” which is an exaggeration that suggests isolated, though serious, incidents are representative of the entire country's current state.

Flag-Waving – Yes – Jimmie Akesson’s quote, “This is the new Sweden; the new, exciting dynamic, multicultural paradise,” is a sarcastic appeal to a particular vision of national identity by contrasting it with a negative portrayal of the current one.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text quotes Jimmie Akesson’s sarcastic use of the phrase “multicultural paradise” to evoke a negative emotional response from the audience towards the policies he is criticizing.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – There is no comparison made to Nazis or other hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text reports on a trend of public opinion ("increasing numbers of Swedes worried about crime") but does not use this popularity to persuade the reader to adopt the view.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text states that the "Sweden Democrats linking public concern about the rising crime rate to a large increase in the numbers of immigrants" is an example of presenting a simple cause for a complex issue.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The language in the text is direct and clear.

Appeal to authority – No – The text cites official sources such as the Prime Minister and a national crime prevention council, which is standard journalistic attribution, not a fallacious appeal to prove a point.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present only two choices. It mentions several government responses to crime.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases that are meant to discourage critical thought.

Red herring – No – All information presented in the text is relevant to the central topic of crime and political responses in Sweden.

Straw men – Yes – The text quotes Jimmie Akesson attacking a caricature of his opponents' position, describing their work as an effort to create a "new, exciting dynamic, multicultural paradise," an argument they themselves did not present.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain any charges of hypocrisy against an opponent.

***

Verdict – 10% – The text itself is a news report, not a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about a situation in Sweden by presenting facts, statistics, and statements from key political figures. The language of the reporting is neutral and sources are attributed, which are hallmarks of journalism. However, the text contains direct quotes from politicians (primarily Jimmie Akesson) that employ numerous propaganda techniques, including Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language, Exaggeration, and Straw Men. The text is therefore a vehicle for propaganda, but it is not propaganda itself. The low percentage reflects that while the reporting appears objective, the selection and framing of quotes could contain a subtle bias, but its primary function is informational rather than persuasive.
