Here's the analysis of the text based on the defined propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against any object or subject.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message (cooler sun predicted, minimal impact on global warming) is stated clearly but not repeated excessively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to promote an idea.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While historical cooling during the Maunder Minimum is mentioned, the text explicitly states scientists "aren't worried" and that the event will have "very little effect" on man-made global warming. It provides context, not fear.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The credibility of scientists or the research is not questioned; it is presented authoritatively.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The description of the predicted cooling ("around seven percent cooler") and its potential effects ("temporary shakeup", "very little effect on... global warming") appears factual and measured. Historical effects are described without apparent over/understatement.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There are no appeals to patriotism or group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is largely neutral and descriptive (e.g., "particularly rare event", "unusually cool", "particularly calm moment", "temporary shakeup"). No obvious emotional or stereotypical triggers are used.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No idea is disapproved of by linking it to a hated group.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The popularity of the idea is not used as a reason to accept it. Acceptance is implied through scientific authority, not popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text acknowledges complexity: "forecasting specific differences has proven difficult" and distinguishes the event from the dominant global warming trend.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The explanations are clear: "Grand Solar Minimum", "seven percent cooler", "Maunder Minimum", effects on ozone/weather, distinction from anthropogenic warming. Terms are defined.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text relies on the authority of scientists and a specific published study: "scientists are projecting", "experts are predicting", "The study, which was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, was carried out by a team led by physicist Dan Lubin...".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents nuances: the Maunder Minimum caused cooling in some areas but warming in others (Alaska, Greenland), and the predicted event is framed as having localized effects but minimal impact on the overall global warming trend.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thought. The text invites understanding of the science.
16. **Red herring** – No – All information presented (solar cycles, predictions, historical precedent, potential effects, relationship to modern warming) is directly relevant to the main topic.
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented or weaker arguments are presented to be refuted.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are made against any opponent or viewpoint.

**Verdict – 0% –** The text is a straightforward science news article reporting on a specific scientific prediction and its context. It cites authoritative sources (scientists, a peer-reviewed study), presents data and historical comparisons, acknowledges complexity and uncertainty in forecasting specific weather impacts, and explicitly differentiates the predicted solar event's minor impact from the dominant trend of anthropogenic global warming. The language is neutral and informative, focusing on explaining the science rather than promoting a particular agenda, attacking opponents, or manipulating emotions. The use of "Appeal to Authority" is standard and appropriate for scientific reporting, relying on expertise rather than fallacious reasoning. There are no other indicators of propaganda techniques being employed.
