1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Said Khecharem referring to the “filthy Jewish entity.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll embedded in the text repeats the question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” three times.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text describes the audience responding to the speaker with “delighted screams of ‘Allahu akbar’” which is used as a rallying cry or slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The article’s central theme is a call for the conquest of Western nations (“America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”), creating fear of an impending threat. The author reinforces this by stating Western authorities are not taking the threat seriously, implying future negative consequences: “But they will.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The author questions the credibility and sincerity of mainstream Islamic groups by stating they “issue pro-forma condemnations after every jihad terror attack, but are doing little or nothing to try to prevent the next one.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the influence and representativeness of Said Khecharem’s views, framing them as “mainstream, normative Islam” for fourteen centuries. Conversely, the author minimizes any potential opposition by stating “there has never been in Islamic history an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by listing specific Western nations as targets for conquest: “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy.” This frames the issue as an external threat to the reader's national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases such as “filthy Jewish entity,” “relentless jihad warfare,” and “deluded fanatic raving” to evoke negative emotions in the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest that any idea is popular with Nazis or other similarly hated groups to discredit it.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea. In fact, it argues the opposite, suggesting that most people are wrongly ignoring the threat.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the cause of 14 centuries of conflict by attributing it solely to a core belief in Islam to “wage war against and subjugate unbelievers,” ignoring complex historical, political, and economic factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s message is direct and clear, not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites himself and his own book as an authority on the subject: “As I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS…” He also cites the “Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI)” as the source for the initial report.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy where Muslims are either actively waging jihad or are passively complicit, ignoring any middle ground: “there has never been in Islamic history an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad and dedicated to stopping those who were waging it.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to end discussion; instead, it makes detailed (though biased) arguments to provoke a specific line of thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a completely irrelevant poll about Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation in the middle of the article, distracting from the main topic.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an argument that is not fully presented or defended in the text: the idea that violent actors are just a “tiny minority of extremists.” He sets up this common counter-argument to knock it down and replace it with his own thesis that this view is “mainstream, normative Islam.”
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges opponents with hypocrisy by stating: “If Said Khecharem were a non-Muslim saying that Muslims needed to destroy ‘the filthy Jewish entity’... he would be accused of ‘Islamophobia’ and ‘bigotry.’ But no one will take any particular notice of this.” This deflects from the primary subject by pointing to the perceived double standards of others.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly a piece of propaganda. Its fundamental strategy is to take the inflammatory statements of one individual from a specific extremist organization and use them to characterize the entire religion of Islam and its followers throughout history.

The article systematically employs numerous propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. It heavily relies on an **Appeal to fear** by presenting a direct threat of conquest to Western nations. It uses **Loaded Language** ("filthy Jewish entity," "relentless jihad") and **Name calling** to create a strong emotional aversion.

The author constructs a logically flawed argument using fallacies like **Causal Oversimplification** (attributing all conflict to Islam's core tenets), the **Black & White Fallacy** (presenting Muslims as either jihadists or passive enablers), and a **Straw Man** (refuting the "tiny minority of extremists" argument to push his own). Through **Exaggeration**, the speaker's views are amplified to represent "mainstream, normative Islam," while any opposing views within Islam are minimized.

To bolster his position, the author uses an **Appeal to Authority** by citing his own book. He simultaneously casts **Doubt** on the sincerity of mainstream Muslim organizations and uses **Whataboutism** to accuse critics of hypocrisy. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant **Red Herring** poll about Brett Kavanaugh further demonstrates that the article's purpose is not purely informational but rather to persuade, distract, and potentially collect user data for a specific political audience. The combination of these techniques is designed to bypass rational analysis and instill a specific, fearful, and generalized worldview about a complex topic, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
