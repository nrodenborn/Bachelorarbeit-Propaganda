### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic, employing **15 of 18 techniques** to frame social media content moderation as a coordinated attack on freedom. Key indicators:  
- **Fear-mongering**: Uses apocalyptic language ("TERRIFY," "brainwashing," "doomed") to portray platform policies as existential threats.  
- **Us-vs-Them framing**: Creates a binary where "freedom-loving" alternative media battle "freedom-hating" establishment/government-aligned entities.  
- **Selective evidence**: Cites pro-alternative media sources (Sputnik, Breitbart) while dismissing mainstream outlets as hypocritical.  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Loaded terms ("purge," "treason") and appeals to freedom/patriotism override factual analysis of platform violations.  
- **Conspiracy framing**: Asserts coordination between governments, corporations, and media without evidence.  
- **Call to action**: Urges readers to bypass mainstream platforms (e.g., join Gab), reinforcing insularity.  

While based on real events (account removals), the text distorts context by omitting policy violations, ignoring platform autonomy, and substituting evidence with hyperbole. Its primary goal is to radicalize opposition to establishment narratives, not inform. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges minor factual elements (e.g., quote sources), but these are weaponized to serve the propagandistic thesis.
