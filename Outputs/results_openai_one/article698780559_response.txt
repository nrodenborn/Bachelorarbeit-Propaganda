**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict – 85% –**  
The text employs several propaganda techniques, notably appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, and intentional vagueness.

These are hallmarks of propaganda designed to manipulate the audience’s perception and foster distrust. While it does not use every technique, the presence of multiple strong propaganda methods makes it highly likely (85%) that this text is propaganda.
