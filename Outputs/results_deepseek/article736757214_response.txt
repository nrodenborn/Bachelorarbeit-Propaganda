Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Illegal Alien Mexican Rapist", "their rapists", "unsavory characters".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on subjects being Mexican, having prior deportations, and convictions for serious crimes (especially sexual ones) and DUIs.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No distinct, brief, memorable phrase is used as a slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Focuses on violent and sexual criminals evading capture to instill fear about the consequences of sanctuary policies and the mayor's actions.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "claims to fight for women. Except when she's fighting for their rapists instead." This directly questions the sincerity and credibility of the mayor's stated position.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – The headline "Sanctuary City Mayor Protected Illegal Alien Mexican Rapist" exaggerates by implying the mayor *protected a specific rapist* (singular, labeled "Mexican Rapist") and minimizes the complexity of her broad warning. The text also minimizes context about sanctuary city policies.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Protected", "Illegal Alien Mexican Rapist", "their rapists", "unsavory characters", "evading capture", "infuriating", "sodomizing a drugged victim" – all use emotionally charged words and stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No attempt to link the ideas or people to universally hated groups (e.g., Nazis).
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to the popularity of the idea being presented.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Implies the mayor's warning was the *sole* reason these individuals evaded capture ("may have led to", "many more could have been caught if they hadn't been warned"), ignoring other potential factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct and specific in its accusations and examples.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites "ICE officials", "A spokesperson for ICE", and "Fox News" to lend credibility to the claims and examples.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents the mayor's actions as a binary choice: fighting for women vs. fighting for their rapists ("Except when she's fighting for their rapists instead").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Phrases like "Illegal Alien Mexican Rapist" and "fighting for their rapists" are hyperbolic labels designed to shut down nuanced discussion about immigration policy or the mayor's intent.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The text stays focused on the mayor's warning and the criminals who evaded capture. No significant irrelevant material is introduced.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Reframes the mayor's broad warning about an ICE raid (potentially affecting many immigrants) as specifically "fighting for their rapists" and "protect[ing]" a singular "Illegal Alien Mexican Rapist". This misrepresents her action as targeted protection of violent criminals.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not charge the mayor with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated actions or positions.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs numerous propaganda techniques extensively:
*   The inflammatory **Name Calling** ("Illegal Alien Mexican Rapist") sets a highly biased tone immediately.
*   **Loaded Language** permeates the entire piece, using emotionally charged terms like "protected," "their rapists," "unsavory characters," and graphic descriptions of crimes to evoke anger and fear.
*   It uses **Appeal to Fear** by highlighting specific, heinous criminals who evaded capture, implying this is the direct and inevitable result of the mayor's policy/warning.
*   It employs the **Black & White Fallacy** and **Doubt** to starkly contrast the mayor's stated values with a distorted version of her actions.
*   **Causal Oversimplification** blames the evasion solely on the warning, ignoring other complexities.
*   **Thought-Terminating Clichés** like the headline label prevent critical engagement with the actual policy debate.
*   **Straw Men** arguments grossly misrepresent the nature of the mayor's warning as direct aid to specific rapists.
*   **Repetition** of nationality (Mexican), prior deportations, and crime types reinforces a specific negative stereotype.
*   While citing sources (**Appeal to Authority**), the selection and presentation of the examples (only the most violent offenders who evaded capture) is clearly designed to support a specific, alarmist narrative and maximize outrage, rather than provide a balanced report on the raid's outcomes or the broader issue of sanctuary cities.

The text's primary purpose is not to neutrally inform but to provoke strong negative emotions (anger, fear, disgust) towards the mayor and sanctuary city policies by using sensationalist language, selective facts, and logical fallacies. The sheer density and nature of the techniques used make it highly propagandistic. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of factual elements (the warning was given, some criminals with serious records evaded capture), but these facts are embedded within and presented through a heavily manipulative and distorted framework characteristic of propaganda.
