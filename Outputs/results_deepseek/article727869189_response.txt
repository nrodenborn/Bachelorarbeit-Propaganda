Below is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text, followed by a final verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "rhetorical tricks and soft-peddled Hegelianism" (used to dismiss Faggioli's methods as deceptive).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or idea is repeated excessively to enforce a message.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed for rallying support (e.g., no catchphrases like "Make America Great Again").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings like "a dictatorship of relativism" and losing the ability to "judge right from wrong" instill fear about societal collapse.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "this progressive interpretation... eventually reveals itself to be rank historicism" questions Faggioli's credibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Arguments are presented directly without clear amplification/downplaying (e.g., Faggioli's stance is criticized but not exaggerated beyond his quoted points).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to Catholic identity (e.g., "the flock," "truth," and tradition) and institutional loyalty.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like "absurd," "preposterous," "dangerous," and "rank historicism" evoke negative emotions.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – Does not claim popularity for the author’s position (e.g., no "most Catholics agree...").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Simplifies Faggioli’s argument as the Church "bend[ing] to the will of secular society," ignoring nuances of pastoral adaptation.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are clearly articulated (e.g., criticisms of historicism are explicit).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Quotes Pope Benedict XVI as definitive evidence against accommodation: "Pope Benedict XVI has warned against...".  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents only two options: uphold absolute truth ("institutions that upheld this truth for centuries") or accept "relativism" with no middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Dictatorship of relativism" ends debate by framing opposing views as inherently destructive.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introduces Donald Trump’s presidency ("impossible to judge... Donald Trump") to distract from theological debate.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents Faggioli as wanting the Church to "bend to secular society" rather than reform pastoral practices.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no "what about your sins?").  

---

**Verdict – 65% –** The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques (e.g., loaded language, appeal to fear, straw men, black-and-white fallacy) and is openly polemical, framing theological debate as a battle for absolute truth. The author’s goal is to discredit progressive interpretations of Catholicism by associating them with moral decay ("relativism") and secular collapse, while glorifying tradition via appeals to authority (Pope Benedict) and identity. However, it is not *pure* propaganda: it summarizes a real debate, cites specific arguments (e.g., Faggioli’s German example), and targets a niche audience (Catholic intellectuals). Its persuasive intent and selective framing push it toward propaganda, but its basis in an actual event and lack of overt repetition/slogans prevent a higher likelihood.
