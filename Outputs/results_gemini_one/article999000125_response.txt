Name calling – No – The text reports that Patel’s jokes were “criticized as racist and homophobic,” but the article itself does not use these labels to attack him. It is reporting on the criticism made by others.

Repetition – No – The article presents a sequence of events and includes several different viewpoints. No single message is repeated to persuade the audience.

Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases intended to rally support for or against a cause.

Appeal to fear – No – The text reports on a disagreement at a comedy show. It does not attempt to instill fear in the reader about any particular outcome or idea.

Doubt – No – The article presents differing opinions on the event, but it does not actively cast doubt on the credibility of any of the individuals or groups involved. It reports their statements and actions neutrally.

Exaggeration/minimization – No – The article reports the facts of the event without sensationalizing or downplaying them. It provides a balanced account by including multiple perspectives.

Flag-Waving – No – While the event itself is about "Asian American artistic expression," an appeal to a specific identity, the article is merely reporting this fact for context and is not using patriotism or identity to persuade the reader.

Loaded Language – No – The article uses neutral language to describe the events. Words like “denounced” or “inappropriate” are attributed to the people involved in the story, not used by the author to frame the narrative.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The article does not suggest that an idea is correct because it is popular. In fact, it highlights a division of opinion among the audience members.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text avoids simplifying the cause of the conflict. It presents multiple viewpoints and contributing factors, such as the content of the jokes, the context of the event, and generational differences in perspective.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article is a clear and straightforward news report. It states what happened, who was involved, and what they said without deliberate confusion.

Appeal to authority – No – The text mentions Nimesh Patel’s professional credentials and quotes students who were present, but this is for providing context and eyewitness accounts, not as evidence to prove a particular argument is correct.

Black & white fallacy – No – The article presents more than two sides to the issue, quoting three different students with nuanced perspectives in addition to reporting the actions of Patel and the organizers. This is the opposite of a black & white fallacy.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The article itself does not use any phrases to shut down discussion. It quotes a student, Sofia Jao, who is actively criticizing the use of such a cliché (“our generation needs to be exposed to the real world”).

Red herring – No – All the information presented in the text, such as the background of the performer and the purpose of the event, is relevant to understanding the story. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract the reader.

Straw men – No – The article presents the arguments and reactions of those involved directly. It does not misrepresent anyone's position to make it easier to critique.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not contain any instances of charging an opponent with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 5% – The text is a piece of journalism, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform, not persuade. This is evident from its neutral tone, attribution of opinions to their sources, and inclusion of multiple, differing viewpoints on the event. It systematically avoids using the listed propaganda techniques. Instead of pushing a single narrative, it presents the complexity of the situation, quoting people who supported the decision to remove the comedian, people who did not find the jokes offensive, and another who took issue with the comedian's reaction rather than his jokes. This balanced reporting is the antithesis of propaganda. The 5% likelihood accounts for the inherent, unavoidable biases in journalism, such as the choice of which quotes to include, but there is no evidence of a deliberate attempt to manipulate the reader.
