### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 85% –**  
The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs several propaganda techniques, notably doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, intentional vagueness, and red herring. The article systematically questions the official narrative, casts suspicion on authorities, and uses emotionally charged and vague language to sow distrust and confusion. While it does not use all possible techniques, the presence of multiple classic propaganda strategies and the overall intent to undermine confidence in the official story strongly indicate propagandistic intent. The likelihood is not 100% only because the text does not use every possible technique and maintains some factual recounting, but the manipulative framing is clear and dominant.
