Here's the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

**Propaganda Technique Analysis:**
1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to the US, the employee, or the claims.
2. **Repetition** – No – Key messages (e.g., "no clues found," "China protects safety") are stated once, not repeated.
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to promote an idea.
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No attempt to instill fear about alternatives or consequences.
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – *"So far we have not yet found causes or clues to the situation described by the US"* implicitly questions the validity of the US claim.
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Descriptions (e.g., "mild traumatic brain injury") are factual without obvious amplification or downplaying.
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – *"China has always protected the safety of workers... according to the Vienna Convention"* appeals to national responsibility and adherence to international norms.
8. **Loaded Language** – No – Language is largely neutral (e.g., "earnest investigation," "preliminary feedback") without strong emotional triggers.
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association with hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to the popularity of China's position.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Complexity is acknowledged (e.g., "cause remains unresolved" for Cuba incident).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Statements are specific (e.g., location: Guangzhou; timeframe: late 2017-April).
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Reliance on official sources (Lu Kang, US Embassy statements) to validate claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dilemma is presented.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to shut down critical analysis.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – *"In October, the US government expelled 15 Cuban diplomats..."* introduces an unresolved, similar incident potentially to distract from scrutiny of China's investigation.
17. **Straw men** – No – China addresses the actual US claim (health incident) without misrepresentation.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The Cuba reference isn't used to directly accuse the US of hypocrisy; it's framed as contextual background.

**Verdict – 15% –** The text contains limited propaganda elements (Doubt, Flag-Waving, Appeal to Authority, Red Herring), but these are subtle and embedded within a primarily factual, news-reporting structure. The core purpose appears to be informational: reporting China's investigation outcome, US actions, and historical context. Propaganda techniques are used to *frame* China's response (emphasizing diligence/patriotism) and subtly undermine the US narrative, but they do not dominate the text. The inclusion of US statements, clinical terminology ("mild traumatic brain injury"), and unresolved details balances the narrative. This reflects standard diplomatic messaging rather than overt propaganda.
