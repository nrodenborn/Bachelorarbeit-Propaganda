1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to migrants as an “invading” force and “potential illegals,” which are insulting labels used to attack them.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the word “invasion” and mentions the deployment of troops and barbed/razor wire multiple times. The poll question “Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?” is also repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text mentions the military operation by its official name, “Operation Faithful Patriot,” which functions as a memorable phrase to frame the deployment.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The article uses words like “invasion,” “repel,” and “overtake the border,” and details the massive military response (thousands of troops, razor wire, drones) to instill fear about the approaching migrant caravan.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text directly challenges skepticism by stating, “Anyone who doubts this is an invasion only need look at the size of the caravan…”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the threat by labeling the caravan an “invasion” requiring a military response potentially larger than the US force in Afghanistan. It also minimizes the presence of families by stating, “there are few woman and children that make up the mass.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by highlighting the deployment of the “U.S. ARMY,” “National Guardsmen,” and naming the mission “Operation Faithful Patriot.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “invasion,” “repel,” “brutal force,” and “beautiful barbed wire” to evoke strong emotional responses.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other groups widely hated by the target audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that the reader should agree with the premise because it is popular or because “everyone else” does.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex issue of migration by presenting it as a simple “invasion” of young men that can be solved with a simple military response, ignoring the root causes of the migration.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its messaging, aiming to alarm rather than confuse with vague language.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly cites President Trump, the Pentagon, and the head of the Northern Command to lend credibility and authority to the actions being described.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a choice between a massive military reinforcement or allowing an “invasion.” The poll also presents a false choice: “Yes, he should have gotten it back” versus the loaded option, “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The poll answer “No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass” is a cliché that dismisses the complexities of the issue and discourages further thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about whether Jim Acosta should have his press pass back is completely irrelevant to the topic of the migrant caravan and serves only to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the unstated argument that the migrants are legitimate asylum seekers by portraying them as a hostile, male-dominated “invading” force, which is a misrepresentation of the group’s actual composition and intent.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast array of propaganda techniques with high frequency to construct a specific, emotionally-charged narrative. The primary goal is to dehumanize the migrants by labeling them an “invasion” (Name Calling, Loaded Language) and to generate fear about their arrival (Appeal to Fear). This narrative is reinforced through the constant repetition of the threat and the military response.

The article heavily relies on exaggeration, framing the caravan as a threat requiring a military force comparable to those in active war zones, while simultaneously minimizing the presence of women and children to amplify the perceived danger. It uses appeals to authority (quoting the President and military commanders) and patriotism (Flag-Waving) to legitimize the extreme measures being taken.

Furthermore, the piece uses logical fallacies to manipulate the reader. It presents a Black & White Fallacy (either support the military action or accept an "invasion"), creates a Straw Man of the migrants' intentions, and oversimplifies the complex issue of migration into a simple problem of hostile actors. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant Red Herring poll about Jim Acosta is a particularly telling sign that the article's purpose is not to inform but to engage in partisan manipulation and distract from the core issues. The sheer density and combination of these techniques confirm the text's primary function as propaganda.
