1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) as a "radical anti-Israel hate group" and an "anti-Israel BDS hate group". It also refers to Dan Fishback's arguments as "entitled nonsense".
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the label "anti-Israel hate group" to describe JVP and the hashtag "#BDStears" to mock the reactions of BDS activists.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses "#BDStears" as a brief, memorable, and derogatory phrase to encapsulate and dismiss the complaints of BDS activists.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text supports its negative portrayal of JVP by linking it to an "anti-Semite who accused Jews of drinking blood," invoking the historical and fear-inducing blood libel accusation to generate fear and disgust towards the group.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is an exercise in casting doubt on the credibility and sincerity of Dan Fishback, portraying him as a hypocrite who "whines" and whose arguments are "entitled nonsense".
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by comparing the actions of Fishback's supporters to wanting to "burn crosses on their lawn," a gross overstatement. It also minimizes Fishback's concerns about being excluded from Jewish spaces by labeling them as mere "whining".
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific form of Jewish identity and patriotism, framing the conflict as a defense of "Jewish nationhood" and the "human rights of the Jewish people" against those who supposedly attack "their Jewishness".
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like "radical", "hate group", "whines", "entitled nonsense", and "anti-Semite" to evoke a strong negative emotional response from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of Dan Fishback by lumping him in with groups hated by the intended audience: "Him, the PLO and the KKK."
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. Instead, it positions itself as defending a core community value against a supposedly "rapidly growing" dissenting group.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the reason for boycotting Fishback’s play to a simple cause: "It's resistance to a propaganda campaign intended to attack the human rights of the Jewish people," ignoring other potential complexities of the situation.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; its language is direct, blunt, and aggressive in its accusations.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The author does not cite any external, respected authorities to validate their claims, relying instead on their own assertions and interpretations.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice: one either supports "Jewish nationhood" or is an "anti-Israel activist" part of a "hate group." It leaves no room for nuance or alternative perspectives.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the cliché "what's good for the goose is good for the gander" to shut down any nuanced discussion about the different contexts of the boycotts, implying a false equivalence.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a tweet about Hamas from Jonathan Kuttab, who is not Dan Fishback. This serves to distract from the core issue of Fishback's play and instead taints the entire event by association with a separate, more controversial topic.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes an argument Fishback did not make. Fishback's call for "dissent" is distorted into a demand that the Jewish community let people "burn crosses on their lawn," a misrepresentation that is easy to condemn.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The central argument of the piece is a charge of hypocrisy, deflecting from Fishback's complaint about his play being canceled by repeatedly pointing out that he previously supported other boycotts: "Previously Dan Fishback had authored an article arguing for boycotting some Israeli plays. Now he's whining that boycotting his play is a violation of Jewishness."

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. It employs an overwhelming majority of the propaganda techniques listed (15 out of 18). The author's primary goal is not to engage in a reasoned debate but to discredit, mock, and emotionally delegitimize an individual (Dan Fishback) and the groups he is associated with (JVP, BDS). The piece relies heavily on emotional manipulation through Name-calling ("hate group"), Loaded Language ("whines," "entitled nonsense"), and Exaggeration ("burn crosses on their lawn"). It builds its entire argument on a foundation of Whataboutism and a Straw Man fallacy, distorting Fishback's position to make him appear hypocritical and extremist. The use of techniques like Reduction ad Hitlerum ("Him, the PLO and the KKK") and Appeal to Fear further demonstrates an intent to bypass rational thought in favor of a powerful, negative emotional reaction. The lack of nuance, reliance on logical fallacies, and aggressive, ad hominem-focused tone confirm its nature as propaganda rather than persuasive argument.
