Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **No** – While critical of Pompeo ("advocate for war," "not a good fit") and Haspel ("oversaw an illegal black ops operation"), the text avoids using insulting labels directly attacking them as individuals (e.g., "traitor," "monster"). It focuses on their actions and policies.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The phrase "whatever it takes" is repeated by both Rand Paul and the author ("I'll do 'whatever it takes'", "I'll do whatever it takes, and that includes filibuster").
3.  **Slogans** – **Borderline/Weak Yes** – "Whatever it takes" functions as a short, memorable phrase encapsulating Paul's stance. "Enough is enough" also has a slogan-like quality. Not as concise as classic slogans, but fits the intent.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text repeatedly invokes fear about the consequences of confirming Pompeo and Haspel: Pompeo advocating for "war" and "regime change" which "really don't work out too well" (implying disastrous outcomes), and Haspel overseeing "torture," framed as fundamentally un-American and something that "should never lead the CIA." The author also suggests people are "acting out of emotion and fear."
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The author casts doubt on the effectiveness of torture ("I'm not sure I've seen any real hard evidence that torturing them has produced any information") and the reliability of media reports supporting its efficacy ("So, I'm wary of media reports that claim there have been results...").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – While strong opinions are expressed, the descriptions of Pompeo's advocacy for regime change ("really everywhere") and Haspel's involvement in torture ("oversaw an illegal black ops operation") are presented as factual claims, not clear exaggerations or minimizations relative to the author's viewpoint. The claim that "many Americans" support them could be seen as minimizing opposition, but it's not explicit minimization.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to American identity and values are central: "I don't think torture is what America is about," "We are not a people that should be so fearful or vengeful," "We should make a stand on this," and the implication that supporting these nominees means people "do not know their Constitution."
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Words and phrases are chosen for strong negative emotional impact: "advocating for war," "illegal black ops operation," "torture," "vengeful," "media lies," "wary". These evoke strong disapproval and moral outrage.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or universally despised groups like "Vichy" are used to discredit Pompeo, Haspel, or their supporters.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text actually argues *against* the perceived popular support ("many Americans are just fine..."), framing Senator Paul's stance as the principled, minority position. It discourages jumping on the bandwagon of supporting the nominees.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – No complex events (like wars or terror attacks) are attributed to a single, simple cause within this text.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is relatively direct in its criticisms. Phrases like "really don't work out too well" or "few things in life... [are] worth standing up" are somewhat vague but not intentionally obscure or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – The main authority cited is Senator Rand Paul, whose views the author explicitly agrees with ("He's right, too"). The author doesn't invoke a higher, unrelated authority (like a scientist or historical figure) to bolster the argument beyond Paul's position and their own reasoning.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Torture is presented as absolutely unacceptable with no middle ground: "On what level could torture ever be acceptable? ... She should never lead the CIA." The author also frames the choice as understanding the Constitution/warning (Paul's side) vs. acting on emotion/fear/ignorance (supporters).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Phrases like "whatever it takes" or "enough is enough" are calls to action, not clichés used to shut down discussion. The text invites consideration of the arguments about regime change and torture.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The discussion stays focused on the qualifications and records of Pompeo (regime change advocacy) and Haspel (involvement in torture), and the author's reasons for opposing them. The mention of Trump's turnover rate is a minor aside but not a significant distraction from the main argument.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text accurately represents Paul's stated positions against Pompeo (advocacy for regime change/war) and Haspel (involvement in torture). It doesn't misrepresent or exaggerate an opposing view to easily knock it down.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not accuse Pompeo, Haspel, or their supporters of hypocrisy by pointing to their past contradictory actions or statements on unrelated issues. The criticism is direct and based on their stated positions and records relevant to the nominations.

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits several clear propaganda techniques: **Repetition** ("whatever it takes"), **Appeal to fear** (disastrous consequences of regime change, un-American nature of torture), **Doubt** (effectiveness of torture, reliability of media), **Flag-Waving** (appeals to American values/identity against torture/regime change), **Loaded Language** ("war," "illegal," "torture," "lies," "vengeful"), and **Black & white fallacy** (torture is absolutely unacceptable, framing the choice as constitutionality vs. ignorance/emotion). While it presents arguments based on the nominees' records and the author's perspective, the consistent use of emotionally charged language, fear appeals, and absolutist framing on torture, combined with the dismissal of public support as ignorant or fearful, pushes it strongly towards propaganda. Its primary goal is to persuade readers to oppose the nominations using emotional and value-based appeals alongside selected facts, rather than solely presenting a balanced analysis. The inclusion of Trump's supportive tweet offers minimal counterbalance to the overall persuasive intent.
