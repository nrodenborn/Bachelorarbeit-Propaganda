### Propaganda Technique Analysis:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "classic deep state false flag operation" (insults official narrative as a malicious deception)  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – "multiple shooters," "another active shooter," "active shooters on the runway" repeated to reinforce the claim.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "multiple terrorists moving through the hotel shooting guest," "bomb threats," implying broader danger to instill fear about the official story.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "further debunking the official narrative," "calling into question almost every aspect" (explicitly undermines credibility of authorities).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "shocking amount of evidence" (exaggerates strength of evidence); minimizes official investigation by calling it a "cover-up."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "Vegas cover-up," "false flag operation," "terrorists," "desperately trying to prevent" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "dozens of similar reports," citing others (e.g., Cardone, Tokes) to imply widespread consensus.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes the event solely to a "deep state false flag" while ignoring complex investigatory details.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Specific claims are made (though unsupported); no deliberate vagueness detected.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Relies on figures like Shepard Ambellas, Grant Cardone, and Mike Tokes as credible sources.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents binary: *either* official "lone gunman" narrative *or* a "deep state false flag" (ignoring middle ground).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "deep state false flag operation" shuts down critical analysis by invoking a conspiratorial trope.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Shooter "on the runway" distracts from the core event (32nd-floor shooting).  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Portrays the official story as a deliberate "cover-up" (a stronger claim than mere inaccuracy).  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No accusations of hypocrisy against critics.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda**. It employs at least 12 distinct propaganda techniques to advance a conspiracy theory about the Las Vegas shooting. Key indicators include:  
- **Selective Evidence**: Cherry-picks audio clips (e.g., "active shooter" reports) while ignoring official investigations disproving multiple shooters.  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses fear-loaded terms ("terrorists," "pinned down," "false flag") and exploits tragedy to discredit authorities.  
- **Narrative Over Facts**: Dismisses verified evidence (e.g., FBI ballistics, video footage) via "cover-up" rhetoric and thought-terminating clichés ("deep state").  
- **Structural Propaganda**: Relies on repetition, bandwagon appeals, and black/white framing to legitimize the theory. The 5% uncertainty stems from the *potential* good-faith questioning of events, but the overwhelming use of manipulative techniques, absence of counter-evidence, and conclusive "false flag" labeling confirm a propagandistic intent to sway opinion, not inform.  

*Note: The Las Vegas shooting was extensively investigated by federal/state agencies, concluding a lone gunman. Claims of multiple shooters or "false flags" are widely debunked.*
