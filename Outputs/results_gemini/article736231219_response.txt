2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat the same message or phrase over and over.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use a brief, memorable phrase to promote its own message, though it does quote phrases from Farrakhan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text highlights Farrakhan's danger by quoting Jake Tapper who calls him "more dangerous than other 'alt-reich' leaders" and describes his organization's mission as to "throw off the yoke of the inferior white devil."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the attention given to Farrakhan's speech ("practically no one noticed") while exaggerating the media's actions against Donald Trump ("attempting to smear Donald Trump as the new Hitler").
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to the reader's patriotism or national identity to persuade them.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as "raging anti-Semite," "race-monger," "loony," and "hateful organization."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text explicitly accuses the news media of using this technique against Donald Trump, stating they have "spent the last two years attempting to smear Donald Trump as the new Hitler."
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its ideas are popular; in fact, it suggests the opposite by stating "practically no one noticed" the speech.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple reason for the lack of coverage of Farrakhan's speech: "the leftist media entirely focused on the push to ban AR-15s and repeal the Second Amendment," which simplifies complex editorial decisions and news cycles.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's language is direct and not deliberately unclear; their points are stated bluntly.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites "The Washington Examiner" as a source, quotes CNN anchor Jake Tapper to support the claim of Farrakhan's danger, and directs the reader to the "Horowitz Freedom Center's resource site" as an authoritative source.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy where the media is either denouncing Farrakhan or it is unfairly focused on smearing Donald Trump, ignoring other possibilities for news coverage.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion.
16. Red herring – Yes – While the topic is Farrakhan's speech, the author introduces the topics of the push to "ban AR-15s," a suppressed photo of Barack Obama, and the media's treatment of Donald Trump to distract and pivot to a broader political attack.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text creates a straw man of the "leftist media" by claiming it is "entirely focused on the push to ban AR-15s," an exaggeration of its position that is then used to criticize it for not covering Farrakhan.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects from the issue of criticism against figures like Donald Trump by charging the media with hypocrisy: "Somehow the openly racist and anti-Semitic Farrakhan... have managed for decades to avoid being harshly denounced... which instead has spent the last two years attempting to smear Donald Trump..."

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to objectively inform the reader about Louis Farrakhan's speech, but to use the speech as a vehicle to attack the author's political opponents, namely the "leftist media" and Democrats. The article employs a dense concentration of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal.

The author uses emotionally charged **Loaded Language** and **Name Calling** ("raging," "loony," "race-monger") to frame Farrakhan as an undeniable villain. Then, instead of focusing on that topic, the author immediately pivots using a **Red Herring** (the AR-15 debate) and **Whataboutism** to accuse the media of hypocrisy for ignoring this "real" threat while focusing on Donald Trump. This argument is bolstered by a **Straw Man** (the media is "entirely focused" on guns) and a **Black & White Fallacy** that presents the media's only options as covering Farrakhan or smearing Trump.

The author attempts to **Appeal to Authority** by citing The Washington Examiner and Jake Tapper to lend credibility, while simultaneously using **Doubt** and **Causal Oversimplification** to undermine the media's integrity. The reference to the suppressed Obama photo is another **Red Herring** designed to link a political opponent to the villainous Farrakhan. The entire piece is constructed not to report news, but to shape an opinion, direct anger towards a specific group (the media), and promote a particular political worldview, right down to the final sentence which directs the reader to a partisan "resource site."
