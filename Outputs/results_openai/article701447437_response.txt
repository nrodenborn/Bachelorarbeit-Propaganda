Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, and appeal to authority.

However, the text also provides factual information and quotes from officials, which adds some balance. Therefore, while there are clear elements of propaganda, it is not overwhelmingly so, leading to a moderate likelihood of the text being propaganda.
