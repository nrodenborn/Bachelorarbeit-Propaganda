Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the confirmation process as “The Left’s Show Trial” and calls lawyer Michael Avenatti a “media-savvy sleazeball lawyer.”

Repetition – No – While the central theme that the allegations are a political smear is reinforced, the text does not repeat the same specific message or phrase over and over.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses the phrase “Give left-wingers an inch and they’ll take a mile” to summarize the perceived behavior of the political opposition.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that if Kavanaugh is not confirmed quickly, “the Supreme Court will be shorthanded” and that Democrats might take control of the Senate, implying negative consequences for the reader’s side.

Doubt – Yes – The text actively questions the credibility of the accusers with phrases like “dubious improprieties,” “questionable claims,” and “Suspiciously, Ford can’t –or won’t— say when or where the alleged incident happened.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text claims the accusers “materialized out of thin air,” which is an exaggeration. It also minimizes the allegations by framing them simply as a “smear, plain and simple.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a political identity by framing the conflict as one between “Republicans” and “The Left”/“Democrats,” encouraging the reader to side with their political tribe.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that Kavanaugh should be confirmed because it is the popular thing to do.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex situation of multiple sexual assault allegations by attributing them to a single cause: a political “smear” by Democrats to delay the confirmation process.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its viewpoint and accusations; it does not use vague or obscure language to confuse the audience.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites Thomas C. Goldstein of SCOTUSblog, an expert on the Supreme Court, to support the prediction that Kavanaugh will be confirmed.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice: either the allegations are a complete and malicious “smear” orchestrated by Democrats, or they are true. It doesn't allow for any middle ground or nuance.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “Give left-wingers an inch and they’ll take a mile” is used as a simplistic and dismissive generalization to end any nuanced discussion of the Democrats’ actions.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces detailed information about the Supreme Court’s ideological split and the upcoming election to distract from the substance of the allegations and refocus the reader on the political urgency of confirming the nominee.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the unstated argument that the Democrats' goal is purely political delay (“gaming the system,” “delaying tactics”), rather than addressing the stated argument that serious allegations against a Supreme Court nominee warrant investigation.

Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes the Democrats’ actions but does not counter the accusations against Kavanaugh by pointing out hypocrisy or similar alleged wrongdoings by the Democrats.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint. This is achieved through the heavy and combined use of numerous propaganda techniques.

The piece constructs a clear narrative of a righteous individual (Kavanaugh) being unfairly attacked by a malicious, unified entity ("The Left," "Democrats"). It employs loaded language ("show trial," "sleazeball," "smear") and name-calling to demonize the opposition and discredit the accusers from the outset. It consistently uses techniques of doubt and causal oversimplification to frame the entire controversy as nothing more than a cynical political ploy, dismissing the substance of the allegations.

Furthermore, it uses appeal to fear by highlighting the political consequences of failure (a shorthanded court, a Democrat-controlled Senate) and red herrings (focusing on the political timeline over the allegations) to create a sense of urgency that overrides due process. The use of a black & white fallacy presents the situation as a simple choice between supporting Kavanaugh or siding with a malicious political plot, erasing any possibility for nuance. While it contains factual elements (names, dates, quotes), they are all framed within this manipulative narrative. An objective report would present the claims and counter-claims with neutral language, whereas this text uses its language and structure to guide the reader to a predetermined conclusion.
