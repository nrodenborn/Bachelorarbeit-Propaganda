Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The author uses numerous insulting labels to attack individuals and groups, such as calling neoconservatives “neocon scum,” the media the “presstitute media,” and political leaders “corrupt filth.”

Repetition – Yes – The author repeatedly states that the “military/security complex” is the driving force behind the opposition to Trump and the push for conflict with Russia, and that “Russiagate” is a hoax orchestrated for this purpose.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable, and dismissive phrases to label complex subjects, most notably “presstitute media” to refer to the Western press and “Russiagate” to label the investigation into Russian interference.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text repeatedly warns of catastrophic consequences, stating that the Democratic Party is determined to “take the world to thermo-nuclear war” and that failure to heed the author’s warning will result in the US and Europe becoming a “radioactive ruin.”

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is an exercise in casting doubt on the credibility and motives of the US Democratic Party, the media, the CIA, and other government institutions, for example by framing accusations against Trump as part of a coup.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author uses extreme hyperbole, such as describing the Democratic Party as “totally insane,” claiming Russian weapons are so superior that the US is not even a “second class military power,” and stating that those who watch Western media are “brainwashed beyond all hope.”

Flag-Waving – Yes – The author frames the entire conflict in terms of loyalty and betrayal to the nation, accusing the President’s opponents of “high treason against the United States” and quoting John Brennan’s call to “Republican Patriots,” thereby appealing to a sense of national duty.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is saturated with emotionally charged words intended to provoke a strong reaction, such as “scum,” “filth,” “treasonous,” “imbecilic,” and “hoax.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party to discredit an idea.

Bandwagon – No – The author does not appeal to the popularity of his ideas. Instead, he presents himself and his readers as a small, enlightened group standing against a powerful and corrupt majority.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex domestic and international opposition to President Trump’s policies to a single cause: a conspiracy by the “military/security complex” to protect its budget by instigating conflict with Russia.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – While the accusations are blunt, the primary antagonist, the “military/security complex,” is presented as a vague, monolithic entity that “orchestrates” events without specific, verifiable details on how this coordination is achieved.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The author heavily relies on his own claimed authority and experience (“I was a member of the US Senate staff,” “my time at the Wall Street Journal”) and presents himself as the ultimate source of truth, stating, “Keep in mind that no media informs you better than my website.”

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark, binary choice: one is either on the side of Trump and peace, or on the side of the “military/security complex” and nuclear war. There is no room for a nuanced position.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author uses phrases to dismiss and discourage critical thought, such as, “If you don’t believe that this is orchestrated between Pelosi and Schumer, you are stupid beyond belief,” which attacks the person rather than engaging with their potential doubts.

Red herring – Yes – The author introduces a long, detailed anecdote about his work on supply-side economics in the 1970s. While he links it back to his main point, the level of detail serves as a distraction from the central argument about Trump and Russia.

Straw men – Yes – The author misrepresents the position of Trump’s critics by claiming they are simply “opposed to peace” and that they believe “Trump is a traitor because he wants peace with Russia.” This refutes a simplified, false argument rather than engaging with the actual, more complex criticisms.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by charging opponents with hypocrisy. It engages in direct attacks on their character, intelligence, and patriotism.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. It employs a vast majority of the listed techniques not as occasional rhetorical flourishes, but as the fundamental basis of its argument. The piece is not designed to inform, persuade through logic, or foster debate. Instead, its purpose is to construct a conspiratorial worldview by systematically employing techniques like name-calling (“neocon scum,” “presstitute media”), appeal to fear (imminent “thermo-nuclear war”), and causal oversimplification (all opposition to Trump is a plot by the “military/security complex”). It creates a stark black-and-white fallacy where Trump is a heroic peacemaker and all opponents are treasonous, corrupt, or insane. The author establishes himself as the sole authoritative source of truth (“not even God himself” can rescue those who don’t listen), a classic hallmark of a propagandist. The relentless use of loaded language, straw man arguments, and thought-terminating clichés serves to bypass the reader's critical thinking and instill an emotionally-charged, specific, and unsubstantiated narrative.
