Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack the credibility of opposing sources, for example, by describing the mainstream media as displaying "naivete" and calling the official narrative "ridiculous and illogical."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses key phrases and concepts to reinforce its message, such as "JFK assassination," "cover-up," "national security," and the idea that the assassination was a "U.S. national-security regime-change operation."

Slogans – No – The text does not employ its own brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate its ideas. It quotes a tweet from Trump that uses a hashtag, but this is used as evidence, not as the author's own slogan.

Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to support its ideas by instilling fear in the audience about alternative viewpoints or future events. Its focus is on reinterpreting a past event.

Doubt – Yes – The text is built on casting doubt on the credibility of official institutions and narratives. It uses rhetorical questions to achieve this, such as, "But how likely is that?" and "how many communist Marines have you ever heard of?"

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to strengthen its claims and dismiss opposing views. For example, "A blind man could see what was happening" exaggerates the obviousness of the author's conclusion, and calling the official explanation "laughable" minimizes its credibility.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism to build support. Instead, it critiques national institutions like the CIA and questions the official use of terms like "national security."

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses words with strong emotional connotations to influence the reader's opinion. Examples include "cover-up," "incriminating circumstantial evidence," "ludicrous notion," and "patsy."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by associating it with Nazis or other groups widely hated by the audience.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to popularity. In fact, it does the opposite by positioning itself against the "mainstream media" and arguing for a non-conformist, independent mindset.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a series of complex events. It posits that a single, secret "deal" between Trump and the CIA is the reason for the continued secrecy of the files and will also be the cause for the "fizzling out" of the Russia investigation.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's writing style is direct and assertive, not intentionally vague. The text accuses the CIA of obfuscation but does not use the technique itself.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the author's own previous articles and refers to Douglas Horne, who "served on the staff of the Assassination Records Review Board," to lend credibility to its arguments.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: the "ridiculous and illogical" official story of a lone gunman, or the author's theory of a CIA regime-change operation. It frames the CIA's position as being "between a rock and a hard place," offering only two extreme outcomes.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that present its conclusions as self-evident and discourage further questioning. Examples include, "Let’s state the obvious" and "One thing is for sure and undeniable."

Red herring – No – The text remains highly focused on its central thesis about the JFK assassination cover-up. Other topics, like the Russia investigation, are not introduced as distractions but are integrated directly into the main conspiracy theory.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the position of its opponents to make them easier to attack. It characterizes the "mainstream media" as being "forever wedded to the official story no matter how ridiculous and illogical it is," creating a simplified and easily refutable caricature of a diverse group.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not use hypocrisy as a defense or a way to deflect criticism. It stays on the offensive, attacking the credibility of others without using the "what about you" tactic.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a balanced or objective analysis but a highly persuasive piece designed to convince the reader of a specific conspiracy theory. This is achieved through the heavy use of numerous propaganda techniques. The author systematically attempts to discredit all official and mainstream sources by casting doubt, using loaded language, and employing name-calling. The argument is built on a black-and-white fallacy, forcing a choice between the "ridiculous" official story and the author's supposedly obvious alternative. This alternative is itself a causal oversimplification, where a secret "deal" neatly explains multiple complex political events. The author appeals to their own authority and that of allied figures while using thought-terminating clichés to present their conclusions as undeniable, thereby discouraging critical thought. The consistent and combined use of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to persuade and indoctrinate rather than to inform neutrally.
