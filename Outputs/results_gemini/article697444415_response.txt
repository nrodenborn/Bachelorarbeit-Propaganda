4. Appeal to fear – No – The text describes a fearful event, but it does not use fear of an alternative idea to promote its own.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text is constructed to make the reader question the official narrative of the Las Vegas shooting. Explanation: The entire piece is framed to question the official story, with lines like, "...the FBI is actively covering this up," and "...the growing belief that we are not being told what actually happened that fateful night."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of one person's testimony to present it as conclusive proof. Explanation: The testimony is described with exaggerated importance using phrases like, "This stunning testimony is obviously a huge bombshell in the ongoing investigation..."

7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's perception.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between only two options: the official story (which is implied to be a lie) and the "truth" of a cover-up.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion.

16. Red herring – No – The material presented, such as the locked gates, is directly relevant to the central claim of a conspiracy, not a distraction.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform objectively but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, unsubstantiated viewpoint—namely, that there was a conspiracy and cover-up related to the Las Vegas shooting. It achieves this by heavily relying on a combination of propaganda techniques. The entire article is built on an **Appeal to Authority** (the victim's testimony) and uses this as a foundation to sow **Doubt** about the official investigation. It employs emotionally **Loaded Language** ("shocking," "bombshell") and **Exaggeration** to amplify the impact of this single account. Furthermore, it uses the **Bandwagon** technique by suggesting this alternative theory is a "growing belief," and presents a **Black & White Fallacy** where the only options are the "official lie" and the "hidden truth." The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions and perceptions rather than to engage in factual, balanced reporting.
