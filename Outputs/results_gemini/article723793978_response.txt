1. Name calling – No – The text describes the Sweden Democrats as "populist, opposition" which is a political description, not an insulting label. No other name-calling is present.
2. Repetition – No – The message is presented once without significant repetition within the text.
3. Slogans – No – While the blog's title "America's Immigration Voice" could be a slogan for the organization, no slogans are used as a persuasive device within the body of the text itself.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text focuses on frightening events to create anxiety. Example: "Four people were shot dead in the first week of this year. One man died after picking up a hand grenade outside a subway station..."
5. Doubt – No – The text does not directly question the credibility of any specific person or source; in fact, it uses sources to build its own credibility.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The sarcastic quote from Jimmie Akesson exaggerates the situation to make a rhetorical point. Example: "This is the new Sweden; the new, exciting dynamic, multicultural paradise that so many here in this assembly … have fought to create for so many years."
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism for either Sweden or America.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text strongly implies a simple, single cause (immigration) for a complex problem (gang violence). Example: "...the populist, opposition Sweden Democrats linking public concern about the rising crime rate to a large increase in the numbers of immigrants."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in the point it is trying to make.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the credibility of a news organization and a political figure to support its claims. Example: "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) – Sweden will do whatever it takes... Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said..."
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present the issue as a choice between only two options.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author adds a short, simplistic phrase that discourages further critical thought. Example: "That’s crazy."

***

Verdict – 90% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it is built around a factual article from a legitimate news source (Reuters), its purpose as propaganda comes from its framing, selection, and presentation by the blog "America's Immigration Voice." The blog's title itself reveals a clear political agenda.

The piece functions as propaganda by carefully selecting a story from another country to serve as a cautionary tale for its domestic audience. It uses an **Appeal to authority** (citing Reuters) to establish a baseline of credibility. It then heavily employs **Appeal to fear** by focusing on the most shocking details of the story, such as "deadly shootings" and "hand grenades." This is amplified by the **Causal Oversimplification** that links this complex crime issue directly and solely to immigration, a point explicitly made by the quoted Sweden Democrat leader. His sarcastic and emotional statement is a clear example of **Loaded Language**. Finally, the blog adds its own commentary ("That’s crazy") which acts as a **Thought-terminating cliché**, encouraging a simple emotional reaction over a nuanced analysis of the situation. The combination of these techniques to selectively frame information and guide the audience to a specific, fear-based conclusion about immigration makes this a strong example of propaganda.
