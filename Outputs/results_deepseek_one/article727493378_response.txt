Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No direct insulting labels are applied to the coroner or office (e.g., "corrupt," "incompetent"). Criticism is implied but not overtly insulting.
2.  **Repetition** – No – While the delay is mentioned several times, the *exact same phrase or message* isn't hammered repetitively. The focus is on different aspects of the delay and refusal.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There is no distinct, standalone, memorable phrase used as a rallying cry. "Release the records" and "No more games" are demands but lack the crafted brevity and memorability of a true slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text expresses suspicion and frustration, but it doesn't explicitly try to instill fear about the consequences of *not* releasing the report (e.g., "cover-up will lead to more deaths").
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The text actively questions the credibility of the coroner's actions and motives. Example: "Seriously, it's been four months already!... How can the autopsy report not be ‘finalized’ when the body was cremated more than five weeks ago?" and "Wait, were the same guys in the autopsy room that were there when the doctors and coroners examined John F Kennedy?" and "we have questions as to whether the body was even that of Stephen Paddock".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – The phrase "Something is rotten in Denmark!" is a strong, Shakespearean allusion implying deep, systemic corruption within the coroner's office or investigation, which is a significant exaggeration based on the presented facts (delayed report, legal battle).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no explicit appeal to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty like "American values" or "We the People" in this context.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to frame the situation negatively: "defy a court order," "determined to not release," "Seriously, it's been four months already!", "remains in a box marked 'evidence'", "No more games," "Something is rotten in Denmark!", "problematic," "fought to keep... confidential".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – The reference to the JFK autopsy ("Wait, were the same guys in the autopsy room that were there when the doctors and coroners examined John F Kennedy?") implicitly compares the potential mishandling or cover-up in this case to one of the most famous and controversial autopsies in US history, invoking suspicion and distrust associated with that event.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text doesn't argue that the report should be released because it's popular or that "everyone" wants it. It argues based on legal rights and public interest.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The complexity of the investigation or report finalization isn't reduced to a single, simple cause. The text implies malfeasance but doesn't explicitly state a single simplistic reason *for* the delay beyond incompetence or concealment.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is actually trying to *clarify* and demand specifics. It accuses the coroner of delay and obfuscation but doesn't engage in it itself. The "certain elements... apparently at odds" is vague but serves to raise doubt rather than confuse the audience about the author's point.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text extensively quotes and relies on statements from Las Vegas attorney Maggie McLetchie and Review-Journal Editor-in-Chief Keith Moyer to support its arguments about the illegitimacy of the delay and the public's right to know. Example: "“The court correctly recognized the presumption of public access to records...", "The law is squarely on the side of the public’s right to open government.”, "That's exactly right!".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – The text frames the situation as a simple binary: the coroner is either obeying the court order and releasing the report immediately ("Release the records," "No more games") or he is defying it and engaging in delay tactics/concealment. It dismisses the coroner's stated reason ("finalized") as invalid and doesn't acknowledge potential legitimate complexities.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – While phrases like "Something is rotten in Denmark!" and "No more games" are strong, they don't function to *stop* discussion; they are used to *provoke* further questioning and demand action. The text encourages critical thought about the situation.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Introducing the speculative question about the JFK autopsy personnel ("Wait, were the same guys...") and the even more speculative doubt about the body's identity ("we have questions as to whether the body was even that of Stephen Paddock") are irrelevant distractions from the core legal issue of releasing the autopsy report under the court order. They serve only to inflame suspicion without evidence.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text accurately reports the coroner's stated position (report not "finalized") and argues against that. It doesn't misrepresent his argument into an easier-to-refute position.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not accuse the coroner or others of hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions in a different context. The JFK reference is an analogy/suspicion, not a charge of hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 45% –** The text exhibits several clear propaganda techniques (Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Reduction ad Hitlerum, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Red Herring). It uses emotionally charged language, raises unsubstantiated suspicions (JFK, body identity), exaggerates the implication ("rotten in Denmark"), frames the issue simplistically, and uses quotes from authorities to bolster its argument while dismissing the coroner's position. However, it is anchored in factual events (the court order, the cremation date, the legal costs, the lawyer's statements) and focuses on a specific issue of government transparency and adherence to a court order. It functions more as strongly opinionated, advocacy journalism with significant propagandistic elements (particularly in its framing and speculative tangents) than pure, baseless propaganda. Its core demand (release the report per the court order) has a legitimate basis, even if the methods of arguing for it employ propaganda techniques.
