Based on the definitions provided and the text analysis, here is the breakdown for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Pope Francis dismisses protesters against Bishop Barros as "lefties" ("dismissing the protesters as 'lefties'").
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message is not repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – The text reports facts and events; no brief, memorable persuasive phrases are used.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the topic (sexual abuse) is inherently serious, the text reports on actions and criticisms without using fear to promote a specific alternative solution.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The text questions the effectiveness and commitment of the commission and the Pope (e.g., "Was the pope listening to the commission? Possibly not."; "Commission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness..."; "He said the group was a toothless, paper-shuffling exercise"; "Vatican bureaucrats had refused to comply...").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text reports facts, criticisms, and setbacks (like the tribunal failing) without apparent exaggeration or minimization beyond descriptive language (e.g., "predator priests" is descriptive context).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or national/group identity to support an argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Terms like "predator priests," "dogged," "toothless, paper-shuffling exercise," "emboldened," and "molesters and rapists" carry strong negative connotations and appeal to emotion.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No disapproval is linked by suggesting an idea is popular with hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea as a reason to accept it.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text presents the complexity of the issue (e.g., discussions on why the tribunal failed, cultural challenges, bureaucratic resistance) without attributing the problem to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text aims to clarify events and actions (e.g., explaining why the tribunal failed, what the commission did/didn't achieve). The Vatican declining to name abuse victims is presented as respecting privacy, not deliberate obfuscation.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While authorities (Pope, Cardinals, Commission) are cited, their statements or positions are reported as facts or actions within the narrative, not used as primary evidence to persuade the audience of a specific claim.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents nuances, complexities, and different perspectives (e.g., the commission's achievements vs. failures, the Pope's initial stance vs. later action on Barros, differing views on reporting obligations).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used that shut down critical thought or discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the commission, its history, challenges, and the Pope's actions related to abuse handling. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text addresses actual criticisms and events (e.g., commission members resigning due to perceived ineffectiveness, Vatican bureaucracy resisting, the Pope's dismissal of protesters and support for Barros). It does not refute misrepresented arguments.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are made by deflecting criticism with accusations against the critic.

**Verdict – 20% –** The text is primarily a factual news report detailing the history, challenges, and reboot of Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission. It presents information, criticisms, and actions from multiple sources (the Vatican, commission members, critics, victims). While it uses some **Loaded Language** (common in journalism on sensitive topics) and reports instances of **Name calling** (the Pope's "lefties" remark) and raises **Doubt** about the commission's effectiveness and the Pope's attentiveness, these elements serve the reporting function rather than constituting a systematic attempt to manipulate the audience towards a specific, predetermined conclusion. The overall tone is informative and critical, not overtly persuasive in the manner of propaganda. The 20% reflects the presence of the minor techniques identified, but the core purpose remains journalistic reporting.
