15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Are they for real?" shuts down critical analysis of official statements.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Opens with barred reporters (Laura Loomer/Mike Tokes) to distract from the core investigation.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Systematic Technique Use**: 13/18 techniques are deployed (e.g., repetition, loaded language, fear appeals) to manipulate emotion and distrust.  
2. **Narrative Framing**: Positions authorities (FBI, police) as incompetent or deceitful by emphasizing inconsistencies without evidence of malice.  
3. **Conspiracy Reinforcement**: Highlights discrepancies (e.g., timeline changes) to imply a cover-up while offering no proof beyond speculation.  
4. **Source Bias**: Posted with permission from Pamela Geller, a known conspiracy theorist, signaling ideological alignment.  
5. **Rhetorical Tactics**: Uses rhetorical questions ("Are they for real?") and emotionally charged language ("meticulously planned attack") to bypass rational analysis.  
6. **Omission of Context**: Fails to acknowledge common investigational complexities in mass shootings (e.g., evolving timelines).  

While it reports genuine discrepancies, the text’s selective focus, inflammatory tone, and technique density reveal an intent to delegitimize authorities rather than inform. The 5% uncertainty stems from the inclusion of factual sources (WaPo, Legal Insurrection), though these are weaponized to serve the propagandistic narrative.
