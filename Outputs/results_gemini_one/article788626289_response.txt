1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Keith Ellison as "Muslim Brotherhood Congressman Hakim Muhammad, aka Keith Ellison," using his birth name and an association with the Muslim Brotherhood as an insulting label.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times in a row.
3. Slogans – No – The text references the slogan "#MeToo rhetoric" to criticize it, but does not use a slogan to promote its own message.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear in the reader about an alternative idea; its focus is on accusing opponents of hypocrisy.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text aims to cast doubt on the Democratic party's sincerity by stating, "all their #MeToo rhetoric is pure politically-motivated hypocrisy — as if anyone didn’t know that by now."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the evidence in one case while minimizing it in another: "There is abundant evidence that Karen Monahan is telling the truth... By contrast, there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Brett Kavanaugh abused Christine Blasey Ford."
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use patriotic appeals or symbols.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases such as "in a lather" and "pure politically-motivated hypocrisy" to influence the reader's emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text makes no comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text uses the phrase "as if anyone didn’t know that by now," which suggests that the author's conclusion is already a widely accepted fact that everyone should agree with.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text asserts that the Democrats' differing responses to the two cases are caused solely by "pure politically-motivated hypocrisy," reducing a complex political situation to a single, simple cause.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and is not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites a "doctor’s report" as key evidence to support its claims: "The ex-girlfriend accusing Democratic Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison of domestic abuse told her doctor in 2017 about alleged 'emotional and physical abuse' from Ellison, according to a document the woman published Wednesday."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the two abuse allegations in absolute terms, as one having "abundant evidence" and the other having "absolutely no evidence whatsoever," presenting only two extreme options rather than a nuanced view of the evidence in either case.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "as if anyone didn’t know that by now" is used to dismiss the need for further discussion or critical thought by asserting the conclusion is obvious.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text includes a poll, "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?," which is completely irrelevant to the article's topic and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – No – The text primarily engages in a direct accusation of hypocrisy rather than misrepresenting and refuting a specific argument from its opponents.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The entire premise of the introductory paragraphs is to charge the Democratic party with hypocrisy by deflecting from the Kavanaugh case to the Ellison case: "But while the Democrats are in a lather over Ford and Kavanaugh... they couldn’t care less about Karen Monahan."

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a neutral report but a highly persuasive piece designed to attack a political group. Its central argument is a textbook example of **Whataboutism**, deflecting from one issue to charge an opponent with hypocrisy on another. It heavily employs emotional manipulation through **Name-calling** ("Muslim Brotherhood Congressman") and **Loaded Language** ("in a lather," "pure...hypocrisy"). The argument is built on a **Black & White Fallacy** and **Exaggeration**, presenting the evidence in two separate cases as absolute opposites ("abundant" vs. "absolutely no evidence whatsoever") to support its claim of hypocrisy. It uses techniques like **Appeal to Authority** (the doctor's report) to bolster its preferred narrative while simultaneously using a **Thought-terminating cliché** ("as if anyone didn’t know that by now") to discourage dissent. The inclusion of a completely unrelated poll serves as a blatant **Red Herring**. The combination and high density of these techniques show a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than to inform them objectively.
