Here is the analysis of the text according to each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against the subjects (the ritual practitioners or the government).
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message about the ritual and the plague is stated but not excessively repeated in a mantra-like fashion.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans. "Dancing with corpses" is descriptive, not a crafted slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the deadliness and airborne nature of the plague and directly links it to the ritual, instilling fear about the consequences of the practice. *Example:* "Since it’s airborne, anyone coming close to the corpse... could themselves, catch the infection."
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – Locals quoted in the text actively question the credibility of the government and the existence/severity of the plague. *Example:* "Josephine Ralisiarisoa firmly believes the country’s cash-strapped government is just exaggerating the problem..." and "The plague is a lie".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Locals quoted minimize the threat of the plague and the risk associated with the ritual. *Example:* "I have participated in at least 15 famadihana ceremonies in my life. And I’ve never caught the plague."
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or national/group identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – The phrase "dancing with corpses" is emotionally charged and evokes strong, negative imagery. It frames the traditional ritual in a macabre and potentially disrespectful light. *Example:* The headline and repeated use of "dancing with corpses".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt is made to link ideas or practices to universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal is made to the popularity of either the health warnings or the ritual practice to persuade.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text strongly implies the ritual ("famadihana") is a *major* cause of the outbreak, potentially oversimplifying the complex factors involved in a plague epidemic (e.g., poverty, healthcare access, rodent populations, other transmission routes). *Example:* "The local tradition is said to be one of the major causes of the spread of this disease."
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The language used is relatively clear and direct.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites health officials (Willy Randriamarotia) to support the claim that the ritual is dangerous. *Example:* "Willy Randriamarotia, Madagascar’s health ministry chief of staff" explains the transmission risk from handling bodies.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents the health officials' warnings and the locals' skepticism/denial. It doesn't frame the situation as only having two possible choices or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used that inherently shut down critical discussion. The quotes from locals are arguments, not clichés designed to stop thought.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The introduction of the conspiracy theory about the government lying for money distracts from the core health issue and the scientific explanation of transmission. *Example:* "Josephine Ralisiarisoa firmly believes the country’s cash-strapped government is just exaggerating the problem to get money ahead of an election next year."
17. **Straw men** – No – The arguments presented (health warnings vs. conspiracy/minimization) are reported directly. No misrepresented arguments are set up to be knocked down.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are made by either side within the reported text.

**Verdict – 40% –** The text reports on a real health crisis and includes factual statements from health officials and direct quotes from locals expressing skepticism. However, it employs several propaganda techniques: **Appeal to Fear** (vividly describing the plague danger linked to the ritual), **Doubt** (highlighting locals questioning the government/plague), **Minimization** (quoting locals downplaying the risk), **Loaded Language** (using the emotionally charged "dancing with corpses"), **Causal Oversimplification** (strongly implying the ritual is a major cause), and **Red Herring** (including the distracting conspiracy theory). These techniques, especially the loaded language framing and the focus on the controversial ritual alongside the conspiracy theory, serve to sensationalize the story and potentially manipulate the reader's emotional response and perception of the locals' practices and the government's motives. While based on real events and quotes, the selection and framing lean towards propaganda. The percentage reflects a significant use of manipulative techniques within a factual reporting structure.
