### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements, primarily through Orbán’s rhetoric. Techniques like *appeal to fear*, *loaded language*, *flag-waving*, *name-calling*, and *bandwagon* dominate, framing migration as an apocalyptic threat while promoting nationalism and vilifying opponents (e.g., Soros, Western leaders). The article itself is a Reuters report, not propaganda, but it quotes Orbán’s statements, which are manipulative and emotionally charged. His messaging simplifies complex issues (e.g., blaming "globalism" for societal problems), uses divisive us-vs-them narratives, and leverages election timing to rally support. However, the inclusion of factual context (e.g., poll numbers, policy details) slightly mitigates the score. Overall, Orbán’s quotes align with propaganda aims: influencing public opinion by exploiting fears and identity politics.
