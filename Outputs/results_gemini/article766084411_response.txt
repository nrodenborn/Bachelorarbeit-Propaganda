1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack political opponents, such as "Leftists" and "Progressives" in a pejorative context, and refers to undocumented immigrants as "illegals." For example: "...yet another issue Progressives are trying to undermine progress being done by the president."

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the exact same poll question three times in a row to reinforce a message. For example: "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is listed three consecutive times.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not employ brief, memorable phrases as slogans to be repeated or adopted by the audience.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text attempts to instill fear by suggesting a massive, secret government plan to handle millions of incoming people, linking it to military exercises and land grabs. For example: "Since Obama planned to have over a million Muslim refugees brought into the US over a short period of time... one can understand the reason the Feds had to have the Walmart stores and so much land..."

5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively works to create doubt about the statements of the government and the familial relationships of immigrants. For example: "Since no one can know if the children really belong to the illegals who say they are their parents, they are separated until that can be verified..."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates numbers and connections while minimizing policy differences. For example, it makes the unsubstantiated claim that the government underreports immigrant numbers by a specific, large factor: "...the Feds downplay the actual number which always ends up to be more than quadruple their stated number."

7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use appeals to patriotism, national pride, or patriotic symbols to make its case.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses words with strong emotional connotations to influence the audience's perception. For example: "What we seem to have here... is some very good actors on the Left accusing the Trump Administration of being cruel and insensitive..."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any idea or group to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea; instead, it presents a conspiratorial viewpoint suggesting "what many do not realize," appealing to a sense of being privy to secret knowledge rather than joining a majority.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex issue of immigration policy to a single, overarching secret plan dating back to the Jade Helm exercises. For example: "The bottom line is, both the Left and the Trump Administration seem to be following along with a plan of action going back to Jade Helm..."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague and unclear language to imply connections without providing concrete evidence. For example: "This, along with the federal government grab of millions of acres of land during the Obama years, speaks volumes in the government's plan to be able to handle millions of people."

13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does not cite any experts, respected institutions, or authority figures to support its claims.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by suggesting the only alternative to the current situation is immediate deportation, ignoring all other potential policy solutions. For example: "If they were, there would be no detention and separation after illegally coming into the US, only an immediate deportation by US Border Patrol on the spot."

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that discourage critical thought, such as presenting its conclusion as the definitive, non-negotiable truth. For example: "The bottom line is, both the Left and the Trump Administration seem to be following along with a plan..."

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces an irrelevant poll designed to distract the reader and poison the well against a political party. For example: The poll "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" has no direct relevance to the article's argument about immigration policy.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the argument against the Trump administration's family separation policy, framing it simply as a complaint that the policy was "new," thereby ignoring the more substantive criticisms about its "zero tolerance" nature and intent. For example: "Thus, the idea that separating children from their parents as being something new, done only by the Trump Administration is absurd..."

18. Whataboutism – Yes – A core strategy of the text is to deflect criticism of one administration by pointing to the alleged actions of a previous one. For example: "When in fact, their idol, Obama did the same thing for years during his time in power."

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is an unambiguous piece of propaganda. It employs a remarkable number of propaganda techniques (14 out of the 18 listed) to promote a specific, conspiratorial narrative. Rather than presenting a factual, nuanced argument, its primary goal is to persuade the reader through emotional manipulation, logical fallacies, and the distortion of information.

The piece systematically uses techniques like **Whataboutism**, **Straw Men**, and **Name Calling** to frame the political debate in a way that discredits one side ("Leftists," "Progressives") while deflecting criticism from another. It builds its central argument on a foundation of **Causal Oversimplification** and **Exaggeration**, linking complex immigration policies to a single, sinister military exercise (Jade Helm). This narrative is bolstered by **Appeals to Fear** (mentioning millions of refugees) and **Doubt** (questioning official information and immigrants' family ties).

Furthermore, the inclusion of a completely irrelevant **Red Herring** poll and the use of **Loaded Language** throughout the text demonstrate a clear intent to manipulate the reader's emotions rather than inform their intellect. The combination of so many distinct propaganda methods in a single article confirms that its purpose is not journalism or objective analysis, but persuasion aimed at fostering distrust and advancing a partisan, conspiratorial worldview.
