Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "national disgrace" (used to describe migrants climbing the fence).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The Jim Acosta poll question ("Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?") is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "Border security is national security" (memorable phrase used by Kirstjen Nielsen).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "illegally entering America" and framing the caravan as a threat requiring military resources, implying danger to national security.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No explicit questioning of credibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "climbing effortlessly" exaggerates ease; "national disgrace" exaggerates severity.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "Border security is national security" ties border enforcement to patriotism.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "illegally entering," "national disgrace," "deploy resources to safely secure" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified cause-effect claims.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Language is direct.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Quotes from CBP and Kirstjen Nielsen ("Securing ports of entry") used as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomy presented.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "national disgrace" shuts down nuanced discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The Jim Acosta poll is irrelevant to the migrant caravan story.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy.  

**Verdict – 60%** – The text contains multiple propaganda techniques (e.g., loaded language, appeal to fear, flag-waving) through emotionally charged phrasing ("illegally," "national disgrace"), repetition of an unrelated poll, and authoritative quotes framing border crossings as a security threat. However, it also includes factual reporting (e.g., describing migrant actions, CBP deployments) and cites sources (Fox 5, official tweets). The inclusion of the irrelevant Jim Acosta poll and opinion-driven tweets (e.g., Charlie Kirk's) shifts it toward propaganda by distracting from objective reporting and amplifying a fear-based narrative. While not purely propaganda, its selective framing and persuasive elements serve a clear agenda.
