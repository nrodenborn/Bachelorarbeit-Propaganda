Name calling – Yes – The text labels the federal government's system as a "prison for profit system" and the charges against the Hammonds as "unmitigated 'terrorism' charges," which are insulting labels used to attack the subject.

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses on injustice and appeals to empathy rather than instilling fear about alternatives to pardoning the ranchers.

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the justice system by repeatedly calling the verdict a "miscarriage of justice" and questioning the application of "terrorism" charges.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the act of setting fires as simply "doing what ranchers do, setting fires to protect property and livestock," downplaying the potential illegality of arson on federal land.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the identity of a specific group, the "Rural communities of the West," to garner support and create a sense of shared identity against the federal government.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "murder of LaVoy Finicum," "gross miscarriage of justice," and "humble ranchers" to appeal to the reader's emotions.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text states, "many who have seen what took place... are calling on President Donald Trump to issue a pardon," suggesting that the idea is already popular and the reader should join in.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text claims the Hammonds went to jail simply for "doing what ranchers do, setting fires to protect property and livestock," which is a simple explanation for a complex legal case involving federal arson laws.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its accusations and its call to action, not deliberately obscure.

Appeal to authority – No – While it quotes a petition, the petition itself is the subject of the article, not an independent authority being used as evidence to support a claim.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the Hammonds as either "terrorists" or "hard-working, family ranchers," presenting only two extreme options and ignoring any middle ground or legal nuance.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "doing what ranchers do" is used to shut down critical thought about the legality and nature of the fires, presenting the action as a simple, normal activity that requires no further examination.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a completely irrelevant poll asking, "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" which serves only to distract the reader from the topic of the ranchers.

Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the argument that the Hammonds are terrorists ("They are the furthest thing from terrorists"), a characterization that is easy to knock down, to avoid engaging with the more complex legal arguments for their conviction.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge an opponent with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly a piece of propaganda. It employs a multitude of propaganda techniques aimed at manipulating the reader's emotions and perspective rather than providing a balanced, factual account. It uses loaded language ("murder," "miscarriage of justice"), name-calling ("prison for profit system"), and a black & white fallacy to frame the issue in a highly emotional and simplistic way. It distracts the reader with a completely irrelevant red herring (the poll about Democrats) and uses bandwagon appeals ("many are calling on...") to create a sense of popular momentum. The entire piece is structured not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint and take a specific action (signing the petition) based on a one-sided and emotionally charged narrative.
