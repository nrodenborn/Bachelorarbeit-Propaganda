1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to those opposing Kavanaugh as a "political lynch mob out for blood."

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively.

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a traditional slogan.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The title, "If Kavanaugh Is Not Confirmed By Senate, Then We Are All Just One Accusation Away From Ruin," directly instills fear in the reader about the consequences of not confirming the nominee.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire text is structured to cast doubt on Christine Ford's credibility, particularly through the hypothetical cross-examination and the question, "If this had been such a pivotal moment for her, how could she have forgotten any those facts?"

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the potential outcome with the word "Ruin" in the title. It also minimizes the alleged event by suggesting, "Kavanaugh may have made a pass at her as 17-year-old boys (and even some 17-year-old girls) are known to do."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national concern with quotes like Jeanine Pirro's "I fear for this nation" and Hannity's reference to foundational American principles like "due process, equal justice under the law."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases such as "political lynch mob out for blood," "smeared on the national stage," and describes Ford's supporters as poised to "scatter like mice."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest that the ideas it opposes are popular with hated groups like Nazis or other extremist factions.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text primarily uses appeals to specific authorities rather than suggesting an idea is good simply because it is popular with the general public.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex situation by attributing the timing of the accusation primarily to a single cause: "Democrats want to delay this vote until after the midterms because they believe they have a chance to retake the Senate as well as the House."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its viewpoint and arguments; it does not use intentionally obscure or confusing language.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly cites conservative figures like Ben Shapiro, Jeanine Pirro, Rush Limbaugh, and Gregg Jarrett as authorities to validate its arguments.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The title presents a false dichotomy: either Kavanaugh is confirmed, or "We Are All Just One Accusation Away From Ruin," ignoring other potential outcomes or interpretations.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that dismiss counter-arguments without engaging them, such as Gregg Jarrett's claim that opponents have "lost their common sense," which discourages a deeper look into their motivations.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text includes a poll, "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?," which is completely irrelevant to the topic of the Kavanaugh confirmation and serves as a distraction.

17. Straw men – Yes – The hypothetical cross-examination creates a weak and uncertain version of Christine Ford's testimony, which the author then easily refutes by stating, "No jury would send a young man to prison based on that testimony." This attacks a fabricated, weak argument rather than her actual claims.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text includes Jeanine Pirro's quote, "You believe any woman who goes against a Republican and you don't believe any woman who goes against a Democrat," which accuses the opposition of hypocrisy to deflect from the issue at hand.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, one-sided viewpoint by employing a wide array of manipulative techniques. The article utilizes a majority of the listed propaganda methods, including a powerful appeal to fear in its title, consistent use of loaded language ("lynch mob," "smear") to evoke emotion, and a heavy reliance on appeals to authority by quoting exclusively from commentators who support its position. It actively casts doubt on the accuser through a fabricated "straw man" cross-examination and simplifies the complex motivations behind the events into a simple political ploy (causal oversimplification). A non-propagandistic piece would present facts more neutrally, include perspectives from both sides, avoid emotionally charged language, and refrain from introducing irrelevant distractions like the poll. The text's structure and content are fundamentally designed for persuasion through emotional and logical manipulation, which is the essence of propaganda.
