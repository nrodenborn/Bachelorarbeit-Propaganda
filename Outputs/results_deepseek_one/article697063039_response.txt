Here's the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to any subject.
2.  **Repetition** – No – While facts about the crisis are repeated (lack of power/water, devastation), it's not the *same message* repeated obsessively; it's reporting on different aspects or updates.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to encapsulate a position or call to action.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the situation described is inherently frightening (lack of water/power, economy standstill, survival difficult), the text presents it as factual reporting of the disaster's consequences, not primarily to instill fear *in support of a specific idea or action*. The fear is a consequence of the facts presented, not the *technique* used.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The credibility of any person, group, or statement is not directly questioned.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The descriptions ("devastated," "all but completely destroyed," "standstill," "survival will get more difficult") are strong but contextually appropriate given the scale of the disaster reported. Specific statistics (10%, 84%, 90%, $4.6B, $29B, 6 months) are provided and attributed.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or national identity to support a position.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like "devastated," "wrath," "struggling," "devastating news," "hurricane-ravaged," "survival will get more difficult," "standstill," "isolated" carry strong negative emotional connotations. While describing a real disaster, the consistent use of highly charged language aims to evoke a strong emotional response (sympathy, outrage) in the reader. *Example: "This is devastating news for those living in Puerto Rico"*
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or other universally despised groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea to encourage acceptance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The causes of the ongoing crisis (hurricane destruction, slow recovery, Jones Act waiver expiration) are presented as complex and multi-faceted, not reduced to a single, simplistic cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text uses specific details, statistics, quotes, and clear descriptions. It is not deliberately unclear or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While Governor Rosselló and officials are quoted providing context and justification for the aid request, their statements are presented as part of the reporting on the situation and the government's response, not primarily as unquestionable proof to validate the *article's* core message. The article doesn't rely on "because X said so" as its main argument.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents the complex realities and challenges of the situation. It does not frame the issue as having only two possible choices or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No simplistic phrases are used to shut down critical thinking or discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the situation in Puerto Rico, the impact of the hurricane, the recovery efforts, and the consequences of policy decisions (Jones Act). It does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that hasn't actually been made.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No charges of hypocrisy are leveled against any opponent.

**Verdict – 10% –** The text primarily functions as **factual disaster reporting**, heavily utilizing statistics, quotes from officials, and specific details about the situation (power outages, water access, aid requests, policy decisions like the Jones Act). While it employs **Loaded Language** to convey the severity and evoke an emotional response (which is common in reporting on humanitarian crises), this is the *only* technique clearly present. The core purpose appears to be informing about the scale of the disaster and the challenges faced, rather than systematically deploying multiple propaganda techniques to promote a specific agenda or distort reality. The strong language is consistent with the reported facts of a major catastrophe, not a clear indicator of propagandistic intent by itself. The overwhelming majority of the techniques are absent. Therefore, it's classified as news reporting with a strong emotional tone, not primarily propaganda. The 10% reflects the presence of loaded language.
