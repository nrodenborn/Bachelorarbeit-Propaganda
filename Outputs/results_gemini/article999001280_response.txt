1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels such as "Self Proclaimed 'Fact Checkers'", "drive-by media", "Communist teeth", and "Clown News Network" to attack the media and its personalities.

2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times consecutively. The accusation that various people and outlets are "lying" is also repeated throughout the text.

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable, and insulting phrases like "Clown News Network" to create a negative association with the subject.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text asks, "If they're prepared to lie this shamelessly, what else are they lying about?" This is designed to instill fear and distrust in the reader regarding all information from mainstream media sources.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is an exercise in casting doubt on the credibility of CNN, Jim Acosta, Snopes, MediaBiasFactCheck.com, and NewsGuard, stating for instance that "MBFC isn't qualified to comment on the subject."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the alteration of the video by calling it "enhanced, not doctored," while exaggerating the media's reporting on it as a "blatant conspiracy to smear President Trump."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a national identity by stating that Anderson Cooper let Jim Acosta "lie to the American people," framing the issue as an offense against the entire nation.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as "gunned down," "lying through their Communist teeth," "shamelessly," and "blatant lie," to evoke strong negative feelings in the reader.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of the media by associating them with a group hated by the target audience, specifically in the phrase "lying through their Communist teeth."

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text implies that many people agree with its viewpoint ("Yep, I noticed too") and cites that "President Trump backed him up," encouraging readers to join a popular or powerful side.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex media coverage of the Jim Acosta incident to a single, simple cause: a deliberate "conspiracy to smear President Trump," ignoring other potential factors like differing journalistic interpretations or standards.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; it is direct and aggressive in its accusations. Its language is intended to be inflammatory, not obscure.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses President Trump's support as evidence ("President Trump backed him up on his comments") and presents C-SPAN as a "neutral" authority to bolster its claims.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice: either you believe Infowars and the author's interpretation, or you are siding with the "lying" media. The poll also presents limited, loaded options: "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass."

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses dismissive phrases like "Yeah, right!" and "I'm sorry Jim, I can't hear you over the booming voice of your hypocrisy!" to shut down counter-arguments and end discussion.

16. Red herring – Yes – The author introduces their personal legal battle with MediaBiasFactCheck.com ("I had to have my attorneys send a letter for their libel"), which is irrelevant to the Acosta video but serves to distract and discredit fact-checkers in general.

17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes the argument that the video was "doctored" by narrowly defining the term, while the actual criticism from media outlets was often more nuanced, focusing on the misleading effect of speeding up the footage. This refutes a simplified version of the opposition's argument.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects criticism of Infowars and PJW by charging the media with hypocrisy, culminating in the line: "I'm sorry Jim, I can't hear you over the booming voice of your hypocrisy!"

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint of the mainstream media and entities labeled as "fact-checkers." The article employs a vast majority (17 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques, often using several in a single sentence. It relies heavily on emotional manipulation through loaded language, name-calling, and appeals to fear. Rather than presenting a balanced view or engaging with counterarguments in good faith, it creates a simple narrative of good versus evil, using techniques like the black & white fallacy, straw men, and whataboutism to discredit any opposing view. The goal is to solidify an "us vs. them" mentality and erode trust in established sources of information, which is a core function of modern propaganda.
