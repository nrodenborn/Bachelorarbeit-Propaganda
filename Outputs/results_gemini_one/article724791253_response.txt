1. Name calling – Yes – Explanation: The text labels the council's action as a "ridiculous exercise in virtue-signaling" and quotes a description of the anti-Trump motion as a "farce". It also refers to a former mayor as an "Islamist mayor".

2. Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The text repeatedly contrasts the banning of the author and Pamela Geller with the admission of multiple "jihad preachers," reinforcing the central message of UK hypocrisy through a series of different examples.

3. Slogans – No – Explanation: The text is a long-form article and does not employ its own brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Explanation: The text quotes Shaykh Hamza Sodagar's graphic descriptions of punishments for homosexuals ("chop their head off... burn them to death") to instill fear about the types of individuals the UK government allegedly admits into the country.

5. Doubt – Yes – Explanation: The text questions the credibility of the Tower Hamlets council by stating it "has been at the centre of serious corruption scandals, including the removal of an Islamist mayor who was found guilty of bribing Muslim groups".

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: The author minimizes the potential controversy of their own views by stating they were banned for the "crime of telling the truth about Islam and jihad," framing a complex issue in a self-serving and simplistic way.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Explanation: The entire argument is framed around "Britain’s hypocrisy and double standards," appealing to a sense of national identity and what the country's principles should be.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: The text is filled with emotionally charged phrases such as "jihad preachers," "preaching of hatred," "relentlessly appeasement-minded government," and "ridiculous exercise in virtue-signaling" to influence the reader's emotions.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – Explanation: The text quotes a Conservative councillor who discredits the opposition by noting that one of their previous candidates had tweeted, "let us support Hitler the Great."

10. Bandwagon – Yes – Explanation: The text notes that the council's motion points out that "the neighbouring Royal Borough of Greenwich formally adopted a similar motion," using the action of another group to support its own.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: The text suggests that the reason the author is banned while extremists are not is simply due to "Britain’s hypocrisy," reducing complex immigration and national security decisions to a single, simple cause.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanation: The text is not vague; it makes very direct and specific accusations against named individuals and government bodies.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation: The text quotes Peter Golds, "the leader of the Conservatives group in the council," to lend authoritative weight to the condemnation of the council's motion as a "farce."

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation: The text presents a false dichotomy where the UK government's policy is a choice between banning "truth-tellers" like the author and admitting violent "jihad preachers," ignoring all other possibilities and nuances.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – Explanation: The text does not rely on stock phrases that shut down debate; instead, it builds a detailed, albeit biased, argument.

16. Red herring – Yes – Explanation: The main topic is a council's vote to ban Trump, but the author immediately introduces the irrelevant issue of their own ban from the UK to distract from the specifics of the Trump situation and refocus the article on their own grievances.

17. Straw men – No – Explanation: The text does not misrepresent and then refute a specific argument made by the council. Instead, it largely ignores the council's stated reasons and attacks its character and alleged hypocrisy.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – Explanation: The text's core structure is a whataboutism argument. In response to the council banning Trump, the author's immediate retort is, "But... what about" the jihad preachers the UK admits and "what about" the author being banned?

***

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast array of propaganda techniques not to inform, but to persuade the reader toward a specific, highly biased viewpoint. The article's entire framework is built upon the **Whataboutism** fallacy, deflecting from the stated topic (a council's symbolic ban on Trump) to air the author's own grievances. This is supported by a constant stream of **Loaded Language** ("jihad preachers," "appeasement-minded") and **Name-Calling** ("ridiculous exercise in virtue-signaling") designed to create an emotional, negative response toward the author's opponents.

The author constructs a **Black & White Fallacy**, presenting a world where the UK only has two choices: admit "truth tellers" (like the author) or violent extremists. To heighten this effect, the article uses a strong **Appeal to Fear** by including graphic quotes of violence. The credibility of the opposition is attacked through **Doubt** (mentioning corruption scandals) and a direct **Reduction ad Hitlerum**. The argument is not balanced or nuanced; it is a one-sided polemic that uses these techniques to manipulate the reader's perception and demonize the opposing side, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
