Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, obfuscation, appeal to authority, and red herring. These techniques suggest a significant likelihood that the text is intended to influence the reader's perception of the Kavanaugh confirmation process in a biased manner. However, not all possible techniques are present, and the text does provide some factual information, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood of it being pure propaganda.
