Below is the analysis of the text "San Francisco Show Trial Sequel" for each propaganda technique, followed by a final verdict:

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "show trial" (used repeatedly to discredit the legal proceedings), "career criminal" (to describe Zarate), "false-documented illegals" (to delegitimize jurors).  
2. **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: No single phrase or idea is repeated excessively to entrench a message.  
3. **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: "SMASH THE STATE" (graffiti commissioned by Gonzalez, used to frame him as radical).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: "some people are going to have to die" (implies progressive policies lead to innocent deaths like Steinle’s).  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: "observers have grounds to believe that Garcia and Gonzalez both got the jury they wanted" (questions trial fairness).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Minimizes Zarate’s guilt ("confessed shooter guilty only of felony gun possession") while exaggerating the defense’s narrative ("utterly unbelievable claims").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: References to "sanctuary city/state" and immigration policies frame the case as a betrayal of national interests.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: "travesty of justice," "radicals," "Stalinists," "politically correct jury" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Explanation: Compares the trial to "Stalin’s trials" and Castro’s regime, linking opponents to totalitarianism.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: No appeal to popularity or trends.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Blames sanctuary policies alone for Steinle’s death ("found special protection in the sanctuary city").  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: Arguments are presented directly, without deliberate confusion.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Quotes Arthur Koestler, Orwell, and Brecht to validate the narrative.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Portrays the left as inherently pro-criminal ("criminals are victims of capitalist society") and the trial as a binary battle of justice vs. corruption.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: "politically correct jury" (shuts down critique of the verdict).  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: Gonzalez’s Columbia scholarship, graffiti, and communist-linked awards distract from the trial’s details.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: Reduces the defense’s argument to "the shooting was all a matter of chance" to dismiss it.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: No direct accusations of hypocrisy against opponents.  

### Final Verdict:
**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs **11 of 18** analyzed techniques to advance a polarized narrative. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional manipulation** (e.g., loaded language like "travesty of justice," appeals to fear about "innocent victims").  
- **Character assassination** (e.g., name-calling against Gonzalez, Zarate, and the jury).  
- **False dichotomies** (e.g., framing the case as a battle between "social justice paradise" and patriotic values).  
- **Distortion of facts** (e.g., causal oversimplification blaming sanctuary policies, reduction ad Hitlerum invoking Stalin).  
- **Ideological framing** (e.g., quoting left-critic authors like Koestler/Orwell to universalize the argument).  
While based on real events (the Steinle case), the text selectively presents information to vilify opponents, dismiss institutional legitimacy, and provoke outrage. Its tone is accusatory and devoid of balanced analysis, hallmarks of propagandistic intent.
