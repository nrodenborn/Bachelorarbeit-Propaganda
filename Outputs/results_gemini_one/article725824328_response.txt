Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Tony Rezko, an associate of Obama, as a "Syrian Christian crook."

Repetition – No – The text builds a narrative around a central theme but does not repeat a specific message or phrase over and over again.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as slogans.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text attempts to instill fear by referencing the Nation of Islam's potential for violence, stating, "Malcolm X wasn’t adequately afraid of them. Here’s what happened to him:" followed by a link, and by suggesting the photographer feared a "Watergate crap" style break-in.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to cast doubt on Barack Obama's public persona and political affiliations by revealing a suppressed photograph and questioning why the media did not cover his alleged ties to controversial figures.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the potential implications of Obama's supposed sympathies by linking them to a massive "death toll from murder" and comparing it to the "U.S. combat death toll from the equally stupid Iraq War."

Flag-Waving – No – The text discusses American politics but does not use patriotic appeals or symbols to make its case.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language, such as "Syrian Christian crook," "shaking down white institutions," and "wave of black rage."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular; in fact, it suggests it is revealing an unpopular, hidden truth.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple and direct cause for a complex issue by suggesting Obama's potential siding with Black Lives Matter "drove up the death toll from murder by 20%."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The final paragraph uses intentionally vague and speculative phrasing ("you might almost get the impression that...", "I dunno") to suggest a connection between Obama and negative outcomes without making a direct, falsifiable claim.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The article's entire premise is built upon the testimony of the photographer, Askia Muhammad, who is presented as the authority on the photograph, its context, and its potential political impact.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present an argument that forces the reader into one of two choices.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion.

Red herring – Yes – The article introduces the topic of rising murder rates in Obama's last years in office, a subject separate from the 2005 photograph, to distract from the main point and launch a broader attack on his presidency.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent an opponent's argument in order to refute it.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. While it is structured around a factual event (the publication of a photograph), its purpose is not to inform but to persuade the audience to adopt a negative view of Barack Obama. It achieves this by employing a high number of propaganda techniques. The piece uses the photo as a jumping-off point to create a web of negative associations through insinuation, loaded language ("crook," "black rage"), and appeals to fear (invoking Malcolm X's murder). Most significantly, it uses causal oversimplification and a red herring in its conclusion to baselessly link Obama to a rise in the national murder rate, a classic propaganda tactic that connects a target to a broad societal fear without providing concrete evidence. The language is intentionally vague and speculative ("you might almost get the impression") to plant ideas in the reader's mind without making direct, provable accusations. The overall goal is to construct a damaging narrative through suggestion and emotional manipulation rather than objective reporting.
