Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents with insulting terms, such as calling Congressman Adam Schiff and Mike Pompeo “Russia-gate freaks”.
Repetition – Yes – The idea of a “silence” surrounding the Assange case is repeated multiple times, starting with the title “The Eerie Silence” and continuing with phrases like “There is a silence among many who call themselves left,” “eerie silence,” and “there is this silence about Julian.”
Slogans – Yes – The text uses the brief, memorable phrase “demand justice and free speech for Julian” as a rallying cry.
Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests a fearsome outcome if Assange is not supported, stating he could end up “in a hell hole” if extradited to the United States.
Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the credibility of the Russia-gate investigation, stating of The New York Times and The Washington Post, “Their investigations turned up not a shred of real evidence to suggest any serious Russian intervention in the 2016 election.”
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the impact of Assange’s work by claiming he “has exposed a system that threatens humanity.” It also minimizes the Russia investigation by calling it “fakery” and claiming there is “not a shred of real evidence.”
Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to American constitutional principles, stating, “If the Constitution were taken literally, Julian would be a constitutional hero, actually.”
Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as “bogus smear,” “rapacious power,” “profound tragedy,” “vindictive delight,” and “unsavory and immoral.”
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or group to the Nazis or other similarly hated groups.
Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea. In fact, it does the opposite by lamenting the lack of popular support for Assange: “The streets outside the embassy are virtually empty, whereas they should be full of people saying that we are with you.”
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text provides a simple cause for a complex issue, suggesting that journalists oppose Assange simply because “they are shamed. They realize that WikiLeaks has done what they should have done a long time ago”.
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is generally direct in its claims and accusations and does not rely on intentionally unclear or obscure expressions.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites several authorities to support its claims, such as “Rafael Correa, the former president of Ecuador, said recently that he regarded what they are doing to Julian now as torture” and “The United Nations Working Party on Unlawful Detentions has made that clear.”
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by stating, “Only the silence of good people will allow them to win,” implying that one is either a “good person” who speaks out or is complicit in Assange’s persecution.
Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that discourage further thought or discussion, such as “The principles involved in this case are absolutely clear-cut,” which dismisses any potential nuance or complexity.
Red herring – Yes – Towards the end of the interview, the discussion is diverted from Julian Assange to the topic of U.S. collusion with Israel, which serves as a distraction from the central subject.
Straw men – Yes – The text refutes a simplified version of an opposing argument by stating, “That WikiLeaks is somehow in bed with the Russians is ludicrous.” This misrepresents the more complex allegations about Russian intelligence using WikiLeaks as a vehicle for its releases, making the allegation easier to dismiss.
Whataboutism – Yes – The text uses this technique to deflect from the case against Assange by pointing to the perceived hypocrisy of others: “...but what about Judith Miller and The New York Times lying the West into war?”

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a balanced or objective piece of journalism but an interview with a self-described “close friend and supporter of Assange” whose explicit goal is to persuade the audience to adopt a specific viewpoint and take action (“He needs your support and your voice”). The piece systematically employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. It relies heavily on emotional manipulation through loaded language and appeals to fear, while simultaneously building a heroic narrative around Assange (Flag-Waving, Exaggeration). Opponents and differing viewpoints are not engaged with seriously but are dismissed through name-calling, doubt, whataboutism, and straw man arguments. The use of logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy and causal oversimplification serves to frame the issue in stark, simple terms that discourage critical thought, a goal reinforced by thought-terminating clichés. The sheer density and variety of these techniques indicate that the text's primary purpose is persuasion and mobilization, not neutral information, making it a clear example of propaganda.
