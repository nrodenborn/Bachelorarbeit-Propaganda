Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah" (Using multiple names, including Hussein, potentially to evoke foreignness or suspicion), "corrupt Democrat Politician", "corrupt foundation", "known criminal Hillary Clinton".
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – While phrases like "two-tier justice system" are used, they are presented as descriptive claims within arguments, not standalone, brief, memorable slogans designed for mass repetition.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "resulting in a national security breach and at least one death" (linking Clinton's emails to a death to instill fear about her actions and the consequences of not prosecuting her).
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "why does the known criminal Hillary Clinton remain at large...", "we were promised a special counsel to dig into the Clintons and bring about justice" (Questions the legitimacy of Clinton's freedom and the lack of investigation/prosecution).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "trashing our Republic", "billions", "resulting in... at least one death". Minimization: "Saucier who simply took some pictures of his submarine", "a foolish mistake by a very young man".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "the American people weren't promised pardons, we were promised...", "our country", "our Republic" (Appeals to national identity and patriotism).
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "gave Hillary Clinton a pass", "illegal email server", "national security breach", "death", "walking free", "ruined for political reasons", "corrupt foundation", "trashing our Republic", "known criminal", "bring about justice" (Uses emotionally charged words and negative connotations).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt to link ideas/people to Hitler or Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "I continue to ask what a lot of Americans continue to ask" (Appeals to the idea that many Americans share this view/concern).
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – "They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton" (Attributes Saucier's prosecution solely to political backlash over Clinton, ignoring other potential factors like evidence destruction, military protocols, prosecutorial discretion differences).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is generally direct and opinionated, not deliberately vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – "President Trump had spoken of his support of Saucier on the campaign trail" (Uses Trump's support as validating Saucier's position).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The core argument presents only two options: Saucier was prosecuted harshly *because* Clinton was not prosecuted, implying the justice system is purely "two-tier" based on political favoritism in these cases, ignoring nuances, differences in cases (intent, scale, handling of evidence), and other potential reasons for prosecutorial decisions.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – While phrases like "two-tier justice system" and "known criminal" are used, they are part of arguments rather than phrases explicitly used to shut down discussion. The text invites outrage rather than terminating thought.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introducing the poll about "the most corrupt Democrat Politician" and the lengthy discussion about Hillary Clinton's emails, foundation, and Bill Clinton distracts from the specific details and merits of Saucier's lawsuit and his own actions.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text criticizes actual positions (the decision not to prosecute Clinton, the decision to prosecute Saucier) rather than refuting a misrepresented argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – The *entire* defense of Saucier and the main argument of the text relies on "What about Hillary Clinton?" ("The same FBI that gave Hillary Clinton a pass... but would not give the same leniency to Saucier", "but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton. Hillary is still walking free", "But hey, Hillary is free, right?"). Saucier's actions are defended by charging the authorities with hypocrisy in not prosecuting Clinton more severely.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of identifiable propaganda techniques. Its primary purpose is not to neutrally report on Saucier's lawsuit but to advance a highly partisan narrative attacking Hillary Clinton, the Obama administration, and Democrats ("corrupt Democrat Politician" poll) while defending Saucier and aligning with Trump. This is achieved through:
*   **Loaded Language & Name-Calling:** Pervasive use of emotionally charged, negative terms for opponents ("corrupt," "illegal," "known criminal," "trashing our Republic") and minimizing language for the favored subject ("simply took some pictures," "foolish mistake").
*   **Whataboutism & False Comparison:** The core argument hinges entirely on deflecting from Saucier's admitted crime by accusing authorities of hypocrisy regarding Clinton, despite significant differences in the cases (scale, intent, evidence handling, prosecutorial discretion).
*   **Appeal to Fear & Emotion:** Linking Clinton's actions to a "national security breach and at least one death."
*   **Bandwagon & Flag-Waving:** Framing the criticism of Clinton as the concern of "a lot of Americans" and "the American people."
*   **Repetition:** Emphasizing the "corrupt Democrat" poll question.
*   **Causal Oversimplification & Black/White Fallacy:** Reducing complex prosecutorial decisions to pure political favoritism ("two-tier justice system") and attributing Saucier's prosecution solely to Clinton-related backlash.
*   **Red Herring:** The poll and extensive focus on Clinton's unrelated actions distract from the lawsuit's specifics.
*   **Exaggeration/Minimization:** Downplaying Saucier's offense while dramatically exaggerating Clinton's impact.
The text consistently selects facts (ignoring the destruction of evidence in Saucier's case, downplaying the differences between the cases) and employs rhetorical techniques designed to provoke outrage against political opponents and validate a specific political viewpoint, making it overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda.
