1. Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack a person, group, or idea. Terms like "black death" or "medieval disease" are descriptive and historical, used to add gravity rather than as direct insults against a subject.
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that antibiotic resistance is "inevitable" and that the healthcare system will be "overwhelmed" or "unable to cope" is stated multiple times. For example, "antibiotics resistance is inevitable" and "antibiotic resistance is more or less inevitable," as well as "Madagascar healthcare system will be overwhelmed" and "experts continue to fear the healthcare system is on the brink of being overwhelmed."
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases that function as a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text is built around creating fear and anxiety. Phrases like "making this disease much more terrifying," "the disease will have control of the nation," "deadly plague outbreak," and "the plague will be far, far scarier" are used to support the idea that the situation is critical and frightening.
5. Doubt – No – The text does not attempt to question the credibility of any source. It does the opposite by citing experts to build its own credibility.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses speculative and hyperbolic statements to exaggerate the potential outcome. For example, "the disease will have control of the nation" and "it will be all but impossible to control" are exaggerations of a possible future, presented as a near certainty.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the audience. Phrases like "black death," "medieval disease," and "terrifying" are chosen to evoke fear and a sense of a primitive, uncontrolled danger rather than using neutral, clinical terms.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparison to a group hated by the audience to discredit an idea.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular. It appeals to authority, not popularity.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simplified cause-and-effect relationship for a complex issue. The statement, "If you throw more and more antibiotics at patients, antibiotic resistance is more or less inevitable," simplifies the multiple factors involved in the development of antibiotic resistance into a single, direct, and unavoidable outcome.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague; its message of impending danger is very clear and direct.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on the statements of experts and officials to lend weight to its claims. It explicitly cites "Officials," "experts," "a scientist," "Professor John Joe McFadden," and "Dr. Derek Gatherer."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy where the only two options are the current state (where antibiotics work) and a future catastrophic state where resistance is inevitable and the disease is uncontrollable. It ignores other possibilities, such as successful containment, the development of new treatments, or a slower, more manageable development of resistance.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – All the information presented in the text is relevant to the central topic of the plague outbreak and its potential dangers.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or attack a counter-argument; it focuses on building its own narrative.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect blame or criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 80% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda, or at least sensationalist journalism that uses propagandistic techniques. While it is based on a real-world event and cites what appear to be credible authorities, its primary goal is not to inform objectively but to persuade the reader of a specific, terrifying narrative. The article overwhelmingly employs techniques designed to manipulate emotion and perception. The heavy reliance on Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language ("black death," "terrifying"), and Exaggeration ("disease will have control of the nation") creates a sense of panic. This is reinforced by Repetition of the key warning points. Furthermore, it uses logical fallacies like the Black & White Fallacy to present a simplistic and catastrophic future, and Causal Oversimplification to make drug resistance seem like a simple and unavoidable consequence. The use of Appeal to Authority serves to legitimize this fear-based narrative. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to shape the audience's emotional response and perception of risk, which is a core function of propaganda.
