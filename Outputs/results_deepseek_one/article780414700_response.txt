Below is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the provided text, followed by a final verdict:

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text uses negative labels like "homosexual subculture," "deviant sexual acts," "degenerate and even criminal shepherds," and "sexual predators." These terms attack groups/individuals within the Church.  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The word "tired" is repeated four times ("I am tired of this... tired of people being hurt... tired of the obfuscation... tired of sin"). "Sin" is also repeated relentlessly (e.g., "We must be done with sin," "rooted out," "no refuge for sin").  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL"). The closing quote ("As for me and my household...") is biblical but not original or crafted for mass appeal.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Warns of "grave, lasting consequences," "suspicion and mistrust," and the "wages of sin" to instill fear about inaction. Example: "The result... harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake."  
5. **Doubt** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not question credibility ambiguously. It makes direct accusations (e.g., against "complicit" leaders) without rhetorical doubt.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – Explanation: Descriptions of abuse ("gruesome detail," "sickening") align with verified scandals. No clear minimization (e.g., of victims) or hyperbolic exaggeration beyond the crisis’s gravity.  
7. **Flag-waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to Catholic identity and duty: "defense of the Church’s moral teaching," "sacred duty before God," and "vineyard of the Lord." Example: "We must cast out sin... and run toward holiness."  
8. **Loaded language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Emotionally charged terms like "depravity," "sickening," "evil," "wickedness," "predation," and "scandalous" pervade the text to evoke outrage.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis, fascism, or universally hated groups. References to "Vichy" or similar are absent.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Explanation: Urges alignment with "many faithful Catholics" and "holy and faithful lay people" demanding reform. Example: "I stand with them... I ask you all to join me."  
11. **Causal oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: Acknowledges multifaceted causes (e.g., cover-ups, acceptance of sin, abuse of power), not just one factor. Explicitly states: "the problems are both and they are more."  
12. **Obfuscation** – **No** – Explanation: The text is direct and specific (e.g., naming McCarrick, detailing reforms). No deliberate vagueness.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Cites St. Thomas Aquinas ("hatred of wickedness... belongs to charity"), Scripture (Proverbs 8:7), and the Bishop’s own position to validate arguments.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents false binaries, e.g., bishops must either "follow suit or face the charge of being complicit." Also, "true love can never exist without truth" implies no middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: No phrases like "it is what it is" or "just the way things are." The text invites action and dialogue (e.g., "report it," "pray," "fast").  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: Focuses exclusively on clergy abuse and reforms without diverting to irrelevant topics.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: Does not misrepresent opposing views. Critiques real positions (e.g., separating homosexuality from pedophilia) without distortion.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy toward critics (e.g., "What about your sins?"). Focuses on internal Church accountability.

### Verdict – 75% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** (75%) due to its systematic use of persuasive techniques to advance a specific agenda: condemning homosexuality within the clergy and mobilizing reform. Key indicators:  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language (e.g., "evil," "depravity") and appeals to fear (e.g., "harm to the Church’s future") dominate the text, aiming to provoke outrage rather than encourage nuanced discussion.  
- **Us-vs.-Them Framing**: Name-calling ("homosexual subculture," "degenerate shepherds") and black-and-white fallacies (e.g., complicity vs. righteousness) polarize readers, painting dissent as morally bankrupt.  
- **Authority & Identity Appeals**: Quotes from Aquinas and Scripture, combined with flag-waving to Catholic identity, lend unquestionable legitimacy to the Bishop’s stance. Repetition of "sin" and "tired" reinforces moral urgency.  
- **Bandwagon Pressure**: Calls to "join me" and references to "many faithful" create social pressure to conform.  
- **Agenda-Driven Focus**: While addressing real issues (clergy abuse), it disproportionately targets homosexuality as a root cause, ignoring broader systemic factors (e.g., clericalism, power imbalances). This selective emphasis aligns with ideological goals, not neutral analysis.  

However, it avoids some techniques (e.g., obfuscation, straw men) and includes practical steps (reporting mechanisms, fasting), slightly mitigating its propagandistic nature. Ultimately, its primary function is to persuade, not inform, making it **predominantly propaganda**.
