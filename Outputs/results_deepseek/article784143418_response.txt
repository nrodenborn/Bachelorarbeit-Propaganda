Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "enemedia" is an insulting label used to attack the media.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No distinct, memorable phrase is used as a slogan throughout the main narrative.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Descriptions like "jihad training camp," "Raising an army for jihad slaughter," and "killing non-believers" instill fear about the group's activities and intentions.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Calling mainstream media "enemedia" and stating it is "scrubbing and censoring this story" directly questions the credibility and honesty of news organizations.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – Explanation: While the language is charged ("slaughter"), the core claims (training for jihad, weapons cache, child's death) are presented as facts from the affidavit. No clear minimization of opposing views beyond dismissal.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: No explicit appeal to patriotism, national identity, or loyalty is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Words like "jihad slaughter," "squalid," "enemedia," and "just as we have warned/predicted" use emotionally charged and prejudicial language to evoke strong negative reactions.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparison or association with Hitler or universally hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: No appeal is made to the popularity of the viewpoint or idea being presented.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text presents the group's alleged actions as the problem, without oversimplifying a complex societal issue down to a single cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is direct and specific in its accusations, quoting the affidavit. While inflammatory, it's not deliberately obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Relies heavily on quoting the FBI affidavit and FBI agents to validate the claims about jihad training and the boy's statements.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: The text presents the group's actions as criminal and rejects their defense, but doesn't explicitly frame the entire situation as having only two possible choices or outcomes for the reader.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Phrases like "There it is" and "just as we have warned/predicted for years" serve to shut down critical examination by presenting the situation as self-evidently confirming a pre-existing narrative.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: The poll about replacing Nikki Haley as UN Ambassador is completely irrelevant to the story about the New Mexico compound and serves as a distraction.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text accurately summarizes the defense's argument ("freedom of religion," "discriminated against") before dismissing it. It doesn't misrepresent their argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not accuse its opponents (the defense, the media) of hypocrisy by pointing to their own misdeeds or inconsistencies.

**Verdict – 70%** – Explanation: The text exhibits several clear propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Loaded Language, Appeal to Authority, Thought-terminating Clichés, Red Herring). While it reports factual elements from an FBI affidavit (training, weapons, child's death), the presentation is heavily slanted through inflammatory language ("jihad slaughter," "enemedia"), the insertion of irrelevant content (the poll), and framing designed to confirm a specific narrative and shut down dissent ("just as we warned," "There it is"). The core news is real, but its packaging and the commentary surrounding it strongly push a specific, fear-based interpretation while attacking critics and the media, meeting the threshold for propaganda.
