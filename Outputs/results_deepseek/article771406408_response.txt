Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "Muslim killer" (used repeatedly), labeling the judicial process a "tragic comedy of denial" and a "tired farce".
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The phrase "Muslim killer" is used multiple times. "Allahu Akbar" is repeated and highlighted as significant. The idea that authorities are giving the killer a pass ("the killer gets a pass", "letting him get away with it") is repeated.
3.  **Slogans – Yes** – The headline itself: "France Gives Muslim Killer of Elderly Jewish Woman a Pass". Also, "Allahu Akbar usually means motive unknown".
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – The text strongly implies that authorities systematically protect Muslim attackers due to denial or bias, creating fear about the justice system and societal safety ("This just continues the pattern", "the authorities allowed him to commit the crime", "the system that keeps on protecting him").
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – The text repeatedly questions the credibility of the authorities and the judicial process ("the authorities stonewalled at every turn", "predictably, the killer gets a pass", "In the tragic comedy of denial", "for some unclear reason", "Yet the police still failed").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – **Exaggeration:** "the authorities allowed him to commit the crime" implies deliberate facilitation. "Blood everywhere" intensifies the scene. **Minimization:** Dismissing the psychiatric evaluation as a "tired farce" and implying the lack of prior history definitively means no mental health issue ("despite having no history of mental illness", "Sure he was crazy. So crazy he tried to contrive an alibi" - sarcastically dismissing the claim).
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Appeals to French identity/civic duty by accusing French authorities ("France Gives... a Pass", "the authorities", "the system") of failing in their duty to protect citizens and deliver justice.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Numerous emotionally charged words/phrases: "violently beaten", "dragged", "tragic comedy of denial", "stonewalled", "predictably", "mercilessly", "vilified", "dirty Jews", "Satan", "blood everywhere", "contrive an alibi", "system that keeps on protecting him".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes** – Strongly links the killer and his family to anti-Semitism ("known for its anti-Semitism", "pushed my sister down the stairs... called her a dirty Jew", "killer called Sarah and her daughter, 'dirty Jews'"), invoking a group historically hated by the likely target audience.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – While it mentions a "pattern", it doesn't explicitly appeal to the *popularity* of the idea that authorities give passes. The focus is on the author's claim of a pattern, not its widespread acceptance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Attributes the failure to prosecute and the crime itself primarily to the killer's Muslim identity and religious motivations ("Muslim killer", "Allahu Akbar"), downplaying other potential complex factors like the specific psychiatric findings, legal procedures, or the details of the police response.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is quite direct and specific in its accusations and descriptions. It doesn't rely on deliberately unclear language.
13. **Appeal to authority – Weak/Yes (Borderline)** – Cites statements from the victim's son and brother ("Yonathan Halimi... describes", "Sarah’s brother said") as evidence of the family's anti-Semitism, using their status as victims/family for credibility. Not a traditional authority figure, but used to bolster the claim.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents the situation as authorities either prosecuting the killer properly or giving him a pass/protecting him ("the authorities stonewalled... predictably, the killer gets a pass", "The authorities allowed him to commit the crime. Now they're letting him get away with it"). Ignores nuances of legal process, psychiatric evaluation, or police decision-making.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "Allahu Akbar usually means motive unknown." This phrase dismisses any need to explore potential complex motives by reducing the religious utterance to a cliché implying automatic denial by authorities.
16. **Red herring – Yes** – The detailed account of the police response and failure to storm the apartment immediately, while part of the narrative, distracts from the core legal argument about the trial fitness ruling. It serves to build outrage against the authorities more broadly.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – The text sarcastically dismisses the psychiatric finding ("Sure he was crazy. So crazy he tried to contrive an alibi") by implying that attempting to create an alibi is *proof* he couldn't be mentally ill. This misrepresents the psychiatric argument, which wouldn't claim such an action is impossible for someone deemed unfit for trial due to a psychotic episode.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The text does not charge its opponents (authorities, the system) with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions or statements. It accuses them of failure and bias, but not hypocrisy in this specific sense.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a significant number of propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Reduction ad Hitlerum, Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-Terminating Cliché, Red Herring, Straw Men) to present a highly biased and emotionally charged narrative. The core message frames a tragic event through a lens of systemic bias protecting Muslim perpetrators at the expense of Jewish victims, using selective facts, inflammatory language, and logical fallacies to evoke outrage and promote a specific ideological viewpoint about Islam, immigration, and the French justice system. While based on real events, the presentation is manipulative and designed to persuade rather than objectively inform.
