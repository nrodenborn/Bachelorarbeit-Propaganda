1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses numerous insulting labels to attack its subjects, such as calling the US “Big Brother USA,” South Korea a “junior sidekick” and a “reluctant South Korean satrap,” US officials “neocon minions” and “bootlickers,” and Nikki Haley a “loud-mouthed neocon.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that “neocons” are deliberately sabotaging the peace process is repeated throughout the text. It is introduced in the first paragraph (“wicked plan by Washington neocons to sabotage Korean peace talks”), mentioned again in the middle (“North Korea was right on target when it accused arch-neocon John Bolton of trying to sabotage the peace deal”), and speculated on near the end (“Some wondered if Bolton and perhaps Pompeo were trying to sabotage the North Korea deal”).

3. Slogans – Yes – The author creates a brief, memorable, and cynical phrase to describe the US policy towards Iran: “‘eat sand and die.’”

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear of a potential war by highlighting US military actions, such as staging “major air force exercises on North Korea’s border,” flying “B-52 heavy bombers and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters,” and having “missile-armed subs lurked at sea.” This is reinforced by mentioning maneuvers that “raise the threat of war.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The text consistently questions the credibility and sincerity of the US government, for example by stating, “As Trump administration mouthpieces were gabbing about peace and light, the US Air Force was getting ready to fly B-52 heavy bombers…” and by highlighting “Trump’s deceit in dealing with Iran.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration for effect, for instance by describing the US action as potentially “one of the stupidest acts that I can recall.” It also minimizes North Korea's own provocative history by framing their reactions as entirely justified (“Who can blame the North Koreans for blowing their tops?”).

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text uses a form of reverse flag-waving to appeal to a specific anti-interventionist American identity. It claims that for neocons, “Israel’s interests came before those of the United States,” suggesting the criticized policy is un-American and a betrayal of national interests.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to influence the reader, such as “wicked plan,” “prickly North Koreans,” “furious,” “gabbing,” “neocon minions,” “fanatically pro-Israel,” and “hapless Libyan leader.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses the same structure by disapproving of US policy by consistently associating it with “neocons,” a group portrayed as a monolithic and malicious entity hated by the intended audience. For example: “Because Bolton, as an arch neocon, was fanatically pro-Israel…”

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The author attempts to create a sense of consensus behind their viewpoint by stating, “Veteran Korea observers, this writer included, find it hard to believe Kim Jong-un will give up his nuclear weapons,” implying that all knowledgeable people share this skepticism.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex situation of the Korean peace talks to a single, simple cause: a “wicked plan by Washington neocons to sabotage” them, largely ignoring other geopolitical factors or North Korea's own strategic motivations.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague. Its author is direct and forceful in making accusations and stating opinions, even if they are speculative. The goal is to present a clear, albeit biased, narrative, not to confuse the audience with obscurity.

13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does not use an authority's support as evidence for its claims. Instead, it criticizes figures of authority like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo. The author's self-reference as a "veteran Korea observer" is a minor appeal to their own authority, but it is not the primary technique used to support the argument.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The very first sentence presents a false dichotomy: the US action must be “either one of the stupidest acts that I can recall or a very wicked plan.” This ignores a range of other possibilities, such as it being a standard, pre-planned military exercise with unfortunate timing.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that discourage critical thought by presenting a conclusion as obvious. For example, the rhetorical question, “Who can blame the North Koreans for blowing their tops?” is designed to shut down any analysis of North Korea's reaction and present it as the only possible response.

16. Red herring – No – The references to the Iran deal and Libya are not irrelevant distractions. They are used as central evidence to support the main argument that the US is untrustworthy and that North Korea is right to be suspicious.

17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent a specific counter-argument and then refute that distorted version. It primarily engages in direct attacks and assertions against its targets (the US government, neocons).

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The final section of the text deflects from the issue of North Korean denuclearization by charging the US with hypocrisy. It asks, “why does North Korea not demand that the US get rid of its nuclear weapons based in South Korea, Okinawa, Guam and with the 7th Fleet?” This is a classic whataboutism tactic.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It is not a balanced or objective analysis but a highly persuasive opinion piece that employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to promote a specific, one-sided narrative.

The author systematically uses techniques like Name Calling (“Big Brother USA,” “neocon minions”), Loaded Language (“wicked,” “sabotage,” “deceit”), and Causal Oversimplification to construct a simple story with clear villains (US neocons) and justified victims (North Korea). The argument is framed using a Black & White Fallacy from the very first sentence. It heavily relies on casting Doubt on the intentions of the US while using Thought-Terminating Clichés (“Who can blame the North Koreans…”) to guide the reader to a predetermined conclusion. Finally, it employs Whataboutism to deflect criticism from North Korea and redirect it towards the US. The sheer number and deliberate application of these techniques indicate the author's primary goal is not to inform, but to manipulate the reader's perception and rally them to a particular point of view.
