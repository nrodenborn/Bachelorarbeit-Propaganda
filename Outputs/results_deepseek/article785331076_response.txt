Here is the analysis of the propaganda techniques present in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No direct insulting label is applied to the officer or police beyond loaded terms like "blue privilege" which is more loaded language.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively in the poll section.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrase is used as a slogan for a broader cause or idea within the main article text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The headline and narrative ("Super scary", "pretty scary") highlight the fear of police mistakenly killing innocent people in their own homes, implying this could happen to anyone. The comparison to civilians going to jail also instills fear of unequal justice.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the lack of arrest ("she has not yet been arrested", "has yet to be arrested"), casting doubt on the credibility and fairness of the police department and justice system ("blue privilege").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The headline "Cop Walks Into Home She Thought Was Hers, Kills Innocent Homeowner—Not Arrested" uses stark, dramatic language. Phrases like "sheer insane state", "glaring function of blue privilege", and "slap to the face" are emotionally charged exaggerations. The officer's actions are minimized by the lack of arrest.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Numerous emotionally charged words and phrases are used: "sheer insane state", "tragic story", "glaring function of blue privilege", "slap to the face", "grieving for the rest of their lives", "Super scary", "pretty scary". "Blue privilege" itself is a loaded term implying systemic favoritism.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Hitler, Nazis, or universally hated groups is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal is made to the popularity of the idea or action being promoted.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text strongly implies that the *only* reason the officer wasn't arrested immediately is "blue privilege", simplifying a complex legal and procedural situation (ongoing investigation, administrative leave protocols) down to a single cause of systemic bias.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – While some details are initially unclear (how exactly the shooting happened), the text reports the known facts (officer's statement, location, victim info, current status) and attributes the lack of clarity to the ongoing investigation. It doesn't deliberately obscure facts relevant to its main argument about the arrest.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authority figure or institution is cited to support the article's main argument or perspective. It actually undermines the authority of the police.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text explicitly presents only two options: "If an average citizen... they would be in jail—right now. However, instead... she was simply placed on administrative leave." This frames the situation as *either* immediate jail (for civilians) *or* administrative leave (for police), ignoring potential middle steps or nuances in either scenario.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" or "common sense" are used to shut down discussion. The text invites discussion and outrage.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The entire poll section ("Who should replace Nikki Haley...") and its associated text ("take our poll", "Completing this poll grants you access...", "Privacy Policy") is completely irrelevant to the tragic shooting story and serves to distract the reader, likely to capture emails or engagement.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text doesn't misrepresent or refute an argument not actually made by opponents. It focuses on the facts of the event and the lack of arrest, contrasting it with a hypothetical civilian scenario.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing others (e.g., critics of the police) of hypocrisy. The hypothetical civilian scenario ("If an average citizen...") is used for contrast, not to charge an opponent with hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 60% –** The text is primarily a factual news report about a tragic incident, detailing the event, police statements, witness reaction, and family impact. However, it exhibits significant elements of propaganda. The headline and body use **Loaded Language** ("sheer insane state", "blue privilege", "slap to the face") and **Exaggeration** to heighten emotional impact and outrage. It employs **Appeal to Fear** by emphasizing the randomness and vulnerability of the victim. It casts **Doubt** on police motives and fairness. It uses **Causal Oversimplification** ("blue privilege") and the **Black & White Fallacy** (civilian=jail instantly vs cop=no consequences) to frame the narrative simplistically. Crucially, it includes a **Red Herring** (the Nikki Haley poll) which is pure distraction unrelated to the story. While based on a real event, the selective framing, emotionally manipulative language, logical fallacies, and irrelevant diversion push it towards propaganda, aiming to shape a specific, critical view of police accountability. The presence of factual reporting prevents it from being rated higher.
