Based on the provided definitions and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – The text does not attack any subject with insulting labels. It reports facts neutrally (e.g., "deadly virus", "hemorrhagic fever" are clinical terms).
2.  **Repetition** – No – No specific message or phrase is repeated excessively for persuasive effect. The information is presented sequentially.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used for persuasion (e.g., no rallying cries or campaign-like slogans).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the text discusses a serious disease (Ebola), it reports facts about its fatality and spread without using language designed to instill fear to promote a specific action or viewpoint. The tone is informative, not alarmist.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person, organization, or idea. It reports statements from authorities (WHO, Congo government) as facts.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text reports figures ("21 cases", "17 deaths", "90 percent") and historical context ("ninth outbreak") factually without apparent overstatement or understatement.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity to garner support for an idea or action.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is primarily neutral and factual. Terms like "deadly virus" and "hemorrhagic fever" are standard descriptive terms for Ebola, not emotionally charged stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – The text does not attempt to disapprove of any idea by associating it with a hated group.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or action to encourage acceptance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text acknowledges the complexity ("investigate how the outbreak first started", mentions animal origins) and does not attribute the outbreak to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific about locations (Bikoro, Equateur province), numbers, organizations involved (WHO, Doctors Without Borders), timelines, and actions being taken. There is no deliberate vagueness.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text cites statements and actions from authorities (Congo's Health Ministry, WHO, Dr. Peter Salama) as evidence supporting the facts of the outbreak and the response. (Example: "Congo's Health Ministry said...", "WHO said Tuesday that it is working closely...", "Dr. Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general... said").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents a factual situation (an outbreak is occurring, a response is underway) without framing choices or options in an oversimplified "either/or" manner.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – There are no phrases used to shut down critical thinking or discussion (e.g., no "common sense", "everyone knows", or unquestionable dogma).
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on reporting the Ebola outbreak, its context, and the response. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not present or refute any arguments that weren't made. It is purely informational reporting.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge any opponent with hypocrisy. It simply reports the current outbreak and distinguishes it from the 2014 West Africa outbreak factually.

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is overwhelmingly a straightforward, factual news report about the declaration of an Ebola outbreak in Congo. It cites official sources (Congo government, WHO), provides specific details (location, cases, deaths, historical context, response actions), and maintains a neutral, informative tone. The single instance of "Appeal to Authority" is a standard journalistic practice of attributing information to credible sources (like health ministries and the WHO) and is used here to establish factual accuracy, not as a persuasive propaganda technique to bypass critical evaluation. There is no discernible intent to manipulate the audience's emotions, beliefs, or actions beyond informing them. The 5% acknowledges the inherent potential for framing in any reporting, but the content itself shows no significant signs of propaganda techniques being employed deceptively.
