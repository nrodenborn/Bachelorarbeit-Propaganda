Verdict – 10% – The text primarily provides information about a scientific observation related to Neptune's storms. It includes some exaggeration when describing the size of the storms, and it uses quotes from scientists, which could be seen as an appeal to authority. However, these elements are minor and do not strongly suggest that the text is propaganda. The primary purpose of the text seems to be informative rather than persuasive or manipulative.
