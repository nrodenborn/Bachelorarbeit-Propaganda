Based on the provided definitions and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Trump calls Hillary Clinton's actions "small potatoes", a dismissive and insulting label minimizing her alleged wrongdoing.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – No specific phrase or message is repeated insistently throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – The text contains quotes and statements, but no brief, memorable phrases designed as slogans (like "Make America Great Again") are used within the quoted material.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – The text does not attempt to instill fear against alternatives to support an idea.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Trump explicitly questions the credibility and fairness of Jeff Sessions ("So unfair Jeff, Double Standard").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Trump minimizes Hillary Clinton's alleged actions by calling them "small potatoes" compared to Winner's leak. He also exaggerates the unfairness of Winner's sentence ("So unfair").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – There is no explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity within the quoted statements or the reporting.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Winner's description of Trump as an "orange fascist" uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language. Trump's "small potatoes" and "Double Standard" are also loaded terms.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No idea is disapproved by linking it to a group hated by the audience (e.g., Nazis).
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal is made to the popularity of an idea to encourage acceptance.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Trump attributes Winner's sentence solely to Sessions' "Double Standard," oversimplifying the complex legal reasons behind the sentencing and ignoring other factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The quoted statements are relatively direct, even if argumentative or dismissive. There's no deliberate use of unclear or obscure language to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – No authority figure's support is cited as evidence for a claim within the quoted statements.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – While Trump contrasts Winner's case with Clinton's, he doesn't explicitly present *only* two options or force a false dilemma. The text reports this contrast but doesn't frame the overall situation in such stark binary terms.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Trump's use of "small potatoes" and "Double Standard" are simplistic phrases potentially used to dismiss the complexity of the Clinton investigation and Winner's sentencing, discouraging deeper analysis.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Trump's introduction of "what Hillary Clinton did" is irrelevant to the specific discussion of Reality Winner's sentence and serves to distract from it.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text does not show anyone refuting an argument that wasn't actually presented by the opponent.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Trump's core argument ("Gee, this is ‘small potatoes’ compared to what Hillary Clinton did!") is classic whataboutism. He charges his opponents (implicitly, those who pursued Winner) with hypocrisy by pointing to the lack of similar punishment for Clinton.

**Verdict – 20% –** While the text *reports* statements by Donald Trump and Reality Winner that contain several propaganda techniques (Name calling, Doubt, Exaggeration/minimization, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, Thought-terminating clichés, Red herring, Whataboutism), the **article itself is primarily a factual news report**. It presents events (Trump's tweet, Winner's sentence, her mother's plea, background on Winner's views) and quotes from involved parties without overtly employing propaganda techniques *in its own narrative voice* to manipulate the reader. The journalist's role here is descriptive rather than persuasive. The presence of propagandistic quotes within a news report does not automatically make the entire report propaganda, as its primary function is informational. However, the inclusion of these quotes means the text *contains* propaganda elements from its sources. The low percentage reflects that the article's core structure is reporting, not active persuasion using these techniques.
