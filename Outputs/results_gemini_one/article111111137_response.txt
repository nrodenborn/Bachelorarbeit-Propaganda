Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack any person or group. It refers to Nikolas Cruz as an "expelled former student," which is a factual description of his status, not an insult.

Repetition – No – The text does not repeat a specific message or phrase to reinforce a point. It is a factual report with varied information.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to rally support for or against an idea.

Appeal to fear – No – While the subject matter (a school shooting) is frightening, the article reports the facts of the event and the legislative response without using fear-mongering language to support a particular idea.

Doubt – No – The text does not attempt to question the credibility of any person or entity. It reports Governor Scott's indecision on the bill, but this is presented as a factual statement of his position, not an attempt to cast doubt on him.

Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text describes the event as "one of the worst school shootings in US history," which is a factual and widely accepted assessment, not a propagandistic exaggeration. The details are presented factually.

Flag-Waving – No – The text mentions the Second Amendment, but only in the context of explaining the position of gun rights advocates. The article itself does not make an appeal to patriotism.

Loaded Language – No – The text is written in a neutral, journalistic tone. While it quotes legislators referring to a "poison pill," this is reporting their language, not using it as the article's own voice. Phrases like "gunning down" are descriptive of the violent act rather than being used primarily to manipulate emotion.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that readers should support the bill because it is popular or because other states have similar laws. It simply states the fact that "Florida now joins at least six other states" as a point of information.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The article does not attempt to explain the cause of the complex issue of school shootings or gun violence with a simple, single reason. It reports on the event and the legislative reaction.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is specific and clear, providing details such as the bill's contents, the vote count (67-50), and the names of individuals and the legislation.

Appeal to authority – No – The article quotes various individuals like a victim's father and the governor, but it does so to present their opinions and positions as part of a balanced news report, not to use their authority as indisputable evidence for a claim.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text avoids this fallacy by presenting a nuanced situation. It details the parts of the bill that passed, the parts that were excluded (like the assault weapons ban), and the controversial inclusion of the "guardian programme," showing the complexity of the compromise.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases or clichés that are designed to discourage critical thought.

Red herring – No – The article sticks to the topic of the Florida shooting and the resulting legislation. The mention of a separate shooting in Alabama serves as relevant context about the ongoing national issue of school gun violence, not as a distraction.

Straw men – No – The article reports on the positions and debates as they happened; it does not create and then refute a false or misrepresented argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to charge any party with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 5% – The text is a piece of standard journalistic reporting, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader about a specific event (the passing of a gun control bill) and its context. The article maintains a neutral tone, presents facts from multiple sources, and includes viewpoints from different sides of the issue (proponents of the bill, legislators who see parts of it as a "poison pill," and the undecided governor). It avoids using the emotional manipulation, logical fallacies, and biased framing that characterize propaganda. The very low percentage accounts for the inherent, unavoidable biases in any form of communication, such as the choice of what facts to include, but the text does not actively employ propaganda techniques.
