**Verdict – 60% –**  
**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, bandwagon, obfuscation/vagueness, appeal to authority, and red herring. These techniques are used to cast suspicion on the official narrative, sensationalize the story, and evoke emotional responses from the audience. However, the text also includes factual reporting and direct quotations from authorities, which tempers its overall propagandistic nature. The presence of multiple propaganda techniques, especially in the social media excerpts and the framing of certain details, suggests a significant likelihood (about 60%) that the text is propaganda, primarily in its effort to stir controversy, suspicion, and emotional reaction rather than to inform objectively.
