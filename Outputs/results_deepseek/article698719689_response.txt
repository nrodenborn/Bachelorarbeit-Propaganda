Here's the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against any person, group, or idea.
2.  **Repetition** – No – Key points (like case numbers, spread, types) are mentioned, but not repeated excessively with the sole intent to hammer a message.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – The text emphasizes the "unprecedented rate" of spread, the "huge concern" it moving to "densely populated regions," the extreme fatality within "12 to 24 hours," historical reference to the deadly "black death," and the difficulty of cure in "underdeveloped regions." This instills fear about the plague's severity and potential global threat.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The credibility of sources (WHO, BNGRC, experts) or information is not questioned.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The numbers (57 dead, 680+ infected, 35 districts) and descriptions (unprecedented rate, more virulent, extremely short incubation) are presented as reported facts by authorities without clear evidence of over/understatement. Calling it the "black death" is a historical reference, not an exaggeration in this context.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no appeal to patriotism, nationalism, or group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – While mostly factual, the use of "black death" carries heavy historical connotations of extreme mortality and terror, evoking a strong emotional response beyond the clinical description. Words like "unprecedented," "huge concern," "more virulent," "extremely short," and "difficult at best" also carry emotional weight.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No idea is linked to a hated group to discredit it.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The popularity of an idea is not used as an argument for its validity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The cause (bacterium, fleas, rats, airborne transmission) is explained without oversimplifying the complex factors behind the outbreak's spread.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The information is presented clearly with specific numbers, sources, and definitions of plague types.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text repeatedly cites the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Bureau for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC), health officials, and experts to establish credibility for the information presented (e.g., "According to CNN, the cases were reported by both the WHO and BNGRC", "experts warn", "health officials report").
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No situation is presented with only two extreme choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used to shut down critical thinking or discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the plague outbreak; no irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented arguments are presented and refuted.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy are made against opponents.

**Verdict – 10% –** The text is overwhelmingly a factual news report based on data from credible health organizations (WHO, BNGRC) and expert commentary. It details the specifics of the outbreak (numbers, locations, types, transmission, symptoms, response efforts) without overtly pushing a specific political agenda or call to action beyond public health awareness. The primary purpose appears to be informational. However, it employs **Appeal to fear** (highlighting rapid spread, lethality, historical parallels) and **Loaded Language** (using terms like "black death") to emphasize the severity and urgency of the situation, which are common in public health warnings but fit the definitions of propaganda techniques. The **Appeal to authority** is appropriate journalistic practice in this context. These techniques are present but used minimally and within the framework of reporting alarming facts, not to manipulate towards a specific ideology unrelated to the health threat. Therefore, while containing elements of propaganda techniques, the core function and content are primarily informational, resulting in a very low likelihood of the text being overall propaganda.
