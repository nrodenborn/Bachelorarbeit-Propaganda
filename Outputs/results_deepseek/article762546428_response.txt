Based on the definitions provided and the text analysis, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "leftist social engineering", "brainwashing", "indoctrination", "collectivist agenda", "authoritarian policies". These are insulting labels applied to public schools, their curriculum, and government.
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – The ideas of "social engineering", "brainwashing", "indoctrination", and the dangers/violence of public schools are repeated multiple times throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans – No** – While phrases like "tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg" are evocative, there isn't a single, brief, memorable phrase used repeatedly as a slogan for the core message.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – The text heavily relies on fear: fear of "liberal violence", fear of school shootings ("Parkland... was the last straw"), fear of "unsafe environments", fear of "bullying", fear of "pressure to get into drugs, pressure to get into sexual activity", and fear of "the absolute horror of what allowing the state to educate our children has done".
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – The text constantly casts doubt on the safety, morality, and academic integrity of public schools and the government running them (e.g., "schools continue to fail", "authoritarian policies... wreak havoc", "brainwashing and indoctrination", implying public schools cannot teach right from wrong logically/critically).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration: "skyrocketing", "social engineering... amounts to brainwashing and indoctrination", "tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg", "absolute horror", "kept most of humanity enslaved for centuries". Minimization: Government is reduced to "nothing more than a handful of people".
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – While appealing to parental identity/instincts, there is no specific appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Pervasive use of emotionally charged words: "seethe", "skyrocketing", "more and more upset", "indoctrination", "so bad", "liberal violence", "brainwashing", "rampant violence", "fed up", "disturbed", "forcing", "left-wing", "wreak havoc", "absolute horror", "enslaved".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – While "collectivist agenda" is used negatively, it doesn't explicitly link the ideas to a group universally hated by the audience (like Nazis) to invoke disapproval.
10. **Bandwagon – Yes** – "Homeschooling rates are skyrocketing", citing increased calls/emails to homeschooling organizations ("our numbers have doubled"), "so many have decided to educate their children themselves", implying popularity as a reason to join.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Attributes the complex problem of school violence primarily to "gun free zones" ("simply because they are gun free zones") and the complex issue of societal problems to government-run education ("what allowing the state to educate our children has done").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The language is inflammatory but generally clear about its accusations (social engineering, indoctrination, violence, unsafe environment). Terms like "collectivist agenda" are vague but defined within the context of the text's narrative.
13. **Appeal to authority – Yes** – Cites "The Washington Times", "Natural News", "Texas Home School Coalition" president Tim Lambert, "Homeschool Louisiana" head Christopher Chin, and researcher Brian D. Ray to lend credibility to the claims about homeschooling growth and reasons.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents public schools as universally dangerous, indoctrinating, failing, and horrifying, while positioning homeschooling as the solution that "takes care of that problem". The final paragraph starkly contrasts government education (enslavement, horror) with the implied alternative (freedom, morality).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Phrases like "leftist social engineering", "brainwashing and indoctrination", "collectivist agenda", "authoritarian policies", and "gun free zones" are used to shut down critical analysis of the complex issues of education, violence, and government. They label phenomena in a way that discourages deeper examination.
16. **Red herring – No** – The text stays focused on its core grievances against public schools (violence, curriculum, environment, government control). There isn't an obvious introduction of irrelevant material to distract from this main theme.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Presents the public school curriculum as primarily about forcing kindergarteners to study "white privilege" and engaging in "brainwashing and indoctrination", which is a misrepresentation and oversimplification of typical public education goals and practices, making it easier to attack.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – The text doesn't deflect criticism of homeschooling or its proponents by accusing critics of hypocrisy on other issues. It focuses solely on attacking public schools.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a wide array of techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Bandwagon, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-Terminating Clichés, Straw Men) to present a highly biased, emotionally charged, and one-sided argument. Its primary goal is not balanced information but to vilify public schools and government education ("social engineering," "brainwashing," "indoctrination," "violence," "horror," "enslavement") and promote homeschooling as the only reasonable alternative by appealing to parental fear and distrust. The language is consistently inflammatory, it simplifies complex issues, uses questionable sources to bolster claims, and creates a stark "us vs. them" narrative. While it addresses genuine concerns some parents have, the presentation is manipulative and designed to provoke a strong emotional reaction (fear, anger) rather than encourage critical thinking about education options. The near-universal application of multiple propaganda techniques leaves little doubt about its nature.
