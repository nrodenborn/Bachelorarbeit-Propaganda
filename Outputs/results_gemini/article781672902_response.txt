Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The author uses insulting labels such as “presstitutes” to refer to the media, “whores” to describe journalists, and calls specific figures like AG Sessions “weak and stupid.”
2.  Repetition – Yes – The central idea that “Russiagate is an orchestration” or a “conspiracy” is repeated multiple times throughout the text, as is the term “military/security complex” to reinforce the identity of the alleged conspirators.
3.  Slogans – Yes – The phrase “Russiagate is an orchestration” is used as a concise, memorable summary of the author’s central thesis.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text repeatedly warns that the actions of the “military/security complex” and the “Russiagate ‘investigation’” are creating a situation where the “danger of nuclear war is today far higher than ever” and could result in “nuclear Armageddon” or “the end of life on earth.”
5.  Doubt – Yes – The author systematically questions the credibility of the Mueller investigation, stating, “Mueller, fully aware that there was no Trump-Putin conspiracy, has not bothered to look for any evidence as there can be no evidence of something that did not happen.” He also casts doubt on the justice system, saying, “American juries are notoriously incompetent.”
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the power of the “military/security complex” by stating it “is large enough to be a member of the G-20.” Conversely, he minimizes potential crimes, such as when he questions “how much of a crime it can be to misrepresent your financial position on a loan application.”
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of patriotism by framing the conflict as a conspiracy to “overthrow democracy in America” and positioning the author as a defender of “the American people who in their distress... elected Donald Trump their President.”
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is saturated with emotionally charged and stereotypical language, such as “hegemonic neoconservatives,” “Trump-hating presstitutes,” “misogynist white male,” and describing the Israeli army as “capable of nothing but murdering unarmed women and children.”
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler directly, the author uses a parallel technique by describing the Gaza Strip as “the largest concentration camp ever in the world,” a phrase deliberately chosen to evoke the horrors associated with the Nazi regime and apply that revulsion to Israel.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea. In fact, it does the opposite, presenting its own views as a minority opinion standing against a powerful and widely accepted conspiracy (“the entirety of the House and Senate of both parties is in thrall”).
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the entire complex phenomenon of the Russiagate investigation to a single cause: it “is the response of the military/security complex to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign statement that he intended to normalize relations with Russia.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s language is generally direct and blunt, not vague or obscure. He clearly states his accusations and names the individuals and groups he believes are responsible.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites several authorities to lend weight to his arguments, including “President Eisenhower,” “Stephen Cohen,” and quoting “Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz” at length to explain legal tactics.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark choice between Trump’s desire to “normalize relations with Russia” and the military/security complex’s agenda, which will lead to “nuclear Armageddon.” It leaves no room for alternative motivations or outcomes.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The author uses phrases to shut down discussion, such as, “The US military/security complex will not permit any normalization of relations with Russia. Period.” The addition of “Period” is a classic way to signal that the point is not up for debate.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a lengthy and detailed attack on Israel, its military, and its policies in the Gaza Strip. While loosely tied to the “neoconservatives,” this section serves as a major distraction from the central topic of the Russiagate investigation.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author claims that the “presstitutes” are misrepresenting Manafort’s conviction as “vindication of the Russiagate investigation.” He then easily knocks down this simplified argument by stating the actual charges, refuting a caricature of the media’s position rather than its more nuanced reality.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – When discussing Manafort’s alleged financial misrepresentation, the author deflects by bringing up the 2008 financial crisis, asking why banks weren’t prosecuted for similar actions: “It is unclear how much of a crime it can be to misrepresent your financial position on a loan application when one of the causes of the mortgage-backed derivative crisis was the misrepresentation of mortgage applicants on the loan documents by the companies issuing the mortgages.”

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or present a balanced analysis, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific and highly conspiratorial worldview by employing a dense and overwhelming array of propaganda techniques. The author uses 16 of the 18 listed techniques.

The piece constructs a simple narrative of good versus evil: a besieged President Trump, who wants peace, is being targeted by a monolithic and evil "military/security complex" in league with Democrats and the media ("presstitutes"). To support this narrative, the author relies heavily on name-calling, loaded language, and appeals to fear (the threat of nuclear war) to create a strong emotional response in the reader.

It systematically employs causal oversimplification to attribute all events to a single, sinister motive. It casts doubt on every official institution—the justice system, the media, the FBI, and the political establishment—while simultaneously appealing to select authorities (Dershowitz, Eisenhower) who support its thesis. The argument is framed as a black & white fallacy, where the only alternative to supporting Trump against this conspiracy is "the end of life on earth." The consistent use of these techniques demonstrates that the text's goal is indoctrination into a particular viewpoint, not objective discourse.
