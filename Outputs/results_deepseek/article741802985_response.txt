Based on the definitions provided and the text analysis, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – "Willfully Ignorant FBI" (headline), "deep, deep corruption" (FBI), "Muslim Jihadi" (headline), "denial and deception" (FBI track record).
2.  **Repetition – Yes** – Repeated assertion that the FBI refuses to acknowledge a "global jihad" or that Islam is connected to terrorism: "...the FBI doesn’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism. It doesn’t admit that there is a war going on...", "This willful ignorance...".
3.  **Slogans – No** – No distinct, brief, memorable phrase is used repeatedly as a slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "We know that the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and other groups have called upon Muslims in the U.S. to try to kill military personnel and police, as well as civilians."; "...was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself."; Implies a widespread, ongoing threat ("war") that authorities deny.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – Explicitly questions the FBI's credibility and honesty: "given their track record of denial and deception, they may still be searching for Kazi’s motive"; "The FBI’s bafflement here is part of its deep, deep corruption."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration: "deep, deep corruption" (FBI), "diversion and waste of resources that is astronomical and catastrophic." Minimization: Downplays the possibility of other motives by insisting the Islamic terror link is the only logical one ("probably this has something to do with the global jihad").
7.  **Flag-Waving – Yes** – Uses the WWII Battle of the Bulge analogy: "It’s as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier... to see if each one’s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler’s war aims." This appeals to American patriotism and wartime unity against a clear enemy.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – "Muslim Jihadi" (headline), "global jihad", "Islamic terror", "willful ignorance", "deep, deep corruption", "denial and deception". These words carry strong negative connotations and evoke specific stereotypes and emotions.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes** – Explicitly compares the perceived enemy (Islamic terrorists) and the FBI's approach to them to Nazi Germany and Hitler: "...as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier... to see if each one’s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler’s war aims."
10. **Bandwagon – No** – Does not appeal to the popularity of the idea (e.g., "Everyone knows...", "Most people agree...").
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Assumes the simple cause (Islamic terrorism motivated by global jihad) for the complex event (the attack), dismissing other potential motives or complexities the FBI might be investigating: "when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad."
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – The text is very direct and opinionated, not deliberately vague or confusing.
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – The text attacks authority (FBI) rather than using its support. No external authority is cited favorably.
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – Presents only two options: either the attack is part of the "global jihad" (as the author insists) or the FBI is treating it as a "separate and discrete criminal event, unrelated to all the others." Ignores other potential motives or complex explanations.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Phrases like "willful ignorance" and "deep, deep corruption" are used to dismiss the FBI's position and discourage critical examination of the FBI's actual investigative process or alternative explanations.
16. **Red herring – No** – The core argument focuses on the attack and the FBI's response. No obviously irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men – Yes** – Misrepresents the FBI's position: "The FBI doesn’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism. It doesn’t admit that there is a war going on, and treats each act of Islamic terror as if it were a separate and discrete criminal event..." The FBI statement quoted only says they haven't found a *nexus to terrorism **in this specific case*** at this point and are still investigating. The author refutes this exaggerated, absolute denial of any connection ever.
18. **Whataboutism – No** – Does not charge the opponent (FBI) with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions or inconsistencies on unrelated matters.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a significant number of propaganda techniques (11 out of 18 identified, including core techniques like Name Calling, Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Flag-Waving, Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy, Straw Men, Thought-terminating clichés, and Reduction ad Hitlerum). The core purpose is not to objectively report on the Travis AFB incident or the FBI's investigation, but to promote a specific, highly charged narrative: that Islamic terrorism motivated by a global jihad is a clear and present danger, and that the FBI is corrupt and willfully ignorant for not immediately attributing this specific attack to that cause. The language is inflammatory, relies heavily on stereotypes ("Muslim Jihadi"), attacks the credibility of officials, oversimplifies complex issues, uses historical analogy to evoke strong emotion, and dismisses any alternative viewpoint or investigative process as corrupt "willful ignorance." While it reports some factual details (via the embedded LA Times excerpt), the framing, commentary, and headline are designed to manipulate the reader's perception and emotions towards a predetermined conclusion.
