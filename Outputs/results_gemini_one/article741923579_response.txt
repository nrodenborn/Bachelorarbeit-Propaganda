1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the FBI’s actions as “deep, deep corruption” and the overall situation as a “comic opera.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly insists that the motive is obvious (jihad) and that the FBI is baffled or willfully ignorant, using phrases such as “real mystery,” “complete mystery,” and stating that the FBI is “back at Square One” with each event.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases as rallying cries.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text ends with a graphic and fearful hypothetical: “If the jihadis advance even into the FBI’s Sacramento offices, will agents there be struggling to determine the jihadis’ motive even as the machete begins to slice through their necks?”
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is constructed to cast doubt on the competence and integrity of the FBI. Example: “And that in a nutshell shows what’s wrong with today’s FBI.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author exaggerates the FBI’s procedural caution into a catastrophic institutional failure, suggesting they would be unable to determine motive even while being physically attacked.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The argument is framed around the protection of the United States, referencing a “U.S. Air Force Base” and threats against “military personnel and police” to appeal to a sense of patriotism and national security.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like “800-pound gorilla,” “comic opera,” and “machete begins to slice through their necks” to provoke an emotional response rather than a rational one.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The author compares the FBI’s investigation to a hypothetical failure to understand the motives of the German army during WWII: “It’s as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier who crashed through the Ardennes Forest... to see if each one’s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler’s war aims.”
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular and should be adopted for that reason; rather, it presents itself as a dissenting voice against an official narrative.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author insists on a single, simple cause for the event (the “global jihad”) and dismisses or ridicules other complex factors, such as mental health. Example: “when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s message is direct and clear, not intentionally vague. He accuses the FBI of obfuscation, but does not use it himself.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text ends with a biography of the author, Robert Spencer, identifying him as “the director of Jihad Watch and author of the New York Times bestsellers,” which serves to position him as an expert authority on the topic.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as having only two options: either the motive is obviously jihad, or the FBI is corrupt and willfully ignorant. It dismisses the possibility of nuance or other explanations. Example: “This willful ignorance leads to a diversion and waste of resources that is astronomical and catastrophic.”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase “the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the living room” to imply the motive is so obvious that any discussion of alternatives is absurd and should be shut down.
16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central argument and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the audience. It accuses the FBI of using mental health as a red herring, but does not employ the technique itself.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author misrepresents the FBI’s position. The FBI agent’s cautious statement, “We don’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point,” is reframed as a statement of complete and permanent bafflement, which is an easier position to attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text attacks the FBI for alleged incompetence and denial, but not for hypocrisy by pointing out a similar failing of their own.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint: that the FBI is dangerously incompetent and politically correct to the point of ignoring an obvious threat of Islamic terrorism. The article systematically employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. It uses Name Calling and Doubt to undermine the credibility of the FBI from the outset. It relies heavily on Causal Oversimplification and the Black & White Fallacy to present its preferred explanation as the only logical one, while dismissing any other possibilities (like mental health) as absurd. The argument is saturated with Loaded Language and a powerful Appeal to Fear to create a strong emotional response in the reader. The author uses a Straw Man argument by exaggerating the FBI's cautious statements into a caricature of incompetence, and then uses Reduction ad Hitlerum to equate this perceived incompetence with a failure to recognize the Nazis. The sheer density and combination of these techniques, all aimed at a single persuasive goal while discouraging critical thought, confirm its nature as propaganda.
