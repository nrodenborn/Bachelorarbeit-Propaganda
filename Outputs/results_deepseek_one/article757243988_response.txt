### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Submission to Allah" (insinuates forced religious conversion).

3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases used.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Implies Islam is being forced on children: "schoolchildren being forced to make professions of faith."  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions the school’s claims: "Penkoski and his daughter contested Branch’s claims."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggerates with "forced" (assignment was optional) and minimizes school’s interfaith curriculum.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to Christian identity: "Christian Parent Furious," positioning Islam as "other."

13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Uses quotes from Penkoski (Christian parent) as evidence against the school.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents Islam as uniquely favored: "only ever used regarding Islam" vs. other religions.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Now, why is that?" shuts down critical analysis.

17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Misrepresents assignment as "forced submission" (it was optional calligraphy practice).

### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to:  
1. **Agenda-Driven Framing**: Selectively presents the Islamic assignment as "forced submission" while downplaying identical interfaith curriculum elements (e.g., omitting that Christianity/Judaism were also taught).  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Uses fear ("forced professions of faith"), loaded language ("furious," "disturbed"), and Christian identity appeals to incite outrage.  
3. **Distortion of Facts**: Exaggerates the assignment as coercive despite evidence it was optional; falsely claims other religions weren’t covered equitably.  
4. **Misleading Tactics**: Employs red herrings (irrelevant Democrat poll), straw men (misrepresenting the school’s intent), and whataboutism (accusing schools of Islamic favoritism).  
5. **Systematic Bias**: Omits counter-evidence (e.g., principal’s detailed account of Christian curriculum) while amplifying unverified parental claims.  

The text fits classic propaganda: it simplifies a complex issue into an "us vs. them" narrative, weaponizes religious identity, and manipulates emotions to rally readers against perceived ideological threats.
