Name calling – Yes – The text labels Jeff Sessions a “weak sister” and refers to Mueller’s prosecutors as a “disgrace to USA.”
Repetition – Yes – The phrase “Sessions is a weak sister. He has to go.” is used twice in quick succession. The term “witch hunt” is also repeated throughout the text.
Slogans – Yes – The text uses the phrase “Rigged Witch Hunt,” which is a brief and memorable phrase used to frame the investigation.
Appeal to fear – Yes – The text describes the investigation as a “stealth coup,” a term designed to instill fear of a subversive, illegitimate threat to the presidency.
Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on the special counsel’s credibility, stating, “Bob Mueller is totally conflicted.”
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by describing the investigation as a “stealth coup” and the Trump campaign as “one of the most successful in history.”
Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by stating that the prosecutors are a “disgrace to USA,” framing the opposition as anti-American.
Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “dirty work,” “weak sister,” and “Rigged Witch Hunt” to appeal to the reader’s emotions.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or the Nazis.
Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea should be supported because it is popular.
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple cause for the complex investigation, claiming it was only proceeding “‘because Jeff Sessions didn’t tell me he was going to recuse himself.’”
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text’s language is direct and forceful rather than being deliberately unclear or obscure.
Appeal to authority – Yes – The article centers its entire argument on the statements of an authority figure, President Trump, presenting his tweets as de facto evidence. Example: “‘Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now,’ the president tweeted.”
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll included in the text presents only two options: “* Yes, he will be confirmed. No, he will not be confirmed,” eliminating any other possible outcomes.
Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like “Rigged Witch Hunt” and “TOTAL HOAX” are used to shut down discussion and dismiss the subject without engaging with its complexities.
Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of a poll about Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation is a classic red herring, as it is entirely irrelevant to the article’s topic of the Mueller investigation and serves as a distraction.
Straw men – Yes – The text reduces the entire complex investigation to just “Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign” and then calls it a “TOTAL HOAX.” This misrepresents the full scope of the investigation to make it easier to attack.
Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects from the subject of the investigation by accusing opponents of hypocrisy: “The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was... used to begin the Witch Hunt. Disgraceful!”

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly biased viewpoint by employing a vast array of manipulative techniques. The article utilizes 15 of the 18 listed propaganda methods. It is saturated with loaded language ("dirty work," "stealth coup"), name-calling ("weak sister," "disgrace"), and repetition to create a strong emotional response against the Mueller investigation and Jeff Sessions. It relies heavily on an appeal to authority by centering the entire piece on Donald Trump's tweets, presenting them as fact. Furthermore, it employs logical fallacies like causal oversimplification, straw men, and a red herring (the Kavanaugh poll) to distract from and misrepresent the core issues. The cumulative effect of these techniques is to delegitimize a formal investigation, portray the president as a victim of a political conspiracy, and rally support by appealing to emotion and patriotism rather than reason and evidence.
