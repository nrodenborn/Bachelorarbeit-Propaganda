### Verdict – 85% – Explanation:  
The text is highly likely to be propaganda due to its systematic use of manipulative techniques. It employs **name-calling** ("war is deceit"), **repetition** (Kavanaugh poll), **appeal to fear** (school shooters/WTC links), **loaded language** ("filthy," "smear"), and **straw men** to vilify the Imam and journalists. It **oversimplifies causality** (blaming "journalists who hate Islam") and uses **thought-terminating clichés** ("Ever the victim") to stifle nuance. The **red herring** (Kavanaugh poll) further distracts from substantive discussion. While not every technique is present, the text’s framing—dismissing critics as bigoted while omitting counter-evidence—aligns with propaganda’s goal of shaping perception rather than informing. The source’s bias (Robert Spencer, a known anti-Islam activist) and selective reporting (ignoring the mosque spokesman’s rebuttal) reinforce this assessment.
