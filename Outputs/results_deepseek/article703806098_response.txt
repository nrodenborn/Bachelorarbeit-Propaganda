Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – While critical of the official story ("cover-up," "complete nonsense"), the text doesn't use insulting labels specifically attacking individuals or groups directly responsible. "Cover-up" targets the *action*, not a specific person/group with an epithet.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The core message of "multiple shooters" and a "cover-up" is repeated throughout the text ("multiple active shooters," "proof that multiple shooters," "contradicts the official story," "entire narrative... is complete nonsense," "authorities are actually actively covering up").
3.  **Slogans** – No – The text does not employ a brief, memorable phrase designed for easy recall and repetition (like "Make America Great Again"). The quoted ATC phrase is presented as evidence, not a crafted slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text strongly implies that the authorities cannot be trusted and are hiding a dangerous truth ("widespread cover-up," "authorities are actually actively covering up," "American people are clearly not being told the truth"), instilling fear about government deception and the true nature of the event.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The entire text is structured to systematically question the credibility of the official narrative ("directly contradicts the official story," "entire narrative... is complete nonsense," "contradicted the official narrative," "American people are clearly not being told the truth").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "Countless stories" exaggerates the prevalence and credibility of alternative theories. Minimization is less direct, but dismissing the official narrative as "complete nonsense" minimizes its validity without substantive counter-evidence beyond disputed claims.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its claims. It criticizes authorities but doesn't frame it as a patriotic duty to believe the alternative narrative.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to evoke strong reactions and sway opinion: "Bombshell," "striking example," "widespread cover-up," "stunning," "complete nonsense," "fateful night," "false flag," "astonishingly vivid," "shockingly," "clearly not being told the truth."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – The text does not attempt to discredit the official story by linking it to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – The text references "countless stories," "dozens of eyewitness reports," and "multiple investigative reports" to imply that many people believe the alternative theory, suggesting the reader should join this perceived majority.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text doesn't focus on explaining the *cause* of the event itself in a simplified way. It focuses on challenging the *description* of the event (number of shooters) and alleging a cover-up.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text's claims are actually quite direct and specific (multiple shooters, cover-up), even if unsupported. It names sources (Mike Tokes, Shepard Ambellas, Kymberley Suchomel) and quotes the ATC recording directly. It doesn't rely on deliberately unclear language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites Mike Tokes (political strategist) as the source of the ATC audio and Shepard Ambellas's "viral article" as the source for the Kymberley Suchomel story, using their platforms as evidence supporting the alternative narrative.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text presents the situation as a binary choice: either the official story (dismissed as "complete nonsense") is true, or the alternative theory of multiple shooters and a cover-up is true. It ignores any middle ground or complexities in the investigation.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – While dismissive ("complete nonsense"), the text doesn't use phrases specifically designed to shut down critical thought (like "it is what it is" or "don't question it"). It actually encourages questioning the official account.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The detailed discussion of Kymberley Suchomel's death shortly after her post ("natural causes") introduces a dramatic but ultimately irrelevant point. Her death, while potentially suspicious, does not provide evidence *for* multiple shooters or a cover-up; it distracts by implying a conspiracy to silence her without proving her claims were accurate.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text directly attacks the core claim of the official narrative (a lone gunman). It doesn't misrepresent or exaggerate that specific claim into an easier-to-refute position; it disputes it head-on with its own evidence (ATC audio, witness reports).
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge its opponents (authorities) with hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions or inconsistencies on unrelated issues. It focuses solely on the specific event and the alleged cover-up.

**Verdict – 90% – Explanation:** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques (Repetition, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Bandwagon, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Red Herring). Its primary function is not to neutrally report facts but to aggressively promote a specific, conspiracy-laden alternative narrative ("multiple shooters," "cover-up," possible "false flag") while systematically discrediting the official investigation. It achieves this through:
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** Using highly charged language ("bombshell," "stunning," "cover-up," "fateful night") and fear of government deception.
*   **Selective Evidence & Distraction:** Focusing solely on points challenging the official story (ATC audio, some witness reports), exaggerating their prevalence ("countless stories"), and introducing dramatic but unsubstantiated distractions (witness's death).
*   **False Dilemma:** Framing the issue as a simple choice between accepting a corrupt official lie or the presented alternative.
*   **Appeals to Popularity & Alternative Authority:** Suggesting many believe the alternative and citing figures like Mike Tokes and Shepard Ambellas as credible sources.
*   **Repetition:** Hammering the core messages of multiple shooters and a cover-up.
While it presents specific claims (ATC recording, witness account), it does so within a framework designed to persuade through emotion, suspicion, and the dismissal of opposing views rather than a balanced examination of evidence. The overwhelming use of these techniques strongly indicates the text functions as propaganda for a specific conspiracy narrative. The 10% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of cited sources (ATC quote, named individuals), even if their context and interpretation are heavily manipulated.
