1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the media as the "left-wing media" and describes the "hysteria of the left," which are labels used to dismiss their arguments.
2. Repetition – Yes – The central theme that "Trump has been far tougher on Russia than Obama was" is repeated multiple times throughout the article, including in the headline, in the main body, and in the concluding paragraph.
3. Slogans – Yes – The title itself, "Obama Was Never As Tough On Russia As Trump," acts as a brief, memorable phrase that encapsulates the entire argument of the piece.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not primarily support its ideas by instilling fear in the audience about alternatives; its focus is on refuting criticism of Trump's policies.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively seeks to create doubt about the credibility of Trump's critics, stating their arguments are "just silly" and that their criticism is "an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes President Obama's actions against Russia, describing his response as "weakness on a pathetic scale," while exaggerating the criticism against Trump as "hysteria of the left."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the debate around "protect[ing] America from Russian meddling" and strengthening NATO, implying that Trump's actions are more patriotic than those of his predecessor or critics.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "silly," "hand-wringing," "hysteria of the left," and "nastiness" to influence the audience's perception of Trump's critics.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular; in fact, it presents its view as being contrary to the mainstream media narrative.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the motives of former intelligence officials Brennan and Clapper, attributing their criticism of Trump solely to "an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America," ignoring other potential political or professional motivations.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article's main argument is presented directly and supported with specific, though selective, examples. It is not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on the opinions of authorities like "The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway" and "Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich" to validate its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy where Trump's policies are "tough" and Obama's were "weakness on a pathetic scale," ignoring any nuance or complexity in the foreign policy of either administration.
1s. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "This is just silly" at the start of the article is used to dismiss the opposing viewpoint without substantive argument. The line "People are obsessed about words and they should maybe focus on the actions as well" serves to shut down discussion about the significance of presidential rhetoric.
16. Red herring – Yes – The inclusion of a poll about Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation is completely irrelevant to the article's topic of US-Russia policy and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The article characterizes the argument against Trump as a simplistic belief that "he is some kind of Russian mole." This misrepresents the more nuanced and varied criticisms, which often focused on rhetoric and potential conflicts of interest, making the opposing view easier to attack.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – When addressing criticism from former intelligence officials, the text deflects by changing the subject to their own alleged failures: "the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump... are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016."

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques. The article begins by using name-calling ("left-wing media") and a straw man argument (the "Russian mole" theory) to caricature and dismiss all opposition. It then heavily relies on appeals to authority (Gingrich, Hemingway) and a black & white fallacy to build its case, presenting a one-sided narrative where Trump's actions are uniformly "tough" and Obama's were "pathetic." The use of whataboutism deflects criticism from former officials by shifting blame rather than addressing their points. The piece is saturated with loaded language ("hysteria," "nastiness") to evoke an emotional response and is framed by a thought-terminating cliché ("This is just silly") to discourage critical thought from the outset. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring poll about Brett Kavanaugh further underscores that the article's intent is not journalistic integrity but political persuasion and audience engagement for a specific agenda. While it presents factual points (e.g., sanctions, weapons sales), they are selected and framed within this propagandistic structure to support a predetermined conclusion.
