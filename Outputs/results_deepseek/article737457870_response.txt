Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Calypso Louie" (derogatory nickname for Farrakhan), sarcastic use of "civil rights hero" (TM).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated references to "Farrakhan" (15+ times), "embargo" (3 times), and Democrat ties to Farrakhan.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Implies Democrats endanger social harmony by associating with an anti-Semite (e.g., "blames everyone else for Davis' behavior," ties to "harmful and divisive views").  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Obama's sincerity ("That fails to explain why he met with him"), Davis' condemnation ("likely doesn't represent his views"), and Clyburn's stance ("declined to condemn").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates media avoidance ("media's Farrakhan embargo"), minimizes Obama's condemnations as insincere ("remix of his Wright speech").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or group identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Infamous" (photo and comment), "harmful and divisive views," "conspiracy theories," "shrug off criticisms," "embargo collapsing."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeals to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Reduces complex racial/political dynamics to simple guilt-by-association (e.g., attending events with Farrakhan = tacit endorsement of bigotry).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Language is direct and specific.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authoritative sources cited to support claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Implies association with Farrakhan is indefensible without nuance (e.g., refusal to condemn framed as moral failure).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to shut down discourse.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All content relates directly to Farrakhan ties.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy.  

---

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs multiple persuasive techniques (e.g., name-calling, fear appeals, loaded language) to advance a partisan narrative. The core argument—that Democratic leaders are morally compromised by ties to Farrakhan—is reinforced through selective evidence (e.g., highlighting Clyburn’s non-condemnation while downplaying Obama’s repudiations), insinuations of dishonesty ("remix of his Wright speech"), and exaggerated claims of media suppression ("embargo collapsing"). The tone is emotionally charged and derisive (e.g., sarcastic "civil rights hero" label), and the text omits counterpoints (e.g., context for interactions with Farrakhan). While based on factual events, the framing and rhetoric prioritize discrediting political opponents over balanced analysis, aligning with propaganda objectives. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the use of verifiable references (e.g., quotes from officials, news outlets).
