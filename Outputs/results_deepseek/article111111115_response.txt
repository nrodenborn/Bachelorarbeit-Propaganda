Here's the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against Franken or the accusers. Terms like "sexual misconduct" and "accusations" are factual descriptors.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The accusations are listed individually without repeating the same phrase excessively to drive a single message.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to summarize or promote a viewpoint.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text reports accusations and political pressure, but does not attempt to instill fear about alternatives to Franken's resignation.
5.  **Doubt** – No – While Franken denies some accusations, the text itself does not frame the accusations or denials in a way that primarily functions to cast doubt on their credibility. It presents both sides.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The descriptions of the accusations (e.g., "aggressively stuck his tongue," "grabbed her buttocks," "put his hand on her breast") are direct reports from the accusers. The text doesn't appear to amplify or downplay them beyond reporting what was alleged. Franken's denials are also reported neutrally.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or group identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – *Potential, but weak/No* – Words like "forcibly," "aggressively," and "groped" carry emotional weight, but they are direct quotes or factual descriptors of the *type* of accusation being made (sexual misconduct). The text avoids overtly inflammatory adjectives beyond reporting the allegations. *Explanation: While describing serious allegations inherently involves strong language, the text primarily uses terms directly related to the acts described rather than gratuitously emotional language aimed solely at provoking a reaction against Franken. It reports Franken's denials neutrally.*
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempt is made to link Franken or his actions to universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – *Yes* – "About 30 Senate Democrats, starting with women, have urged the Minnesota Democrat to step down." This highlights the growing number and political weight of those calling for resignation, appealing to the idea that it's the popular or necessary position within his party.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text simply reports events (accusations leading to calls for resignation leading to resignation) without assigning a simplistic cause to a complex situation.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific in listing the accusations, sources, and Franken's responses. Details like dates, locations, and specific alleged actions are provided where available.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While sources like HuffPost, Jezebel, and Politico are cited, this is standard reporting attribution, not using their status as proof the accusations are true. Franken's denials are given equal weight in the reporting.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents the situation as accusations, denials, and political pressure. It doesn't frame the issue as only having two extreme choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used to shut down critical thinking. The text presents information for the reader to consider.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the accusations against Franken and the political fallout. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented arguments are presented and refuted. The text reports actual accusations and actual denials.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No attempt is made to charge critics or accusers with hypocrisy regarding other matters.

**Verdict – 5% – Explanation:** The text is overwhelmingly straightforward news reporting. Its primary function is to list the specific accusations against Senator Franken, report his responses, and state the political consequence (resignation prompted by pressure from colleagues). The use of the "Bandwagon" technique (highlighting the number of Democrats calling for resignation) is present but relatively mild within the context of reporting a key political development – it explains *why* he resigned. The language, while describing serious allegations, uses terms directly relevant to the acts described ("groped," "forcibly kissed") rather than gratuitously inflammatory language. Franken's denials are consistently included. There is no overt attempt to manipulate the reader's emotions beyond the inherent seriousness of the subject matter, nor to misrepresent facts or arguments. The text serves an informational purpose, presenting allegations and responses from multiple sources. The 5% reflects the minor element of highlighting the political pressure ("Bandwagon") within an otherwise factual report.
