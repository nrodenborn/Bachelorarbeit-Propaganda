Certainly! Here’s the analysis for each propaganda technique according to your instructions:

---

**1. Name calling – No –** There are no insulting labels applied to any person or group in the text.

**2. Repetition – No –** The same message is not repeated over and over; the information is presented without significant repetition.

**3. Slogans – No –** There are no brief, memorable phrases used as slogans.

**4. Appeal to fear – Yes –** The text emphasizes the danger of the plague being airborne and spreading due to “dancing with corpses,” which could instill fear in the audience.  
*Example: “Since it’s airborne, anyone coming close to the corpse of a person who has died of the black death could themselves, catch the infection.”*

**5. Doubt – Yes –** The credibility of the government’s claims about the plague is questioned by some locals.  
*Example: “Some locals believe the whole plague is some kind of a government conspiracy, and say they have no intention of forgoing the ritual known as ‘famadihana.’”*

**6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes –** There are claims that the government is exaggerating the problem for financial gain.  
*Example: “Josephine Ralisiarisoa firmly believes the country’s cash-strapped government is just exaggerating the problem to get money ahead of an election next year.”*

**7. Flag-Waving – No –** There is no direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.

**8. Loaded Language – Yes –** Phrases like “literally ‘Dancing With Corpses’” and “The plague is a lie” are emotionally charged and designed to provoke a reaction.  
*Example: “The Plague Is AIRBORNE And It’s Spreading Because People Are Literally ‘Dancing With Corpses’”*

**9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No –** There is no comparison to Nazis or other universally hated groups.

**10. Bandwagon – No –** There is no appeal to popularity or suggestion that “everyone” is doing something.

**11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes –** The text suggests that the ritual of dancing with corpses is a major cause of the plague’s spread, which oversimplifies a complex epidemiological issue.  
*Example: “The local tradition is said to be one of the major causes of the spread of this disease.”*

**12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes –** The text uses vague attributions such as “is said to be” and “health officials suspect,” which are unclear and do not specify sources or evidence.  
*Example: “The local tradition is said to be one of the major causes…”*

**13. Appeal to authority – Yes –** The text quotes a health ministry official to support its claims.  
*Example: “said Willy Randriamarotia, Madagascar’s health ministry chief of staff.”*

**14. Black & white fallacy – Yes –** The text presents the issue as either participating in the ritual and risking plague, or not participating, without acknowledging other possibilities.  
*Example: “I will always practice the turning of the bones of my ancestors — plague or no plague. The plague is a lie.”*

**15. Thought-terminating clichés – No –** There are no clichés that shut down further discussion.

**16. Red herring – No –** The text does not introduce irrelevant material to distract from the main issue.

**17. Straw men – No –** The text does not misrepresent an opposing argument in order to refute it.

**18. Whataboutism – No –** There is no attempt to charge an opponent with hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 85% – The text exhibits numerous propaganda techniques, including appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, vagueness, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques work together to shape the reader’s perception of the plague outbreak and the local customs, as well as to cast doubt on government motives. The use of emotionally charged language and oversimplified causality, in particular, are strong indicators of propaganda. While not every technique is present, the density and variety of those that are make it highly likely (85%) that this text is propaganda.**
