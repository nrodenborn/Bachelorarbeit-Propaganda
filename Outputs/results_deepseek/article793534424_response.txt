3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as standalone slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Implies Powell’s appointment would continue "failed incoherent foreign policy" and enable threats (e.g., "cash for the Palestinian Authority" linked to Hezbollah).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions Powell’s loyalty: "Is it any wonder Habib Powell was a major White House source of the negative leaks?"  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates Powell’s influence ("deep part of the Republican establishment") and minimizes McMaster’s credibility ("devout jihadis were 'irreligious'").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to patriotism by contrasting Trump’s "vision" with "failed" Bush/Obama policies.

13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites Daniel Greenfield and Breitbart as sources for claims about Powell’s ties.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents Trump’s policies as good and Powell/McMaster’s as bad with no middle ground.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to halt critical discussion (e.g., "take our poll" is an invitation, not a cliché).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Focuses on Powell’s Clinton/Goldman Sachs ties, irrelevant to UN Ambassador qualifications.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents McMaster’s views: Claims he said terrorism has "nothing to do with Islam" (he argued against oversimplification).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Does not deflect by accusing opponents of hypocrisy.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic, employing **12 of 18 techniques** (e.g., name-calling, fear appeals, loaded language). It uses emotionally charged rhetoric ("swamp," "enemedia") to vilify Dina Habib Powell and H.R. McMaster, while oversimplifying complex foreign policy issues. The author selectively presents facts (e.g., Powell’s Clinton ties) to imply guilt by association, distorts McMaster’s views, and omits counter-evidence. Repetition of the poll question reinforces bias, and appeals to fear frame Powell as a threat to Trump’s agenda. The sourcing (Breitbart, Daniel Greenfield) lacks neutrality, and the piece’s goal is clearly to discredit Powell rather than inform. While it includes factual elements (e.g., Powell’s attendance at events), these are weaponized to advance a narrative. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the use of verifiable details (e.g., Powell’s Goldman Sachs role), but the text’s structure, tone, and techniques overwhelmingly align with propaganda.
