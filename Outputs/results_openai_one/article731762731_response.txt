Verdict – 20% – The text contains elements of doubt and appeal to authority, which are propaganda techniques. However, these elements are not dominant or pervasive throughout the text.

The presence of these techniques does not strongly suggest that the text is intended as propaganda, but rather as a news report with some critical viewpoints included.
