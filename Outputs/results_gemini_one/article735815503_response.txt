***

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. Its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade through emotional manipulation. This is evident from the very beginning with the headline, which combines name-calling, exaggeration, and doubt to immediately frame the mayor in a negative light. The article heavily relies on an appeal to fear and loaded language, selectively highlighting the most heinous crimes ("child sex crimes") to provoke an emotional response of fear and anger. Furthermore, it employs causal oversimplification by stating, "The price of a sanctuary city for illegal aliens is paid in abused children," which reduces a complex socio-political issue to a simplistic and terrifying cause-and-effect narrative. While the text uses factual data from ICE, it frames this data in a way that is entirely one-sided, omitting any alternative perspectives or context about sanctuary city policies. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to demonize a political opponent and a policy, which is a hallmark of propaganda.
