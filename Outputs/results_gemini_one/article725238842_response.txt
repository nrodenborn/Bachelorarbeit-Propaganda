Name calling – No – The text uses factual descriptors like "Mexican national" and "legal permanent resident alien male," which are not insulting labels.

Repetition – No – The text presents a sequence of events in a linear fashion without repeating a specific message.

Slogans – No – The text does not contain any brief, memorable phrases intended to be repeated.

Appeal to fear – No – The text reports on a past event and does not use fear to support an idea or warn against alternatives.

Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or organization.

Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text uses specific, factual language such as "a 9MM handgun" and "trace amounts of marijuana," avoiding hyperbole or understatement.

Flag-Waving – No – While the text involves a U.S. government agency, it does not use patriotic appeals to persuade the reader.

Loaded Language – No – The text uses neutral, official language like "referred for further inspection" and "seized." The term "Mexican national" is a factual descriptor of nationality, not an emotional appeal.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is popular or that the reader should agree with it because others do.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The text reports on a specific, singular event and does not attempt to explain complex societal issues with a simple cause.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is highly specific, providing details such as the location, age of the subject, type of vehicle, and items seized.

Appeal to authority – No – The text is a direct report from an authority (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) about its own actions, not an appeal to an external authority to validate a separate claim.

Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present a false dilemma or limit the reader to two choices.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any clichés intended to stop critical thought.

Red herring – No – All the information provided is directly relevant to the reported arrest.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute any opposing arguments.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing others of hypocrisy.

Verdict – 10% – The text itself is not propaganda as it is almost entirely devoid of the listed techniques. It reads as a factual, dispassionate press release from a government agency, detailing the who, what, where, and when of a law enforcement action. The language is clinical ("referred for further inspection," "a records check confirmed," "seized") and specific.

However, there is a very small chance it could be considered part of a larger propaganda effort depending on its context and dissemination. The act of selecting and publicizing this specific story—which involves a foreign national, a weapon, drugs, and a stolen vehicle—could be used to support a broader political narrative about border security. The headline, "Arizona Border Patrol Nabs Armed Mexican National," is slightly more sensational than the body of the report and selectively highlights the nationality and armed status of the individual. While the article itself is factual, its framing and promotion could serve a propagandistic purpose. Therefore, in isolation, the text is a factual report, but its potential use gives it a very low likelihood of being classified as propaganda.
