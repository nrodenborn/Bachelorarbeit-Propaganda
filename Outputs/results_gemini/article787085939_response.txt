1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the police officer, Amber Guyger, as a “killer cop” and a “homicidal cop.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the word “smear” or the phrase “smear campaign” to describe the actions of the police. The unrelated poll about Nikki Haley is also repeated three times.
3. Slogans – Yes – The headline, “Dallas Police Attempt to ‘Smear’ Botham Jean Over Tiny Bit of Weed and they Failed, Miserably,” functions as a brief, memorable phrase that encapsulates the article's entire viewpoint.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The article primarily appeals to emotions like anger and injustice regarding a past event, rather than instilling fear in the audience about a future alternative.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is structured to cast doubt on the credibility of the police department and their official narrative, for example, by questioning the officer’s story: “Why did she have to go outside to verify the address? It makes no sense whatsoever.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the marijuana found as a “tiny bit of weed” while sarcastically exaggerating the finding of a grinder with the phrase “—the horror.”
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use appeals to patriotism or national identity to support its argument.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases throughout, such as “gunned down,” “insidiously planned,” “homicidal cop,” and “reprehensible” to provoke an emotional response from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or Nazis to discredit the police.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that its viewpoint is the popular one, stating, “Despite cops rallying behind the blue line to defend this killer cop, the rest of the country is not buying it.”
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The article presents a single, simple cause for the police releasing the search warrant details: “It is standard procedure for police to dig up dirt on their victims in attempts to smear and assassinate their character to make the killer cops look good in the public eye,” ignoring any other potential, more complex factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article’s language is direct and pointed in its accusations rather than being deliberately unclear.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly quotes the family’s attorneys, Lee Merritt and Daryl Washington, presenting their interpretations as expert evidence to support its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The article presents the situation as a simple binary: the police are engaged in a malicious “smear campaign” against a completely innocent victim. It leaves no room for nuance or alternative explanations for the police's actions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like “killer cop” and “cops rallying behind the blue line” which serve to frame the subjects in a simplistic, negative light that discourages deeper critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text contains a poll, “Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?”, which is completely irrelevant to the article and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The article refutes an argument that the police did not make, stating the police found marijuana “as if this justifies going into someone’s home and murdering them.” The police were accused of character defamation, not of presenting a legal justification for the killing.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text employs this technique by quoting an attorney who deflects from the information released about Jean by asking what about the officer: “I would love to see more information coming out about the warrants executed on the home of the shooter... I haven’t seen any of those.”

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. While it reports on a real event, its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint of the Dallas Police Department. It achieves this by employing a vast array of propaganda techniques. The article uses loaded language (“gunned down,” “homicidal cop”) and name-calling (“killer cop”) to create an emotional response of anger and outrage. It establishes a black-and-white fallacy, portraying the police as purely malicious conspirators and Botham Jean as a flawless victim. The author heavily relies on casting doubt on the official police narrative and uses appeals to authority (the family’s lawyers) to validate its own version of events. Furthermore, it employs techniques like whataboutism, causal oversimplification, and straw man arguments to control the narrative and discredit the opposing side without engaging in a nuanced discussion of the facts. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion rather than present objective information.
