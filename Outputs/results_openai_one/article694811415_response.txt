**4. Appeal to fear – No –** The text does not directly try to instill fear against alternatives.

### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 80% – The text exhibits several classic propaganda techniques, including sowing doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, obfuscation, and appeal to authority. It promotes a conspiratorial alternative to the mainstream narrative without substantial evidence, relying on the testimony of a neighbor and vague claims. The intent appears to be to cast suspicion on the official story and encourage readers to question or reject it, which are hallmarks of propaganda. However, it does not use all possible techniques, and some elements (such as the final paragraph acknowledging that neighbors often express disbelief after such events) provide a minimal counterbalance. Overall, the likelihood that this text is propaganda is high.**
