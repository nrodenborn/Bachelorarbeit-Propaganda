1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels politicians as “corrupt career politicians that are completely and utterly out of control.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the $15,000,000 figure multiple times and reiterates the theme of deep corruption and the need to “drain the swamp” or “take our government back.”
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the well-known political slogan “drain the swamp once and for all” and the phrase “it is time to take our government back.”
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that if the “status quo” continues, America will remain a “bad joke” that the “rest of the world is laughing at.” The final line, “Take a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare,” is a direct and ominous appeal to fear.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the integrity of the entire political system with rhetorical questions like, “If members of Congress are engaged in this type of behavior, why don’t the American people know about it?”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text describes politicians as “completely and utterly out of control” and labels alleged behavior from Joe Biden as “Weinstein-level,” which is a dramatic exaggeration to evoke a strong emotional response.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism with phrases like “it is time to take our government back from the corrupt career politicians” and the idea that America is “supposed to serve as an example to the rest of the world.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words such as “deeply disturbing,” “disgusting,” “corrupt career politicians,” and “shameful behavior” to influence the reader's emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with hated groups like Nazis to discredit it.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text claims, “The American people are not going to put up with this any longer,” creating the impression of a widespread movement that the reader should join.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests that the complex problems in Washington are caused simply by “corrupt career politicians” and that the solution is to “drain the swamp,” which oversimplifies a multifaceted issue.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its accusations and messaging, not deliberately unclear or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the authority of U.S. Representatives Jackie Speier and Barbara Comstock, as well as news outlets like CNN and Breitbart, to support its claims.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a choice between the unacceptable “status quo” and the author’s solution to “drain the swamp once and for all,” ignoring other potential solutions or nuances.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like “drain the swamp” are used as a substitute for a nuanced discussion about political reform, discouraging deeper critical thought on the complexities of the issue.
16. Red herring – Yes – The article begins by discussing sexual harassment in the House of Representatives, but then introduces accusations against former Vice-President Joe Biden, who was part of the executive branch. This serves to distract from the original topic and focus blame on a specific political figure.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that was not presented by an opponent; it focuses on making its own assertions.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – After establishing sexual harassment as a bipartisan issue in Congress (“Republican and Democrat”), the text pivots to a lengthy and detailed attack on a specific Democrat, Joe Biden. This functions as a form of whataboutism, deflecting from the general institutional problem to a specific political opponent.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. While it is built around a core of factual reporting (citing statements from elected officials and news outlets), its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade and incite an emotional response for a political purpose. This is evident through the extensive use of propaganda techniques. The article employs loaded language, name-calling, and appeals to fear to create outrage. It uses slogans and thought-terminating clichés ("drain the swamp") to offer a simple solution to a complex problem. Crucially, the text reveals its political motive with the line, “When I am elected to Congress, I am going to make fighting this sort of predatory behavior a top priority,” reframing the entire piece as a campaign message. The strategic use of a red herring (pivoting from a congressional issue to accusations against Joe Biden) further demonstrates its goal of targeting a political opponent rather than conducting a neutral investigation of an issue. The combination of these techniques, all aimed at a specific political outcome, moves the text from journalism to clear propaganda.
