Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Examples: "constitution-hating," "tyrannical tendencies," "enemy to privacy," "Gestapo like police state," "enemy of the Fourth Amendment."
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Example: The phrase "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively in the poll section. The Fourth Amendment violations are also a repeated theme.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – While hashtags like #StoptheNDAA and #4thAmendment are used, they are not presented as core, repeated slogans driving the main message within the article text itself.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Example: The text repeatedly warns that Kavanaugh's views will lead to loss of privacy, government spying without warrants ("track you, spy on you, and dig through your personal life"), and a "Gestapo like police state."
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Example: The text casts doubt on the focus and handling of the sexual misconduct allegations, calling it a "distraction," a "mudslinging orgy," and a "facade and media distraction," implying it's not the real issue or is being manipulated.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** (Exaggeration) – Example: Describing potential government surveillance as a "Gestapo like police state" is a severe exaggeration and historical comparison. Minimizing the sexual misconduct allegations as merely a "distraction" also fits.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Example: The text heavily appeals to American identity and values centered on the Constitution, the Bill of Rights (specifically the 1st and 4th Amendments), civil liberties, and freedom/privacy, framing Kavanaugh as an enemy of these core principles.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Examples: Numerous emotionally charged terms are used: "constitution-hating," "tyrannical," "mudslinging orgy," "victim shaming," "kangaroo courts," "Gestapo like police state," "enemy," "disposable nature of the constitution," "facade," "champion of the police and surveillance state," "harsh words," "blindly supporting."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Example: Directly comparing potential government actions under Kavanaugh's legal philosophy to the "Gestapo."
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text does not primarily argue that Kavanaugh should be rejected *because* it's the popular thing to do. It focuses on the alleged dangers of his record.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The text provides specific legal cases and interpretations (GPS tracking, NSA metadata) to support its claims about Kavanaugh's views, rather than attributing complex issues to a single, simplistic cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The arguments against Kavanaugh, while strongly worded, cite specific rulings, dissents, and quotes. The points about the 4th Amendment are explained with references to cases and his stated opinions.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Example: The text cites Senator Rand Paul, Liza Goitein (Brennan Center), Representative Justin Amash, and Judge Andrew Napolitano to support its claims about Kavanaugh's record and the dangers it poses.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – While strongly critical, the text acknowledges the existence of other issues (sexual misconduct allegations, views on abortion, guns, regulations) but argues the 4th Amendment issue is paramount. It doesn't present only two absolute choices for all considerations.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – The text uses strong arguments and cited examples rather than simplistic phrases designed to shut down thought. It encourages consideration of the 4th Amendment issue.
16. **Red herring** – **No** – The core argument (Kavanaugh's 4th Amendment record) is the main focus. While it dismisses the sexual misconduct focus as a distraction, it doesn't introduce an *irrelevant* topic to divert *from its own main point*.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks Kavanaugh's actual documented legal opinions and rulings on the 4th Amendment (GPS, NSA metadata, "special need"), supported by citations. It doesn't misrepresent his position to make it easier to attack.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not defend Kavanaugh's 4th Amendment record by accusing critics of hypocrisy on other issues. It focuses squarely on his record.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques, particularly **Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language, Flag-Waving, Reduction ad Hitlerum, Appeal to Authority, and Repetition**. Its primary goal is not balanced analysis but to vehemently oppose Kavanaugh's confirmation by framing him as a dangerous enemy of core constitutional rights (especially the 4th Amendment) and a threat to liberty, while dismissing other concerns (sexual misconduct allegations) as a manipulative distraction. The language is overwhelmingly inflammatory and emotionally manipulative ("Gestapo," "tyrannical," "enemy," "spy on you"), designed to provoke fear and outrage rather than foster objective consideration. The use of authoritative quotes is selective to support this negative framing. While it cites specific cases, these are presented within a highly biased and alarmist narrative, making the text overwhelmingly propagandistic in nature.
