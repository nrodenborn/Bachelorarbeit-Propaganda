Name calling – No – The text uses factual descriptions such as "officer who killed Botham Jean" rather than insulting labels to attack a subject.

Repetition – No – The text presents a chronological report of events and does not repeat a single message or phrase to reinforce a point.

Slogans – No – The text is a news report and does not use any brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea.

Appeal to fear – No – The article reports on events and public criticism without attempting to instill fear in the reader about alternative outcomes.

Doubt – Yes – The text actively questions the credibility of the police department and its chief. Explanation: The article states, "This contradicted the police chief’s recent statements," "The delay raised questions about why investigators held off on arresting the officer," and "Police Chief U. Reneé Hall gave contradictory explanations."

Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text presents information and statistics, such as "one of more than 700 police killings," by attributing them to a source (The Washington Post), which is a factual reporting method, not an exaggeration or minimization.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make any appeals to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – No – The language used is largely neutral and journalistic. Phrases like "fatal shooting" and "sparked criticism" describe the situation factually rather than using emotionally charged words to manipulate the reader.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text mentions "repeated protests" as a factual part of the event's timeline, not as an appeal for the reader to join a popular movement.

Causal Oversimplification – No – The article does the opposite; it highlights the complexities of the case, including the contradictory statements and the unresolved legal questions, rather than providing a simple cause for the events.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is written with clarity. It points out the vagueness and contradictions in the statements made by the police chief, rather than being vague itself.

Appeal to authority – No – The text cites authorities (the police chief, court documents, other news outlets) to report information and attribute statements, often to highlight inconsistencies. It does not use their status as evidence that what they are saying is inherently true.

Black & white fallacy – No – The article presents multiple perspectives and complexities, including the officer's account, the victim's family's dispute, and various statements from the police, avoiding a simple two-sided framing.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text encourages critical thought by pointing out unanswered questions and inconsistencies, such as "Police did not explain what changed by Monday."

Red herring – No – All information presented in the text is directly relevant to the case of Amber Guyger and the Dallas Police Department's handling of it.

Straw men – No – The text reports on the actual arguments and statements made by the parties involved and points out contradictions, rather than misrepresenting an argument to refute it.

Whataboutism – No – The article remains focused on the specific case and does not attempt to deflect criticism by bringing up unrelated issues or accusing others of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 5% – The text is characteristic of a standard news report, not propaganda. Its primary purpose is to inform the public about a sequence of events by presenting facts, attributing information to sources, and detailing the timeline. While it does employ the "Doubt" technique by questioning the official statements of the Dallas Police Chief, this is a fundamental practice of investigative journalism, which aims to hold authority accountable. The article lacks the manipulative and emotionally-charged characteristics of propaganda; it does not use loaded language, fear appeals, or logical fallacies to push a specific agenda. Instead, it encourages critical thinking by highlighting inconsistencies and unanswered questions in a matter-of-fact tone.
