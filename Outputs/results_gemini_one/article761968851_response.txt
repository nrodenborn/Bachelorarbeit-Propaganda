1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the previous administration as the "Obama Regime," which is a label with negative, authoritarian connotations, rather than the neutral "Obama administration."
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the decline in the immigrant population and the corresponding benefits for American workers. The phrase "ADVANTAGE AMERICANS" is also repeated to reinforce a point.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses "TRUMP EFFECT!" as a headline and a central theme, and also uses the capitalized phrase "ADVANTAGE AMERICANS" as a punchy, memorable slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear of the alternative by describing the previous administration's era as one of "damage," where an "unreported illegal alien surge was underway" and "Native-born American workers lost ground to their foreign-born competitors."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the reality of the situation under the previous administration by stating, "...which I argued meant that an unreported illegal alien surge was underway," casting doubt on the official narrative of the time.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration with phrases like "Native-born American employment rose a whopping 349,000" and "blue-collar wages have begun to rocket." It also minimizes other issues by stating, "Forget the Wolff book brouhaha and Trump’s latest DACA dalliance."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The entire article appeals to patriotism by framing the economic data as a competition between "Native-born American workers" and immigrants, and repeatedly concludes with "ADVANTAGE AMERICANS."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like "Obama Regime," "brouhaha," "dalliance," "illegal alien surge," and "DACA capitulation" to influence the reader's emotions.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not contain any comparisons to Nazis or other groups widely hated by the target audience.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests a positive trend is underway, stating that a "turnaround in fortunes for the middle class" has begun and that a decline in the foreign-born population is a "trend that began in September," encouraging readers to support the perceived momentum.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The article attributes complex economic outcomes, such as job growth and unemployment rates, to a single, simple cause: the "TRUMP EFFECT!", which is presented as the direct result of his administration's actions.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text hedges its own claims with vague statements like, "Of course, this could be affected by statistical noise," which allows it to present a strong conclusion while providing an escape route if the data changes.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites several sources to appear credible, including "the Labor Department," "a study by the Center for Immigration Studies," "The Economist," and "CNNMoney."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the economy as a zero-sum game between two distinct groups: "Native-born American workers" and "foreign-born competitors." It also creates a stark contrast between the positive "Trump Era" and the negative "Obama years."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the cliché, "the real story is outside the Beltway , where real people live and work," to dismiss political complexities and suggest the author has a more authentic perspective.
16. Red herring – Yes – The article begins by introducing and immediately dismissing two unrelated, controversial topics: "Forget the Wolff book brouhaha and Trump’s latest DACA dalliance," distracting from those issues to focus the reader on the author's preferred narrative.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text reframes the measure of success by stating, "Trump may not have delivered (yet) on his promise to bring back the factory and coal jobs... But by shrinking the pool of immigrants... he has put more money in pockets of his voters." This counters a weaker argument (he helped in a different way) rather than the stronger one (he didn't fulfill his specific promise).
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text uses a comparative form of whataboutism to praise Trump by contrasting his alleged achievements with Obama's alleged failures, for example: "By removing foreign competitors, Trump may have done more for blacks in 11 months than Obama did in eight years."

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast majority (17 out of 18) of the listed techniques to promote a specific political viewpoint. The article is not a neutral analysis of economic data; rather, it selectively presents and interprets information through a biased lens. It uses loaded language, slogans, and logical fallacies like causal oversimplification and the black & white fallacy to construct a narrative that the "TRUMP EFFECT!" is solely responsible for positive economic trends, particularly for "American workers" at the expense of immigrants. The constant framing of the issue as a conflict between Americans and foreigners, combined with appeals to patriotism and fear, firmly establishes the text as a piece of political propaganda.
