### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text  
**1. Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text uses insulting labels like "habitual liar," "confidence trickster," "grifter," and "professional confidence trickster" to attack Pope Francis.  
**2. Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "no evidence" is repeated multiple times (e.g., "no evidence against Barros," "no evidence for Ricca’s homosexual activity") to reinforce the accusation of papal dishonesty.  
**3. Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "Lie big, lie often" (referencing Hitler's propaganda tactic) is used as a memorable, accusatory slogan against the Pope.  
**4. Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text warns of societal disintegration and loss of faith, instilling fear about the Pope’s impact (e.g., "how long before that predictable disintegration occurs?").  
**5. Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The Pope’s credibility is repeatedly questioned (e.g., "the pope lied," "truth... means nothing to him").  
**6. Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: The Pope’s apologies are minimized as insincere ("apologised-except-not-really"), while his actions are exaggerated as part of a pattern of "brazen lies."  
**7. Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: No appeals to patriotism or group identity are present. The focus is on institutional, not national/group loyalty.  
**8. Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Emotionally charged terms like "predatory homosexual," "sex-predator," "vicious temper tantrums," and "blatantly anti-clerical" manipulate emotions and stereotypes.  
**9. Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text compares the Pope’s tactics to Hitler’s ("Lie big, lie often"), implying alignment with a universally hated figure.  
**10. Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to popularity by noting "a vast array of voices, secular and Catholic, left and right" accuse the Pope of lying.  
**11. Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Attributes complex abuse cover-ups solely to the Pope’s personal deceit (e.g., "Bergoglio wanted Barros as a bishop and that was that").  
**12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is direct in accusations; no deliberate vagueness is used to confuse.  
**13. Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Cites Cardinal O’Malley, Marie Collins, and journalists (e.g., Winfield/AP) to validate claims against the Pope.  
**14. Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents the Pope as either lying or Cardinal O’Malley not delivering the letter, ignoring nuance (e.g., "there is really only one; that the pope lied").  
**15. Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses phrases like "that was that" and "We cool and hip people don’t hate gays, do we?" to shut down critical analysis.  
**16. Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: Diverts to the Grassi case in Argentina to distract from the Chile scandal (e.g., detailing Grassi’s history despite its irrelevance to Barros).  
**17. Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The Pope’s actual statements (e.g., "no evidence") are directly quoted and rebutted, not misrepresented.  
**18. Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy against critics; focus remains on the Pope’s actions.

### Verdict – 90% – Explanation  
The text is **highly propagandistic** due to:  
1. **Systematic Use of Techniques**: It employs 14/18 listed techniques (e.g., name-calling, repetition, fear appeals) to vilify Pope Francis, portraying him as a deceitful manipulator.  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language, exaggerated claims, and fear-based warnings (e.g., "destruction of trust," "societal disintegration") prioritize persuasion over balanced analysis.  
3. **Selective Evidence**: Cherry-picks incidents (e.g., the Barros and Ricca cases) while dismissing counter-evidence (e.g., the Pope’s apologies, Vatican investigations).  
4. **Narrative Over Objectivity**: The tone is accusatory and hyperbolic, framing the Pope’s actions as part of a deliberate pattern of lying ("virtuoso performance-liar"), rather than exploring complexities.  
5. **Ideological Agenda**: Aims to undermine the Pope’s credibility using secular and conservative Catholic sources, aligning with critics of his leadership (e.g., citing *The Dictator Pope*).  

**Why not 100%?**  
- The text cites verifiable facts (e.g., AP reports, victim letters), preventing it from being purely fictional propaganda.  
- However, these facts are weaponized through manipulative techniques, making it overwhelmingly propagandistic in intent and execution.
