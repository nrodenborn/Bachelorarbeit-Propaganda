1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents "Never-Trumpers" and refers to the Democratic party as the "Party of Pelosi", both of which are insulting labels used to attack and dismiss political groups.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the core message that the old Republican party is gone multiple times in quick succession: "is history," "It’s not coming back," "no restoration is in the cards," "It is over," and "There will be no turning back."
3. Slogans – No – The text does not employ its own brief, memorable phrases intended for widespread use, though it does reference a slogan used by others ("Trump's wall").
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by describing a "second Cold War," a "humanitarian crisis," a "bleeding southern border," and the rise of a "potentially malevolent power" (China) as consequences of past policies.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text explicitly questions the credibility of past Republican leaders with the rhetorical question: "Why are the people responsible for these wars still being listened to, rather than confessing their sins at second-thoughts conferences?"
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by comparing the "blindness" of American elites to that of "declining and falling empires" like Rome, which is a dramatic overstatement.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to national identity and patriotism by framing the argument around controlling "our bleeding southern border" and fulfilling the "desperate desire of peoples everywhere to preserve who and what they are."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "hubristic drive," "historic blunders," and "bleeding southern border" to evoke an emotional response from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons, direct or indirect, to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that nationalism is a rising global tide, listing numerous world leaders like Putin, Xi, and Modi, implying that Trump's rise is part of an inevitable and popular worldwide trend.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents the rise of China as a "geo-strategic rival" as a simple result of the U.S. opening its markets, ignoring many other complex economic and political factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's arguments, while fallacious, are presented directly and clearly, not with intentional vagueness.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites "statesmen like George Kennan" to lend credibility to its argument against NATO expansion and the containment of Russia.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two choices for conservatives: align with Trump or be part of the failed old guard that is "crying out for the Party of Pelosi to save us," ignoring any other possible conservative positions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "It is over" is used as a blunt, final declaration to shut down any debate or critical thought about the future of the Republican party.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a quote from Bono about international institutions to distract from the main topic of internal Republican party politics and pivot to an attack on globalism.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the imagined argument that Never-Trumpers oppose conservative policies like tax cuts and conservative judges, when their primary criticisms are often focused on character and democratic norms, not policy.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges the Republican establishment with hypocrisy by stating they are now "Talking of building a Reagan-like Navy to contain the mammoth they nourished" (referring to China).

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 15 of the 18 listed propaganda techniques, often using multiple techniques within the same sentence. The piece is not a balanced analysis but a polemic designed to persuade the reader by using emotional manipulation (Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear), logical fallacies (Causal Oversimplification, Black & White Fallacy, Straw Men), and rhetorical devices that shut down dissent (Repetition, Thought-Terminating Clichés). The author systematically attacks an out-group ("Never-Trumpers," "elites") while promoting an in-group (Trump supporters, "GOP grass roots") and presents a highly simplified, emotionally charged version of complex political history to argue that there is only one acceptable path forward.
