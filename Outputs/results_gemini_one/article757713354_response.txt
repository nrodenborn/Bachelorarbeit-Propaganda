1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack its subjects, such as "Big Brother USA," "junior sidekick South Korea," "neocon minions," "loud-mouthed neocon Nikki Haley," and "bootlickers."
2. Repetition – No – While a central theme is present, the text does not repeat the same specific words or phrases over and over again in the manner of the example.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable, and chant-like phrases to encapsulate an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting North Korea could suffer the same fate as Libya if it cooperates with the US: "The hapless Libyan leader was eventually murdered by French agents. Is this what Bolton has in mind for North Korea?"
5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively casts doubt on the motives of US officials: "Some wondered if Bolton and perhaps Pompeo were trying to sabotage the North Korea deal. Or were at least being incredibly obtuse and belligerent. Was Trump involved in this intrigue?"
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author uses hyperbole to describe US policy towards Iran, calling it a policy of "'eat sand and die,'" which is an exaggeration of the actual demands.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to American patriotism; on the contrary, it is highly critical of US foreign policy.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to influence the reader's perception, such as "wicked plan," "prickly North Koreans," "furious North Koreans," and "hapless Libyan leader."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is good because it is popular; instead, it presents a contrarian viewpoint.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies a complex geopolitical situation by blaming the potential failure of peace talks almost entirely on a single cause: "North Korea was right on target when it accused arch-neocon John Bolton of trying to sabotage the peace deal."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's viewpoint and accusations are very direct and clear, not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author makes a self-appeal to authority to add weight to their claims: "Veteran Korea observers, this writer included, find it hard to believe Kim Jong-un will give up his nuclear weapons".
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text opens by presenting only two extreme possibilities for the US's actions: "It’s got to be either one of the stupidest acts that I can recall or a very wicked plan by Washington neocons".
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down debate; it makes a series of arguments intended to persuade.
16. Red herring – No – The topics introduced (Iran, Libya, Israel) are used as evidence to support the central argument about US untrustworthiness, not as distractions from it.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes a caricature of the US position by saying "As Trump administration mouthpieces were gabbing about peace and light," which is a simplistic portrayal created to be easily attacked.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects from the issue of North Korea's denuclearization by charging the US with hypocrisy: "Speaking of de-nuclearization, why does North Korea not demand that the US get rid of its nuclear weapons based in South Korea, Okinawa, Guam and with the 7th Fleet?"

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a very high number of propaganda techniques (10 out of the 18 listed) to construct a one-sided and emotionally manipulative argument. The author's goal is not to provide a balanced analysis of the complex geopolitical situation but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly critical view of the United States and its officials, particularly the "neocons."

The piece relies heavily on loaded language ("wicked plan," "neocon minions") and name-calling ("Big Brother USA") to create an immediate negative emotional response. It uses logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy ("stupidest act or a very wicked plan") and causal oversimplification (blaming John Bolton) to frame the situation in a simplistic, biased way. Furthermore, it uses appeal to fear by invoking the murder of Muammar Kadaffi as a potential outcome for North Korea's leader and whataboutism to deflect criticism of North Korea by pointing to US nuclear weapons. The combination of these techniques creates a powerful piece of persuasive writing that prioritizes a specific agenda over objective reporting, which is the essence of propaganda.
