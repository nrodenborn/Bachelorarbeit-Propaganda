1. Name calling – No – The text accuses authorities of lying and a cover-up, but it does not use simple insulting labels to attack them.

2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that there was a cover-up and that the official story is false is repeated throughout the text. For example, it states the report "contradicts the official story," that authorities "have so far done everything in their power to cover-up," that the information has been "hidden from the American people," and that the "official narrative... [is] be completely destroyed."

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in a slogan-like manner.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear by suggesting that the official account of a major tragedy is a lie and that powerful authorities are hiding a greater, unknown threat from the public. The idea of "multiple active shooters" and a government "cover-up" is meant to create anxiety and fear.

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire purpose of the text is to cast doubt on the credibility of the "official story," the police, and the FBI. For example: "In yet another astonishing eyewitness report that contradicts the official story..." and "At this point it is strikingly obvious that authorities have lied to the American people..."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to strengthen its claims. For example: "...the official narrative regarding the Las Vegas Massacre be completely destroyed" and "...it is strikingly obvious that authorities have lied..." These phrases present the author's conclusion as an absolute and undeniable fact, which is an exaggeration of the evidence presented.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of national identity by framing the alleged deception as a betrayal of the American public. For example: "...information that the police and the FBI has hidden from the American people" and "...authorities have lied to the American people about the worst mass shooting in our countries history."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's perception. Examples include "astonishing eyewitness report," "confessional," "cover-up," and "strikingly obvious," which are all intended to evoke suspicion and outrage.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not associate the official story or the authorities with any groups widely hated by the audience, such as Nazis.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that a growing number of people are realizing the "truth," encouraging the reader to join them. For example: "Slowly but surely we are starting to see the official narrative... be completely destroyed" implies a growing movement that the reader should be a part of.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex situation. It asserts that any discrepancy between eyewitness accounts and the official report is due to a single, simple cause: a deliberate and malicious "cover-up" by authorities, ignoring other potential explanations like the chaos of the event, misinterpretation of sounds, or unrelated incidents.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague; it makes very specific accusations (a shooter at the Bellagio at 11:20 pm) to appear more credible.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – While it attacks official authorities (police, FBI), it establishes its own set of alternative authorities to appear credible. These include the "eyewitness" Jeff, another witness Rene Downs, and the journalist Shepard Ambellas, whose support is used as evidence.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either the official story is 100% correct, or there was a massive conspiracy and cover-up as described. It ignores other possibilities, such as the eyewitness being mistaken or confused in a chaotic moment.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that present a conclusion as final and discourage further questioning. For example: "There is no mistake in my mind about it" and "At this point it is strikingly obvious that authorities have lied..." These statements are meant to end debate rather than encourage it.

16. Red herring – No – The text remains focused on its central claim about a second shooter and a cover-up and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the reader.

17. Straw men – No – The text attacks the actual official narrative (a lone gunman) rather than misrepresenting it and attacking a weaker, fabricated version of the argument.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing the authorities of hypocrisy on an unrelated issue.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear example of propaganda, specifically in the style of a conspiracy theory piece. Its primary purpose is not to report facts objectively but to persuade the reader to distrust official sources and accept a specific alternative narrative. This is achieved through a high density of propaganda techniques. The text builds its entire argument on casting **Doubt** on the "official story" while using **Appeal to (alternative) Authority** by presenting "eyewitnesses" as the sole bearers of truth. It employs a **Black & White Fallacy**, forcing a choice between the official story and a malicious cover-up, ignoring any other explanation. The argument is saturated with **Loaded Language** ("cover-up," "astonishing") and **Exaggeration** ("completely destroyed," "strikingly obvious") to create an emotional and sensationalist tone. It uses **Appeal to Fear** by suggesting a hidden, ongoing threat that authorities are concealing, and **Flag-Waving** to frame this as a betrayal of the "American people." The combination of these techniques demonstrates a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's perception and emotions to promote a specific, unsubstantiated agenda rather than engage in factual, evidence-based reporting.
