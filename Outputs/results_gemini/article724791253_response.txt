1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the council’s action as a “ridiculous exercise in virtue-signaling,” refers to certain individuals as “jihad preachers,” and quotes the council calling President Trump a “bigot”.

2. Repetition – Yes – The central theme of the UK's hypocrisy—banning individuals like Trump or the author while admitting “jihad preachers”—is repeated throughout the text with multiple examples.

3. Slogans – No – The text uses strong phrasing but does not employ brief, memorable slogans designed for mass repetition.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text seeks to instill fear by detailing the violent rhetoric of individuals allegedly admitted into the UK, such as Shaykh Hamza Sodagar’s list of punishments for homosexuals, including to “chop their head off” or “burn them to death.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the credibility of the Tower Hamlets council by stating it “has been at the centre of serious corruption scandals, including the removal of an Islamist mayor who was found guilty of bribing Muslim groups”.

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author minimizes the reason for his own ban from the UK as simply “telling the truth about Islam and jihad,” while exaggerating the significance of a single, unenforceable borough council vote to represent a national hypocrisy.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of national identity and values by framing the issue as “Britain’s hypocrisy” and highlighting perceived betrayals of these values, such as the Archbishop of Canterbury welcoming a controversial preacher.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words, such as “ridiculous exercise in virtue-signaling,” “jihad preachers,” “preaching of hatred and jihad violence,” and “relentlessly appeasement-minded government.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text quotes a Conservative councillor who brings up a past tweet from a candidate in the borough that said, “let us support Hitler the Great,” to discredit the current council's actions.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is good because it is popular. Instead, it criticizes the council for what it implies is jumping on a bandwagon by noting a neighbouring borough passed a similar motion.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the UK's complex immigration decisions by attributing them to a single cause: a “relentlessly appeasement-minded government” and hypocrisy, ignoring other potential legal or security considerations.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and makes clear, specific accusations. It does not use vague or obscure expressions to confuse the audience.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text presents itself as an authoritative account by “Robert Spencer” and quotes Peter Golds, “the leader of the Conservatives group in the council,” as an authority to lend credibility to its criticism of the council.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text creates a false dichotomy between banning people like the author (who claims to be “telling the truth about Islam and jihad”) and welcoming “jihad preachers,” presenting these as the only two outcomes of UK policy.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like “ridiculous exercise in virtue-signaling” and the self-characterization of being banned for “telling the truth about Islam and jihad” are used to dismiss the opposition's motives and actions without engaging in a nuanced discussion.

16. Red herring – Yes – To distract from the council's stated reasons for its anti-Trump motion, the author introduces the separate issues of his own travel ban, the admission of various preachers, and past corruption scandals involving a previous mayor.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text does not engage with the council's actual arguments against Trump (e.g., his “bigoted attitude towards women, ethnic minorities and Muslims”). Instead, it attacks a straw man: the idea that the council is a morally consistent entity, by focusing on hypocrisy and corruption.

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The entire article is a classic example of whataboutism. In response to the council's criticism of Trump, the author's primary argument is to deflect by saying, “What about the jihad preachers Britain admits?” and “What about the fact that Pamela Geller and I are banned?”

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its entire structure is built upon a foundation of whataboutism, designed not to engage with the substance of the Tower Hamlets council's motion against Donald Trump, but to deflect from it by charging the UK with hypocrisy. It systematically employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal.

The piece heavily relies on emotional manipulation through Loaded Language ("jihad preachers," "virtue-signaling") and Appeal to Fear (graphic descriptions of advocated violence). It actively works to discredit the source of the anti-Trump motion by casting Doubt (highlighting "serious corruption scandals") and using Reduction ad Hitlerum (linking a past political candidate in the borough to Hitler).

Furthermore, it constructs a simplistic and false narrative using the Black & White Fallacy, pitting "truth-tellers" like the author against a "relentlessly appeasement-minded government" that welcomes violent extremists. This Causal Oversimplification ignores the complexities of immigration law and national security. The author uses Red Herrings (his own travel ban, the case of Christian bishops) to distract from the council's specific arguments, instead attacking a Straw Man of the council's moral authority rather than the content of their motion.

The overwhelming and deliberate use of these techniques indicates that the text's primary purpose is not to inform or persuade through reasoned argument, but to reinforce a specific worldview, provoke an emotional response, and delegitimize any opposition. This is the hallmark of propaganda.
