Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Comey’s actions as "undisciplined behavior" and says he decided to "go rogue."
2.  Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly pushes the idea that the IG report was insufficient and a "whitewash," using phrases like "A Slap On The Wrist," "disappointingly watered-down form," and "as disappointing as the rigged outcome of the e-mail investigation itself."
3.  Slogans – Yes – The text uses the memorable phrase "Get Out of Jail Free card" to describe the outcome for Hillary Clinton.
4.  Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses on generating anger and distrust about past events rather than instilling fear of a future alternative.
5.  Doubt – Yes – The entire piece is designed to cast doubt on the credibility of the Inspector General's report, stating, "it is clear that either Mr. Horowitz himself decided to pull his punches or that the final version... emerged in a disappointingly watered-down form."
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the 500-page report's findings as a "slap on the wrist" and "the equivalent of a departmental employee review," while exaggerating the supposed conspiracy by calling the investigation's outcome "rigged."
7.  Flag-Waving – No – The text does not use appeals to patriotism or national identity to make its case.
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as "infamous tarmac meeting," "salacious and unverified 'dossier'," "complete dereliction of duty," and "treat Hillary Clinton with kid gloves."
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or other widely hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text argues against the official conclusion of the report and does not claim its own position is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex outcome of the investigation to a single, simple cause, stating, "The fix was in as early as May 2016," ignoring the numerous procedural and legal factors involved.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text itself is not vague; it is very direct in its accusations. It accuses others of this technique but does not use it.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text does the opposite; it actively works to discredit the authority of the Inspector General and his report rather than using it for support.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as having only two possibilities: "it is clear that either Mr. Horowitz himself decided to pull his punches or that the final version... emerged in a disappointingly watered-down form," ignoring any other potential explanations for the report's conclusions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase, "This conclusion defies common sense," to dismiss the report's findings without substantive argument, encouraging readers to reject it based on a gut feeling.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text brings up the Steele "dossier" and the Carter Page FISA warrant, only to state they are being investigated separately. This serves to introduce unrelated, controversial topics to cast general suspicion on the FBI and DOJ.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text attacks the IG report for not finding that bias affected the ultimate outcome, even though it quotes the report's original mandate which stated it "will not substitute the OIG's judgment for the judgments made by the FBI or the Department regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions." It criticizes the report for failing to do something it never set out to do.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text maintains a singular focus on its targets and does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. It is not a balanced or objective analysis of the Inspector General's report. Instead, it is a one-sided polemic that selectively uses facts, quotes, and a multitude of propaganda techniques to advance a specific narrative: that the FBI and DOJ are corrupt, that Hillary Clinton was given a pass due to a "rigged" system, and that the official IG report is a "whitewash" of this corruption.

The author employs loaded language ("infamous," "dereliction of duty"), name-calling ("undisciplined," "go rogue"), and slogans ("Get Out of Jail Free card") to create a strong emotional bias against the subjects. It uses causal oversimplification ("The fix was in") and thought-terminating clichés ("defies common sense") to shut down critical thinking and present a complex situation in stark, simple terms. Furthermore, it builds a straw man by attacking the report for failing to achieve an outcome it never set out to accomplish. The entire piece is an exercise in casting doubt on official institutions and their findings, which is a primary goal of many propaganda efforts. While it contains factual elements (names, dates, direct quotes), they are framed in a way that exclusively supports a pre-determined conclusion, making it a clear piece of persuasive propaganda rather than objective commentary.
