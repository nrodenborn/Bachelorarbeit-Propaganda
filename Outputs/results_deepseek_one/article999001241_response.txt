Based on the provided definitions and analysis of the text, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – No  
   *(No insulting labels directly applied to the caravan or migrants. "Illegally" is descriptive in context.)*  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation: The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated verbatim three times.*  
3. **Slogans** – No  
   *(No brief, memorable phrases like "Build the Wall" used.)*  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No  
   *(Mentions border reinforcements but does not instil fear against alternatives.)*  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation: Casts doubt on elections with "voter fraud and election meddling and manipulation" (no evidence provided).*  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No  
   *(No clear exaggeration/minimization; "thousands of migrants" is plausible.)*  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation: Uses "our country" and "enter our country illegally" to invoke national identity.*  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes**  
   *Explanation: "Enter our country illegally", "barbed wires", "undeterred" imply threat and defiance.*  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No  
   *(No Nazi/Vichy comparisons.)*  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation: Poll implies reader alignment ("Yes, he should have...") to pressure agreement.*  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No  
    *(No oversimplified cause-effect claims.)*  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation: "Election meddling and manipulation" is vague and unspecific.*  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation: Cites RT (Russian state media) and Trump uncritically as sources.*  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation: Poll offers binary choices ("Yes" or "No") with loaded options (e.g., "act like a child").*  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No  
    *(No phrases like "it is what it is" to end discussion.)*  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes**  
    *Explanation: The Jim Acosta poll distracts from the caravan story (irrelevant to migrants/border).*  
17. **Straw men** – No  
    *(No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.)*  
18. **Whataboutism** – No  
    *(No accusations of hypocrisy.)*  

---

**Verdict – 85%**  
The text exhibits **multiple propaganda techniques** (repetition, doubt, loaded language, flag-waving, bandwagon, obfuscation, appeal to authority, black/white fallacy, red herring). It frames migrants negatively through language ("illegally", "undeterred"), distracts with an unrelated poll, and amplifies unverified claims (election fraud). While it reports factual elements (caravan movement, Trump’s policy), the selective framing, emotional language, and diversionary tactics align with propaganda objectives. The 85% likelihood reflects strong propagandistic intent but acknowledges minor factual content. Sources like RT (Kremlin-linked) and embedded partisan polls further undermine neutrality.
