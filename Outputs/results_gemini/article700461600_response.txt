1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels a group as "the neocons" and refers to a newspaper as "The interventionist Post," which are labels used to attack their respective positions.
2. Repetition – No – The text builds a singular argument but does not repeat the same message or phrase over and over.
3. Slogans – No – The text uses memorable phrases like "Trump is being led to the Rubicon," but these are literary metaphors rather than repeatable slogans designed for mass appeal.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by highlighting the potential negative outcomes of intervention, such as, "After 4,500 U.S. dead, scores of thousands wounded and a trillion dollars sunk, our 15-year war in Iraq could end with a Shiite-dominated Baghdad aligned with Tehran."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the wisdom and success of U.S. policy and the motives of others, for example, "is that really a victory?" and "Who then enforces Tillerson's demands?"
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to emphasize a point, such as stating the Kurdish "dream of independence is all but dead."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue around American interests and costs, using phrases like "More troubling for America," "our 15-year war," and questioning if "the American people support such a war."
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as "grim prospect," "strategic disaster," and "rout of the peshmerga."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text argues against what it portrays as the prevailing interventionist view in Washington, rather than suggesting its own view is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text largely avoids oversimplification, instead highlighting the complex and often contradictory outcomes of U.S. foreign policy actions.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's argument and point of view are presented clearly and directly, not obscured with vague language.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text concludes by listing the author's (Patrick J. Buchanan's) books, which serves as a self-referential appeal to his own authority on the subject.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents limited, stark choices, such as, "Do we accept that outcome, pack up and go home? Or do we leave our forces in Syria and Iraq...?" and frames the Washington Post's argument as, "Confront Assad and Iran now, or fight them later."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text uses rhetorical questions to encourage thought about its specific viewpoint, not to shut down discussion with clichés.
16. Red herring – No – All the examples and topics discussed are relevant to the central argument about U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author refutes a simplified version of his opponent's argument by summarizing The Washington Post's editorial as "The interventionist Post is saying: The situation is intolerable. Confront Assad and Iran now, or fight them later," which may not represent the full nuance of the original argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text critiques U.S. policy and its consequences but does not deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 85% – The text is a sophisticated piece of propaganda in the form of a persuasive opinion column. It is not a neutral analysis of events but an argument constructed to lead the reader to a specific, non-interventionist conclusion. It heavily employs numerous propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. The author uses powerful emotional appeals, including Appeal to Fear (the cost of war in American lives and treasure) and Loaded Language ("grim prospect," "strategic disaster"), to create a negative sentiment towards U.S. intervention. The argument is framed using logical fallacies like the Black & White Fallacy, which presents the complex situation as a simple choice between another disastrous war and withdrawal. It uses Name-Calling ("neocons," "interventionist Post") and creates a Straw Man of opposing arguments to discredit them more easily. While it uses factual events as its basis, the selection, framing, and interpretation of these events are all guided by a clear political agenda, making it a strong example of propaganda.
