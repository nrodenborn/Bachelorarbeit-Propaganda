1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Christine Ford a “far-left Democrat operative.”
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat the same message over and over.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief and memorable phrases as a primary tool of persuasion.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests the Democrats have “nefarious goals of stopping the President from strengthening America and protecting Americans,” implying a negative future if they succeed.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the credibility of the accuser and her story, for example, by calling it an “unprovable accusation” and stating her “memory of the event may be suspect.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the Democrats' motives by calling their goals “nefarious” and minimizes the accusation by calling it “unprovable.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism with the phrase “strengthening America and protecting Americans.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like “nefarious goals” and “far-left Democrat operative.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with groups hated by the audience, such as Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for the accusation by stating, “This is clearly a set-up... designed to derail the nomination of a good man.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its arguments and does not use deliberately unclear expressions.
13. Appeal to authority – No – While the text quotes an author from the National Review, it presents his argument rather than using his authority alone as evidence.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The introductory text presents a binary choice: the accusation is either a nefarious political “set-up” by Democrats or it is legitimate, with the text strongly implying only the former is true.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases designed to discourage critical thought. It mentions “boys will be boys” only to refute it.
16. Red herring – Yes – The title and first sentence introduce accusations against Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken, and George Soros to distract from the central issue of the Kavanaugh allegation.
17. Straw men – Yes – The title creates a straw man by claiming “Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women,” an oversimplified and absolute position that is easy to attack by pointing out exceptions.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The entire premise of the title and opening sentence is to charge Democrats with hypocrisy by asking “what about” other accused Democrats, deflecting from the accusation against Kavanaugh.

Verdict – 85% – The text is a composite piece, and its propagandistic nature comes from how its parts are assembled. The first section (before the David French quote) is overtly and intensely propagandistic. It uses a high concentration of techniques, including Whataboutism, Straw Men, Red Herring, Name Calling, Loaded Language, Causal Oversimplification, and Appeal to Fear to frame the issue in a highly partisan and emotionally manipulative way.

The second, longer section is an excerpt of political commentary that is more analytical in tone. While it argues for a specific viewpoint (that the evidence against Kavanaugh is weak), it does so by weighing evidence and acknowledging the seriousness of the charge, even explicitly rejecting a thought-terminating cliché (“boys will be boys”). This section, on its own, is better classified as opinion journalism than pure propaganda.

However, the text as a whole is presented as a single article. The aggressive, propagandistic introduction acts as a frame, telling the reader how to interpret the more reasoned analysis that follows. By front-loading the piece with accusations of a "set-up" by "nefarious" political "operatives," the author primes the reader to view the subsequent analysis not as an objective weighing of facts, but as confirmation of the initial, politically-charged conclusion. This combination of emotional manipulation with selective analysis makes the overall text a highly effective piece of propaganda.
