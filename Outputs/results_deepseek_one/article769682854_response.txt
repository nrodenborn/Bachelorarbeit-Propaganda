### Verdict – 15% – Explanation:  
The text **reports an incident** involving a political symbol (MAGA hat) but **avoids overt propaganda**. Key points:  
- **Neutral framing**: The assault is described factually, quoting participants (victim, assailant, bar, police) without editorializing.  
- **Minimal technique use**: Only *Name Calling* and *Loaded Language* appear, both **attributed to the assailant or third parties** (e.g., Facebook’s "scum bag" label). The article itself does not employ these techniques persuasively.  
- **Balanced perspective**: Includes the victim’s call for dialogue ("let’s have a conversation"), Whataburger’s condemnation, and the bar’s emphasis on inclusivity.  
- **Context**: While the MAGA hat is politically charged, the text focuses on the crime and its consequences, not endorsing/slandering a group.  
**Propaganda likelihood is low (15%)** as the primary aim is informational reporting, not manipulation. The slight score reflects quoted inflammatory language, not the article’s intent.
