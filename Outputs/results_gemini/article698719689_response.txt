3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – No – While the subject matter is frightening, the text reports facts about a dangerous situation rather than instilling fear to support an idea against an alternative. The fear is inherent to the topic, not a manufactured tool of persuasion.
5. Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or organization; instead, it cites credible sources to support its claims.

7. Flag-Waving – No – There is no appeal to patriotism or national identity in the text.
8. Loaded Language – No – The text uses medically and historically accurate terms ("plague," "fatal," "black death"). The emotional weight of these words comes from their factual meaning, not from a manipulative intent.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to hated groups.

Verdict – 5% – The text is overwhelmingly informational and functions as a standard news report on a public health crisis. Its primary goal is to inform the reader by presenting verifiable facts, statistics, and data from credible, named sources. The only propaganda technique identified, "Appeal to authority," is used in a standard and appropriate journalistic manner to establish the credibility of the information, not as a logical fallacy to push a hidden agenda. The text lacks the manipulative intent, emotional skewing, logical fallacies, and biased perspective that are characteristic of propaganda. The tone is serious and factual, and any fear or concern it generates is a direct result of the real-world situation being described, not of manipulative rhetoric.
