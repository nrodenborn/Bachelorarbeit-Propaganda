Certainly! Here is the analysis of the text according to each propaganda technique:

---

1. **Name calling** – Yes – The text uses insulting labels such as "pathological liar," "accused woman abuser," "flea-infested political con man," and compares Ellison to a "flea" and a "dog."
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?" is repeated multiple times.
3. **Slogans** – No – There is no use of a brief and memorable phrase as a rallying slogan.
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The mention of Farrakhan calling on "10,000 blacks to stalk and murder white people" and references to Communists and Islamists supporting Ellison are designed to instill fear.
5. **Doubt** – Yes – The text questions Ellison’s credibility, e.g., "Keith, you're lying," "seeks to deceive you," and "Yeah, right, Hakim!"
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – The text exaggerates Ellison’s connections and intentions, e.g., "pathological liar," "totalitarian-minded individual," and "seeks to deceive you."
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – There is no direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like "pathological liar," "devil as their father," "flea-infested," "totalitarian-minded," and "political con man" are emotionally charged.
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There is no direct comparison to Nazis or other universally hated groups, though there is some guilt by association.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no direct appeal to popularity or "everyone thinks this."
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – The text implies that Ellison’s association with Farrakhan directly defines his character and intentions, oversimplifying complex relationships.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – Phrases like "supported by Communists and Islamists alike" are vague and not substantiated.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text cites Michael Ahrens of GOP.com as an authority to support its claims.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The text presents Ellison as either completely honest or a complete liar, with no middle ground.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – The phrase "As the old saying goes, 'If you lie down with dogs, you're going to get fleas,'" is used to shut down further discussion.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The mention of Obama and Jeremiah Wright is an irrelevant distraction from the main topic of Ellison.
17. **Straw men** – Yes – The text misrepresents Ellison’s statements and intentions, e.g., "Ellison is attempting to do that same [as Obama]," which oversimplifies and distorts his position.
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – The text brings up Obama and his pastor to deflect from Ellison’s situation.

**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a wide array of propaganda techniques, including name calling, loaded language, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, and more. The text is designed to discredit and demonize Keith Ellison through emotional manipulation, character attacks, and guilt by association, rather than through balanced argument or factual reporting. The use of repetition, thought-terminating clichés, and red herrings further indicate a strong intent to persuade through propaganda rather than inform objectively. Only a few techniques (like slogans, flag-waving, reduction ad Hitlerum, and bandwagon) are not present, but the sheer number and intensity of the techniques used make it almost certainly propaganda.
