Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text attacks opponents with insulting labels, such as calling the government the "federal beast" and gun control advocates "gun grabbing Communists".
2.  Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times in a row.
3.  Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as slogans to rally support.
4.  Appeal to fear – No – The text celebrates its own position rather than instilling fear of an alternative to persuade the audience. It presents outcomes like "a deadly weapon at home with no government oversight" as a victory, not a threat.
5.  Doubt – Yes – The text questions the effectiveness of another pro-gun entity to elevate its subject, asking, "What has the NRA done for you lately?"
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the impact of the legal settlement with the claim: "Wilson boasted that his efforts have officially killed gun control."
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by describing the event as a "huge milestone in the history of our county, and as such, it should be celebrated as a victory."
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the audience, such as "intimidation tactics," "devastating blow," and "unlawful acts of fun gun confiscation."
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis to discredit an idea.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that the idea is good because it is popular; it frames it as a victory for an individual against a large entity.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple cause for a complex issue: "what this does is demonstrates that the genie is out of the bottle and there is just no way for gun grabbing Communists the world over to be able to truly enforce their unlawful acts of fun gun confiscation."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and clear about its position and is not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses a press release and a quote from an authority figure to support its claims: "“Not only is this a First Amendment victory for free speech, it also is a devastating blow to the gun prohibition lobby,” noted SAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb."
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a simple conflict between two sides, contrasting the "intimidation tactics" of the "Obama Justice Department" with the settlement from the "Trump DOJ."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down debate; it actively presents a one-sided argument.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a completely irrelevant topic to distract the reader: "take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?"
17. Straw men – No – The text attacks its opponents directly but does not misrepresent a specific counter-argument simply to refute it.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes the NRA but not as a way to deflect from a charge of hypocrisy against its main subject.

***

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to objectively inform the reader about a legal settlement but to persuade them to adopt a strong pro-gun, anti-regulation viewpoint. This is achieved through the heavy use of numerous propaganda techniques, including **Name Calling** ("federal beast," "gun grabbing Communists") to demonize opponents, **Loaded Language** ("intimidation tactics") to create an emotional response, **Flag-Waving** to tie the issue to national pride, and **Exaggeration** ("officially killed gun control") to inflate the victory's importance. The article presents a stark **Black & White Fallacy** of freedom versus oppression and uses a blatant **Red Herring** (the Kavanaugh poll) to distract the reader. The selective use of sources, the celebratory tone, and the clear ideological bias confirm its nature as propaganda rather than journalism.
