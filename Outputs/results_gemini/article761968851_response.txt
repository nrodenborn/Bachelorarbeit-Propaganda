Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the previous administration as the “Obama Regime,” which is a derogatory label implying an authoritarian and illegitimate government.
2.  Repetition – Yes – The phrase “Trump Effect” is repeated to reinforce the central message that the described economic changes are a direct result of the Trump administration.
3.  Slogans – Yes – The text uses “TRUMP EFFECT!” in the title and “ADVANTAGE AMERICANS” to punctuate statistical comparisons, creating memorable, impactful phrases.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear around the alternative (pro-immigration policies) by repeatedly using the concept of “American Worker Displacement” and warning that progress could be undone by a “DACA capitulation.”
5.  Doubt – Yes – The text begins by telling the reader to “Forget the Wolff book brouhaha,” directly attempting to cast doubt on the importance and relevance of other news stories critical of the administration.
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses words like “whopping” to describe job gains and makes the exaggerated claim that “Trump may have done more for blacks in 11 months than Obama did in eight years” based on limited data.
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text constantly frames the issue as a competition between “Native-born American workers” and immigrants, using phrases like “ADVANTAGE AMERICANS” to appeal to a sense of patriotism and national identity.
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and biased language such as “Obama Regime,” “unreported illegal alien surge,” and “American worker displacement” to evoke negative emotions towards the previous administration and immigration.
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with hated groups like Nazis to discredit it.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular; rather, it presents itself as revealing a hidden truth (“the real story is outside the Beltway”).
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The article posits a simple cause-and-effect relationship: Trump’s policies led to fewer immigrants, which directly caused lower unemployment for native-born Americans (“By removing foreign competitors, Trump may have done more for blacks in 11 months than Obama did in eight years”). This ignores the complexity of economic factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text introduces its own metric, the “New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index (NVDAWDI),” which is an obscure term designed to sound technical and authoritative, potentially confusing the reader while lending an air of scientific credibility.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the “Labor Department,” the “Center for Immigration Studies,” and an article from “The Economist” to lend credibility to its arguments.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the economic situation as a zero-sum game where a gain for immigrants is a loss for native-born Americans, and vice-versa. It frames the choice as one between the successful “Trump Era” policies and the damaging “Obama Regime” policies.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “the real story is outside the Beltway, where real people live and work” is used to shut down discussion of other political issues (“the Wolff book brouhaha”) and dismiss them as irrelevant to “real people.”
16. Red herring – Yes – The opening sentence introduces the “Wolff book brouhaha” and “Trump’s latest DACA dalliance” as distractions, immediately diverting the reader’s attention from other contemporary issues to the article’s specific economic argument.
17. Straw men – No – The text focuses on building its own argument rather than misrepresenting and refuting a specific counter-argument that was not actually made by an opponent.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes the previous administration but does not use the technique of deflecting a specific criticism by accusing the critic of hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. It is not an objective analysis of economic data but rather a persuasive piece designed to promote a specific political narrative. The author employs a wide array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. The entire article is built upon a foundation of Causal Oversimplification, attributing complex economic trends to a single cause (the "Trump Effect" on immigration). This core argument is supported by Loaded Language ("Obama Regime," "displacement"), Flag-Waving ("ADVANTAGE AMERICANS"), and a Black & White Fallacy that pits native-born workers against immigrants in a zero-sum game. The piece uses techniques like Red Herring and Doubt to dismiss competing narratives from the outset. It then lends its biased argument a veneer of credibility by using an Appeal to Authority (citing official-sounding sources) and Obfuscation (creating its own technical-sounding index, "NVDAWDI"). The combination of emotional manipulation, framing, and logical fallacies, all in service of a political conclusion, moves it far from journalism or analysis and firmly into the realm of propaganda.
