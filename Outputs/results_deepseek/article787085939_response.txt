### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "killer cop" (referring to Amber Guyger), "homicidal cop", and "smear campaign" (labeling police actions as malicious).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley..." is repeated verbatim three times.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases are used to summarize the argument.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **No** – The text does not instill fear against alternatives; it critiques existing actions.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions the credibility of police: "why on earth would they execute a search warrant...?" and challenges Guyger’s account (e.g., door ajar claim).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Minimizes marijuana find: "tiny bit of weed," "less than half an ounce." Exaggerates police intent: "smear," "assassination attempt."  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No appeal to patriotism or group identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotional/biased terms: "murder," "insidiously planned," "reprehensible," "killer cop," "smear."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No association of ideas with hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – No oversimplified cause for the shooting (e.g., acknowledges multiple contradictions in the narrative).  
12. **Obfuscation** – **No** – The text is direct and clear, not vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Quotes attorneys/witnesses as sources, not uncritically as authoritative proof.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents police as purely malicious ("smear campaign") and Jean as purely innocent ("upstanding member of society"), ignoring nuance.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases used to shut down debate; instead, encourages critical analysis.  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Focus remains on police actions; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Addresses actual police claims (e.g., marijuana find, door ajar).  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Distracts from marijuana find by shifting focus to Amber Guyger’s warrants: "Why no warrants released for *her* home?"

### Verdict – 90% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda**. It employs multiple persuasive techniques to advance a biased narrative against the Dallas Police Department:  
- **Loaded language** and **name-calling** ("killer cop," "smear") frame police as villainous.  
- **Minimization** downplays the marijuana discovery, while **exaggeration** amplifies police misconduct.  
- **Doubt** and **black-and-white fallacy** oversimplify the incident, portraying Jean as flawless and police as universally corrupt.  
- **Whataboutism** deflects scrutiny from Jean (e.g., marijuana) to Guyger’s warrants.  
- **Repetition** of the poll question emphasizes an unrelated political agenda, distracting from the core issue.  

Though based on real events, the text’s language is emotionally manipulative, omits police perspectives, and selectively presents facts to condemn the department. Its goal is to provoke outrage rather than offer balanced analysis, aligning with propaganda’s function to influence perception. The 10% uncertainty arises from factual reporting of attorney statements and warrant details, but these are framed to serve the propagandistic narrative.
