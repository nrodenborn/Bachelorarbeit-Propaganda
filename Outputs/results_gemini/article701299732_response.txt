1. Name calling – No – The text uses the term “Black Death,” but this is a historical name for the plague, not an insulting label aimed at a person or group.
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea that the plague is spreading or could spread rapidly is repeated throughout the text. Examples include: “The “Black Death” Plague Could Spread Rapidly,” “the disease is spreading rapidly,” and “the spread of this infection into the surrounding regions more likely.”
3. Slogans – Yes – The headline “It’s Airborne” functions as a slogan. It is a brief, memorable, and alarming phrase designed to capture the reader's attention.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text is constructed to instill fear. Phrases like “The “Black Death”,” “deadly plague outbreak,” “some people will die within 24 hours,” and “the most deadly form of the disease” are used to frighten the reader about a potential pandemic.
5. Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or organization. In fact, it uses authorities to bolster its claims.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses the historical term “Black Death” to describe a modern outbreak, which exaggerates the situation by creating an association with the devastating medieval pandemic. The headline and overall tone exaggerate the immediate threat to a global audience.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity. The focus is on a global health crisis.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to create an effect. “Black Death” is a historically loaded term, and phrases like “deadly plague,” “alarming warnings,” and “crisis” are used to evoke strong emotional responses of fear and urgency.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – This technique is not used in the text.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text states that “nine countries are sounding warnings” and that the “World Health Organization (WHO) has now issued alarming warnings in nine countries too,” suggesting that because multiple nations and a major organization are concerned, the reader should be as well.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not oversimplify the cause of the event. It explains that the increased threat is due to the outbreak taking on its pneumonic, airborne form and the risk of international travel.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not intentionally vague. It aims to be clear and alarming, using specific details and expert quotes to make its point.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text heavily relies on this technique by quoting experts and organizations to validate its claims. Examples include citing “Dr. Ashok Chopra, a professor of microbiology and immunology,” “Christine South, head of IFRC’s… emergency operations,” and the “World Health Organization (WHO).”
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present a false dichotomy or limit the options to only two choices.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion.
16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on the topic of the plague outbreak and its potential spread. No irrelevant material is introduced.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an opposing argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – This technique is not used in the text.

Verdict – 80% – While the article is based on a real event and cites real experts, its primary goal is not to inform but to alarm. The text is a piece of propaganda because it systematically employs techniques to frame the information in the most frightening way possible, prioritizing emotional manipulation over sober, factual reporting. The heavy use of Appeal to Fear, Loaded Language (e.g., "Black Death," "deadly"), Exaggeration, and Slogans ("It's Airborne") are all intended to create a sense of panic. This emotional narrative is then given a veneer of credibility through the Appeal to Authority technique, using expert quotes to legitimize the fearful tone. A neutral public health report would present the facts with a more measured tone, whereas this text selectively presents information and uses specific wording to persuade the audience to feel fear and a sense of impending doom. The combination of factual elements with significant emotional manipulation makes it highly propagandistic.
