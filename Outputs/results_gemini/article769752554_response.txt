Name calling – Yes – The text quotes the mother, Patricia Spittler, calling the man who attacked her son a “scum bag of the year.”
Repetition – No – While the subject of the MAGA hat is mentioned multiple times, it is for descriptive context, not as a repetitive message intended to persuade.
Slogans – No – The slogan “Make America Great Again” is mentioned as the text on the hat, which is central to the news story, but the article itself does not use slogans to promote an idea.
Appeal to fear – No – The text reports on a violent incident, but it does not explicitly use fear of alternatives to support a particular idea.
Doubt – Yes – The text casts a slight doubt on the availability of the source material by stating the mother’s post “has since been taken down” and another post “had been removed or made private, meaning some may not see it.”
Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The article includes a tweet that exaggerates the significance of the event by claiming it represents “The civility of the Left on full display…”, using a single incident to characterize a large, diverse group.
Flag-Waving – Yes – The text quotes the mother describing the hat as “patriotic” and includes a tweet from an account, “The Columbia Bugle 🇺🇸”, which uses an American flag emoji to appeal to patriotism.
Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses phrases like “scum bag of the year,” “Disturbing video,” and includes the tweet’s sarcastic and stereotypical phrase “The civility of the Left on full display…” to evoke an emotional response.
Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with a group hated by the audience, such as Nazis.
Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is correct because it is popular or that the reader should join a majority.
Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The included tweet, “The civility of the Left on full display…”, simplifies the cause of one man’s violent actions to be a direct and sole representation of the political “Left.”
Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is generally direct in its reporting and does not use deliberately unclear expressions to confuse the audience.
Appeal to authority – No – While the text cites news sources and a police report, this is a standard journalistic practice of attribution, not a fallacious appeal to authority to prove a point.
Black & white fallacy – Yes – The framing of the incident, particularly through the included tweet, presents a stark contrast between the innocent teenager and “The civility of the Left,” creating a two-sided, good vs. evil narrative.
Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “The civility of the Left on full display…” is a sarcastic, cliché-like statement that discourages nuanced discussion by presenting a final, damning judgment.
Red herring – No – The text remains focused on the incident and its aftermath and does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the reader.
Straw men – Yes – The included tweet attacks a caricature of “the Left” as being uncivil and violent. This refutes a broad, unstated, and simplified version of an opponent rather than a specific, real argument.
Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy; it makes a direct accusation about the behavior of the man and, by extension, “the Left.”

Verdict – 85% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it reports on a real event that was corroborated by a police report, its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader toward a specific political viewpoint. The article achieves this by heavily framing the incident as a political statement. The most significant piece of evidence is the inclusion and highlighting of the tweet from "The Columbia Bugle." This tweet is a piece of pure propaganda, using exaggeration, causal oversimplification, a black & white fallacy, and a straw man argument to cast the actions of one individual as representative of an entire political ideology ("the Left"). The article also selectively uses loaded language (the mother's "scum bag" comment, her description of the hat as "patriotic") and flag-waving (the flag emoji in the tweet) to create a simple narrative of a patriotic hero-victim versus a depraved political enemy. A neutral news report would focus on the facts of the assault and the legal consequences, whereas this text centers the political commentary to provoke an emotional and partisan response.
