Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1. **Name calling – Yes** – "anti-American" (used repeatedly to describe the AMA), "stupid people" (referencing Congress members), "Socialist and Communist" (referencing Sara Berg/AMA).  
2. **Repetition – Yes** – "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" repeated three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans – No** – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans (e.g., "Non-American Medical Association" is sarcastic but not deployed as a rallying cry).  
4. **Appeal to fear – Yes** – "It's going to infringe on the rights of those who don't commit crimes and need a gun to protect themselves" (fear of defenselessness); "denying them their liberty" (fear of tyranny).  
5. **Doubt – Yes** – "The majority of people at the AMA probably couldn't tell you any of these devices or items if they saw them" (questions AMA's credibility on gun knowledge).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Exaggeration: "as anti-American as it comes"; Minimization: Dismissing gun violence as not an "epidemic" despite AMA calling it a "public health crisis."  
7. **Flag-Waving – Yes** – "anti-American," "constitutional militia," "God-given rights," "Second Amendment's protections" (appeals to patriotism/identity).  
8. **Loaded Language – Yes** – "government overreach," "unconstitutional legislation," "Socialist and Communist," "carnage of gun violence" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No comparison to Hitler/Nazis or hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon – No** – No emphasis on the popularity of the author’s stance.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – "Yeah, that's gonna keep people safe" (mocks age restrictions as a simple solution to mass shootings).  
12. **Obfuscation – No** – Arguments are direct, not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – No external authorities cited to support claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes** – "I'm all for situations like Nikolas Cruz... being arrested... but to go seizing people's property... is anti-constitutional" (frames gun control as only "due process" vs. "unconstitutional seizure").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – "plain and simple" (to dismiss AMA's motives), "God-given rights" (shuts down debate on gun regulations).  
16. **Red herring – Yes** – "people are dying by the hundreds of thousands at the hands of drugs approved by the FDA" (diverts to pharmaceuticals to avoid addressing gun violence arguments).  
17. **Straw men – Yes** – "They want to do what President Donald Trump suggested and 'take the guns first' and forget due process" (misrepresents AMA’s court-petition process as bypassing due process).  
18. **Whataboutism – Yes** – "Where is Berg's blog post on that? Where is the AMA statement against pharmaceutical companies?" (deflects criticism by accusing AMA of hypocrisy on other issues).  

---

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs **12 of the 18 techniques** analyzed, including heavy use of *name-calling*, *loaded language*, *flag-waving*, and *straw men* to vilify the AMA. Core strategies include:  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Fear-based appeals about lost liberties and distorted patriotism.  
- **Distortion of facts**: Misrepresenting AMA policies (e.g., due process bypass) and dismissing gun violence data.  
- **Diversion**: Red herrings (FDA/pharma) and whataboutism to avoid engaging with AMA’s public health arguments.  
- **Suppressing nuance**: Black-and-white framing and thought-terminating clichés shut down critical analysis.  
The text’s primary goal is not to debate policy but to delegitimize the AMA through aggressive rhetoric, partisan attacks (e.g., the "corrupt Democrat" poll), and ideological reinforcement for a specific audience. While it references real AMA policies, these are consistently twisted to fit a narrative of "anti-American" tyranny, aligning with classic propaganda objectives.
