Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the given text:

1.  **Name calling** – No. No insulting labels are used against any subject in the text.
2.  **Repetition** – No. While phrases like "nothing suspicious" and the nature of the ammunition sale are discussed multiple times, it is for factual reporting and context, not deliberate repetition of a core propaganda message.
3.  **Slogans** – No. No brief, memorable phrases are used to promote an idea.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No. The text reports on a tragic event, but it does not attempt to instill fear to support a specific idea or alternative.
5.  **Doubt** – No. The text does not question the credibility of any specific person, group, or idea. It reports statements (like Haig seeing "nothing wrong") without casting doubt on them.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No. The text reports facts (e.g., amount of ammo sold, Haig's status) and statements from sources (e.g., Victor defending the sale as legal, Spitzer calling large tracer sales unusual) without apparent exaggeration or minimization for persuasive effect.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No. There is no appeal to patriotism or identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No. The language is largely neutral and factual. Terms like "person of interest," "disturbed," "deadliest mass shooting" are descriptive rather than emotionally charged in a manipulative way within this context.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No. No ideas are disapproved by associating them with hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No. There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No. The text does not attribute the complex event (the shooting) to a single, simple cause. It focuses on one specific aspect (the ammo sale).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No. The text clarifies details (e.g., correcting the "person of interest" status, explaining the box found, noting different ammo amounts reported) rather than being intentionally vague. Statements like "unspecified ammunition" reflect initial reporting limitations, not deliberate obscurity.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No. While authorities (lawyer, police, FBI, ATF, expert) are cited, their statements are used to report facts, context, or opinions relevant to the story, not as evidence to support a specific propagandistic claim.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No. The text presents a nuanced situation involving legal sales, lack of suspicion, investigative interest, and expert opinion. It does not reduce the issue to only two stark choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No. There are no phrases used to shut down critical thought. The text presents information and perspectives for consideration.
16. **Red herring** – No. The details presented (ammo sale, investigation status, autopsy release, Haig's background) are all relevant to the core story of the ammo dealer and the investigation. Nothing appears deliberately distracting.
17. **Straw men** – No. No arguments are misrepresented or refuted. The lawyer defends his client's actions against implied criticism, but does so by addressing the actual situation (lack of suspicion, legality), not a fabricated position.
18. **Whataboutism** – No. No opponent is charged with hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

**Verdict – 5% –** The text is overwhelmingly a factual news report detailing the statements of the ammunition dealer's lawyer, the investigation's status regarding that dealer, the release of autopsy reports, and relevant context about ammunition sales. It presents multiple perspectives (lawyer, law enforcement silence, expert opinion) without overtly favoring one. While it inherently deals with a highly charged event, the reporting itself focuses on conveying information and statements without employing the persuasive or manipulative techniques defined in the propaganda list. The minimal 5% acknowledges that the selection and framing of *any* news story can carry subtle implications, but there is no discernible intent here to propagandize. The purpose appears to be informational reporting on a specific aspect of the case.
