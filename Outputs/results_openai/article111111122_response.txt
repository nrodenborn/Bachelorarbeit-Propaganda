Verdict – 40% – The text contains elements of propaganda, such as doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to present a negative view of Trump's handling of the Kavanaugh nomination. However, the text also provides a detailed analysis and context, which suggests an attempt to inform rather than solely persuade. The presence of some propaganda techniques indicates a moderate likelihood of the text being propaganda, but it is not overwhelmingly so.
