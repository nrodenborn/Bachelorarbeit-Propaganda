Name calling – Yes – The headline refers to Keith Ellison as an "Accused Serial Woman Abuser," and the introductory section labels the Democratic party as a "corrupt party," "Democrat machine," and the "lawless party."

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times consecutively.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases intended to be repeated as a rallying cry.

Appeal to fear – No – The text does not directly try to instill fear in the audience about alternatives to a proposed idea. It focuses on discrediting an individual and a political party.

Doubt – Yes – The introductory "Flashback" section about Barack Obama and Jack Ryan is designed to cast doubt on the integrity and motives of the "Democrat machine" in the current case involving Keith Ellison.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline calls Ellison an "Accused Serial Woman Abuser." While he is accused of abuse by one ex-girlfriend, the word "serial" exaggerates the known allegations to suggest a pattern with multiple victims.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like "corrupt party," "Democrat machine," and "lawless party" to evoke negative emotions and stereotypes.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that the reader should support an idea because it is already popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The introductory section simplifies the 2004 Senate race by implying that Barack Obama won solely because the "Democrat machine" unsealed his opponent's divorce records: "Ryan resigned. Obama took the field."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its accusations and framing; it does not use deliberately unclear or obscure expressions.

Appeal to authority – No – While the text cites sources like the Star Tribune and political figures, it does not use their authority as the primary evidence for its own biased claims. The bias comes from the framing, not from citing an expert to validate a point.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy with the line "Different rules for the lawless party," implying there are only two kinds of political actors: the corrupt Democrats and everyone else.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases or clichés intended to discourage critical thought.

Red herring – Yes – The text inserts a completely irrelevant poll ("Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?") in the middle of the article, distracting the reader from the main topic.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent an opponent's argument in order to attack it. It makes direct accusations.

Whataboutism – Yes – The article begins not with the main subject (Keith Ellison), but with a story about Barack Obama from 2004. This is a form of whataboutism, deflecting to a past event involving another member of the same party to allege hypocrisy and set a negative frame.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a deeply negative view of Keith Ellison and the Democratic Party. The piece strategically frames a news story with a highly biased introduction that employs whataboutism, name calling ("corrupt party," "lawless party"), and causal oversimplification to establish a narrative of corruption. The headline itself uses exaggeration ("Serial Woman Abuser") and name calling to create a strong negative impression before the reader even begins. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant and repetitive poll serves as a red herring to distract and potentially harvest user data. While the core of the text does report on a real event (the Star Tribune's lawsuit), this factual component is weaponized by the surrounding propagandistic framing, making the entire piece an exercise in political persuasion rather than objective journalism.
