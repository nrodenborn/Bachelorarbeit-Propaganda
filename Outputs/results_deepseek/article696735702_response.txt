Here is the analysis of the text using the specified propaganda techniques:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "The Daily Sheeple" (insulting label for mainstream media consumers).
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated emphasis on timeline inconsistencies (e.g., "6 minutes between Campos being shot and Paddock opening fire" mentioned multiple times).
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans.
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Suggests the official narrative is unreliable, implying the public is being misled about a major tragedy: "everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny."
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Systematically questions official accounts: "the entirety [of the] official story [is] into question."
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates the collapse of the narrative: "the entire official narrative... is falling apart." Minimizes official explanations by framing them as constantly changing.
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or group identity.
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Uses emotionally charged terms like "massacre," "falling apart," and "rushed and unprepared."
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association of ideas with hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees").
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes Paddock’s possible accidental death solely to panic/adrenaline: "the plausibility of Paddock accidentally killing himself amid the confusion, adrenaline and panic is quite high," ignoring other potential factors.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are presented concretely (e.g., specific timelines, named sources).
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites Twitter users (Thomas Wictor, Mr. Alex) as credible sources for the accidental suicide theory.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Implies only two options: the official narrative is false or the alternative (accidental suicide/cover-up) is true, dismissing middle-ground possibilities.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "case closed" or "just common sense" to end debate.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Introduces irrelevant details like "eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard" and "possible connections to a terrorist organization" to distract from core facts.
17. **Straw men** – No – Does not refute an argument never made by officials.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy targeting critics.

---

**Verdict – 85% –** The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs multiple techniques (e.g., **doubt**, **loaded language**, **causal oversimplification**, **red herring**) to manipulate perception. The core strategy is to erode trust in official sources ("law enforcement and mainstream media") by amplifying inconsistencies while promoting an unverified alternative theory (accidental suicide). Selective framing (e.g., emphasizing the 6-minute gap without context) and appeals to non-official "authorities" (Twitter users) further signal an agenda-driven narrative. Though it cites factual details (e.g., timeline revisions), these are weaponized to imply a cover-up rather than encourage neutral scrutiny. The lack of counter-evidence or balanced analysis reinforces its propagandistic intent.
