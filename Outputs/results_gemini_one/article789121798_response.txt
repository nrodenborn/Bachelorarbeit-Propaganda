Name calling – Yes – The text refers to the political opposition and the accuser’s side as "well-documented liars" and "The Washington establishment politicians act like children".

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses the well-known political slogan associated with Donald Trump: "a man promising to Drain the Swamp".

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting that believing this accuser will have dangerous future consequences: "next time a man is nominated to a position who really has committed a crime, people will be that much less likely to believe his accuser."

Doubt – Yes – The entire premise of the article is to cast doubt on the accuser's credibility. It explicitly states, "taken together as a whole, it’s far too suspicious to lend it any credibility."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the behavior of politicians ("They kick and scream and lie and pout") and minimizes the allegation as an "ambiguous-at-best claim".

Flag-Waving – Yes – The author appeals to a specific American identity by framing the argument from the perspective of "a regular Joe American" against the political establishment.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged and biased language, such as "pathetic attempt at a smear campaign" and "dig up some Trump-hating woman".

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis to discredit an idea or group.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text appeals to the idea of group consensus as proof of character by stating that Kavanaugh has "75 women publicly vouching for his character".

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex situation of the sexual assault allegation to a single, simple cause: a political plot by Democrats to delay a vote. "All they have to do is delay the confirmation... So, they dig up some Trump-hating woman... to say that he assaulted her".

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very direct and assertive in its claims, rather than being intentionally vague or obscure. It even claims "These are the facts. This is not my opinion."

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the FBI as an authority to bolster its argument, stating the nominee "has been investigated by the FBI six times prior" as evidence of his good character.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the political landscape as having only two absolute sides: "Immediately every Democrat publicly stated that they would vote No for his confirmation. On the other hand, every Republican publicly stated that they would vote Yes."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a phrase designed to shut down discussion and dismiss any alternative viewpoints: "These are the facts. This is not my opinion. Everything else is just noise."

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a completely irrelevant poll about Nikki Haley's replacement in the middle of the article, which serves to distract the reader from the main argument.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the position of the accuser's side by stating, "Ladies, you demand to be believed, no matter what." This creates an easily attackable, exaggerated version of the actual argument.

Whataboutism – No – The text attacks its opponents for their alleged current actions and motivations, not by deflecting criticism by charging them with hypocrisy on a different matter.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint by employing a high density and wide array of propaganda techniques. The article systematically uses emotional manipulation (Name Calling, Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear), logical fallacies (Causal Oversimplification, Straw Man, Black & White Fallacy), and rhetorical tricks to control the narrative (Doubt, Thought-Terminating Clichés, Red Herring). It constructs a simple "us vs. them" narrative, pitting the "regular Joe American" against a corrupt, childish political establishment. By explicitly stating "These are the facts. This is not my opinion," it attempts to present a highly biased and speculative argument as objective truth, a core function of modern propaganda. The sheer number of techniques identified (15 out of 18) demonstrates that the text is a deliberate effort to manipulate reader perception rather than engage in a reasoned, factual discussion.
