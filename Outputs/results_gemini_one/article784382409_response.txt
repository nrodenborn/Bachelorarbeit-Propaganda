Verdict – 100% – This text is a clear and overt piece of propaganda. It employs a vast majority of the listed techniques to achieve its goal, which is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a negative view of Keith Ellison and the Democratic party. The article systematically uses emotional manipulation through Name Calling ("frightened puppy"), Loaded Language ("demonic teachings"), and Appeal to Fear. It relies heavily on logical fallacies like Causal Oversimplification (blaming his religion for alleged actions), Black & White Fallacy (framing the election as a choice between justice and evil), and Whataboutism (accusing Democrats of hypocrisy). The piece attempts to establish credibility by Appealing to Authority (police reports, a journalist) while simultaneously using techniques like Red Herring (the irrelevant poll) to distract the reader. The sheer density and combination of these techniques demonstrate a deliberate intent to manipulate the audience's perception rather than present a factual, balanced account.
