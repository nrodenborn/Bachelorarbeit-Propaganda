Here is the analysis of the text based on the provided propaganda techniques:

Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly labels the subjects with insulting terms such as "Islamic compound jihadis" and "extremist Muslim."

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times in a row. The word "Shame!" is also repeated for emphasis.

Slogans – No – The text does not employ brief, memorable phrases that act as slogans.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by stating that the children were being "trained to use firearms and taught multiple tactical techniques in order to kill teachers, law enforcement and other institution."

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the integrity of the judicial system with phrases like "Shame on those who are supposed to uphold law and justice!" and calls the judge's decision "folly."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The headline "Sharia New Mexico" is an exaggeration that frames a single judge's bond ruling as the implementation of Islamic law across an entire state.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a group identity by creating a sharp contrast between how the justice system and media would allegedly treat "Christian and white" people versus how they are treating the "Muslims" in this case.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to evoke a strong reaction, such as "compound jihadis," "malnourished children living in squalor," and "sharia trumps dead children."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare an idea or group to the Nazis or another widely hated historical group to discredit it.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular. In fact, it suggests the opposite, positioning its view against a "Leftist acceptance" that it claims is mainstream.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple and inflammatory reason for a complex legal decision, stating the suspects were released "Because sharia trumps dead children," ignoring the legal nuances of a bond hearing.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; its language is direct, blunt, and intended to convey a very specific and clear message.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites and quotes sources it presents as credible authorities to bolster its argument, including "Jihad Watch," "Pamela Geller," and "Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by arguing that if the suspects "had been Christian and white," the outcome and media coverage would have been completely different, ignoring a spectrum of other possibilities.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text explicitly defines a term as a device to stop critical thought: "’Islamophobia’ is a thought crushing device designed to silence any and critics and criticism of Islam."

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll about Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation, which is entirely unrelated to the New Mexico case, serving as a distraction.

Straw men – Yes – The text responds to the defense lawyer's claim of a "double standard" by creating and attacking an exaggerated, hypothetical argument of what media coverage would look like for a Christian group ("CNN and MSNBC would be running special reports on toxic Christianity"), which was not the argument being made.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text attempts to show hypocrisy in the justice system by deflecting to other cases, stating, "The Bundys and their supporters got nearly two years in jail and no one hurt a single person!"

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and overt example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly emotional, and negative viewpoint. The piece utilizes an overwhelming majority (15 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques.

The text relentlessly employs emotional manipulation through **Loaded Language** ("jihadis," "squalor"), **Name Calling** ("extremist Muslim"), and **Appeal to Fear** (children trained to kill). It builds its argument on a foundation of logical fallacies, including a blatant **Red Herring** (the Kavanaugh poll), a **Straw Man** (the exaggerated media response to a hypothetical Christian group), **Causal Oversimplification** ("Because sharia trumps dead children"), and a **Black & White Fallacy** (the Christian vs. Muslim scenario).

Furthermore, it frames its narrative using **Exaggeration** ("Sharia New Mexico"), appeals to in-group identity (**Flag-Waving**), and cites partisan sources as evidence (**Appeal to Authority**). The use of **Repetition** and the direct definition of a **Thought-Terminating Cliché** show a deliberate effort to control the discourse and discourage critical thinking. The combination of these techniques creates a powerful piece of persuasive writing designed to provoke outrage and reinforce a specific ideology rather than engage in a factual, reasoned discussion of the event.
