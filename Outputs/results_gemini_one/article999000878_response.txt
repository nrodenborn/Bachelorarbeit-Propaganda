Name calling – Yes – The text uses an insulting label in one of the poll options to attack Jim Acosta: "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the exact same poll question three times in a row to reinforce the message: "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?"

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases that function as a slogan.

Appeal to fear – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear about the consequences of a particular course of action. It focuses more on justifying a past action.

Doubt – No – While the article presents conflicting reports (Donaldson vs. CNN's statement), it does not use this to systematically question the credibility of a person or institution as a primary technique. It simply reports on a developing story before presenting its own biased conclusion.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates Acosta's actions by stating he "used his hand to forcefully push the female interns arm away," while simultaneously minimizing the President's role by claiming he was "making a sincere effort" and was "rightfully losing his patients [sic]".

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make any appeals to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's opinion, such as describing the incident as a "tussle" and Acosta's questioning as a "sharp back-and-forth," and claiming he acted "forcefully."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to the Nazis or other hated groups.

Bandwagon – Yes – The text includes a poll, which is a technique to suggest that the reader's opinion is part of a larger, popular consensus. The framing of the poll encourages readers to join a side.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex issue of revoking a press pass (which involves First Amendment rights) to a simple cause: Acosta was rude and "refused to hand the mic over," therefore, "He deserved to have his credentials revoked."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text, particularly in its concluding paragraphs, is direct and clear in its biased viewpoint rather than being intentionally vague.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites "ABC’s former White House correspondent Sam Donaldson" and "constitutional lawyer Floyd Mayweather" to lend credibility to the news of the lawsuit.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation with only two outcomes in its final paragraphs: President Trump was making a "sincere effort" and was "rightful," while Acosta was disruptive and wrong. The poll option "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass" also frames the issue as a simple choice between supporting Acosta or condemning his "childish" behavior.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The final sentence, "He deserved to have his credentials revoked," is presented as a final, indisputable judgment that discourages any further thought or discussion on the nuances of the situation.

Red herring – No – The article remains focused on the topic of Jim Acosta's press pass and the resulting lawsuit. It does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the reader.

Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent an opponent's argument in order to refute it. Instead, it largely ignores counter-arguments in favor of presenting its own one-sided narrative.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any party of hypocrisy by pointing to their own past actions.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it begins by reporting factual elements of a news story, it strategically employs numerous propaganda techniques to guide the reader toward a specific, biased conclusion. The piece uses loaded language and name-calling ("act like a child") to create a negative emotional impression of Jim Acosta. It presents a black & white fallacy, framing the event as a simple case of Acosta being wrong and deserving of punishment, which is a causal oversimplification of a complex legal and constitutional issue. The use of a repetitive, leading poll serves as a bandwagon technique, and the article concludes with a thought-terminating cliché ("He deserved to have his credentials revoked") that shuts down nuanced debate. The shift from a seemingly objective news report to a one-sided, opinionated judgment is a deliberate structure designed to manipulate the reader's perception.
