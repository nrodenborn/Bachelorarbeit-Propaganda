**Verdict – 80% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and straw men. These techniques are used to shape the reader's perception of the situation, casting doubt on the credibility of the allegations and portraying the Democrats' actions as purely strategic and deceitful. The presence of these techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is propaganda.**
