### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques:

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against Haig; he is neutrally described as "an Arizona man," "ammunition dealer," or "aerospace engineer."  
2. **Repetition** – No – Key terms like "armor-piercing bullets" appear but are not excessively repeated; usage is factual.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., rallying cries) are present.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text reports facts without evoking fear about alternatives (e.g., gun control policies).  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility (e.g., of the FBI, courts, or evidence).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Details are stated factually (e.g., "720 rounds," "killed 58 people") without amplification or downplaying.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or identity (e.g., "American values" or "national security").  
8. **Loaded Language** – No – Language is neutral (e.g., "manufacturing armor-piercing bullets" lacks emotional or stereotyping connotations).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No attempts to link Haig or his actions to hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No suggestion that the charges align with popular opinion.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text avoids assigning blame beyond Haig’s specific role; complexity (e.g., motives for the shooting) is not oversimplified.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are clear and specific (e.g., dates, charges, evidence like fingerprints).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – References to the FBI/complaint are evidentiary, not manipulative (e.g., "A complaint says...").  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dilemmas (e.g., "only Haig is responsible") are presented; context is nuanced.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases (e.g., "common sense") that shut down discussion; facts invite scrutiny.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All details (e.g., Haig’s license status, his statement) are directly relevant.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented arguments are refuted; the text reports charges, not debates.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., "others sold ammo too") are made.  

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 5% –** The text is a straightforward news report citing verifiable facts (e.g., legal charges, evidence, Haig’s statements) without persuasive language, emotional manipulation, or partisan framing. Its neutrality, reliance on official documents (complaint), and absence of the listed propaganda techniques indicate journalistic reporting rather than propaganda. The 5% margin acknowledges potential subtle bias in emphasizing "armor-piercing bullets" (which could imply greater severity), but this aligns with factual relevance to the charges, not systematic persuasion.
