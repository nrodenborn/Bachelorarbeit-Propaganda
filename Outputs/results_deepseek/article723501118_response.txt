### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – Yes – "hopeless hellhole," "refugee war criminals and terrorists," "bureaucrats with badges."  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – Repeated sarcastic use of "Maybe we should be more like Sweden?" (phrased similarly in title, intro, and body).  
3. **Slogans** – No – No distinct, standalone memorable phrase (title is descriptive, not condensed).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Describes Sweden as "terrorized by warring foreign gangs," "deadly shootings," and grenade deaths to instill fear about immigration.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Of course they can't cope" dismisses police efficacy; "Why would anyone associate rising crime and immigration?" sarcastically questions skepticism about the link.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "hopeless hellhole," "Demolition Man in real life," "warring foreign gangs." Minimization: Downplays Sweden’s low murder rate by focusing on "surged" gang violence.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Terrorized," "war criminals," "mass repression," "hopeless hellhole" evoke strong negative emotions/stereotypes.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on popularity to sway opinion.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames immigration as the primary/sole cause of gang violence: "the gangs in question are immigrant gangs."  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are direct, not obscured.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Partial – Cites PM Lofven’s military threat but selectively to support the anti-immigration narrative, not as neutral evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents immigration as leading only to chaos ("hellhole") versus military crackdown as the solution.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "That tells you everything" shuts down critical analysis of the military-vs-migration framing.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Shifts focus to Denmark’s "Loyal to Familia" gang expanding to Sweden, distracting from broader context.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Misrepresents "Progressives say we should be more like Sweden" as endorsing chaos/taxation, ignoring typical progressive arguments about social policies.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy.  

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic, employing at least 10 of the 18 techniques analyzed. Its core purpose is to frame immigration as an existential threat using fear-based rhetoric ("terrorized," "deadly shootings"), oversimplified causality (immigration = gang violence), and emotionally loaded language ("hellhole," "war criminals"). It dismisses counter-narratives (e.g., Sweden’s low murder rate) while amplifying isolated incidents (grenade death). The sarcastic repetition of "be more like Sweden" constructs a straw man to ridicule opponents, and thought-terminating clichés ("That tells you everything") preclude nuanced discussion. Though it cites the PM and crime statistics, these are cherry-picked to fuel alarmism, not balanced debate. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of factual elements (e.g., funding for police), but these are weaponized to support a singular, inflammatory agenda: discrediting immigration and progressive policies. The tone, structure, and techniques align unambiguously with propaganda aimed at manipulating emotions and simplifying complex socio-political issues.
