Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1. **Name calling – Yes**  
   Explanation: Repeatedly uses "kritarch" as an insulting label for judges (e.g., "Kritarch Patti Saris", "minor kritarchs") and "Treason Bar attorney" to discredit lawyers.  

2. **Repetition – Yes**  
   Explanation: "Kritarch" is repeated 8 times, and "illegal aliens" 7 times, reinforcing negative framing.  

3. **Slogans – No**  
   Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., like "Build the Wall") are used; the text relies on narrative arguments.  

4. **Appeal to fear – Yes**  
   Explanation: Implies releasing immigrants risks public safety (e.g., Judge Goldsmith’s order could free "criminal aliens" into the community).  

5. **Doubt – Yes**  
   Explanation: Questions judges' credibility (e.g., "Saris should know... her decision will be struck down," suggesting incompetence).  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes**  
   Explanation: Minimizes judges' authority by calling them "minor kritarchs" and exaggerates rulings as creating "an unlimited number of hearings."  

7. **Flag-Waving – Yes**  
   Explanation: Appeals to patriotism via "lawful immigration policies of President Trump" and "unconstitutional #Resistance," framing opposition as anti-American.  

8. **Loaded Language – Yes**  
   Explanation: Uses emotionally charged terms like "illegal aliens," "absconding," "fleeing and hiding," and "Treason Bar" to evoke anger/suspicion.  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No**  
   Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups; criticisms focus on legal overreach.  

10. **Bandwagon – No**  
    Explanation: No appeal to popularity (e.g., "everyone agrees"); arguments are based on legal authority, not trends.  

11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes**  
    Explanation: Blames judges solely for immigrants fleeing (e.g., Saris "encourage[d] illegal aliens... to flee"), ignoring systemic factors.  

12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No**  
    Explanation: Language is direct and accusatory (e.g., "acted outside the law"); no deliberate ambiguity.  

13. **Appeal to authority – Yes**  
    Explanation: Cites Justice Department arguments (e.g., "Federal law gives authority... to the executive branch") to validate claims.  

14. **Black & white fallacy – Yes**  
    Explanation: Presents deportation as binary: either immediate removal or "unlimited" delays (e.g., "Illegal aliens get only one hearing...").  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes**  
    Explanation: Phrases like "illegal and unconstitutional #Resistance" shut down debate by dismissing dissent as treasonous.  

16. **Red herring – Yes**  
    Explanation: Introduces Judge Goldsmith’s unrelated case about Iraqi immigrants to distract from the primary critique of Saris.  

17. **Straw men – Yes**  
    Explanation: Misrepresents judges' rulings as wanting "unlimited hearings" when they sought limited extensions for appeals.  

18. **Whataboutism – No**  
    Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., unlike the example about Trump’s military service).

**Verdict – 95% –**  
The text is highly likely to be propaganda due to pervasive use of manipulative techniques. It employs **name-calling** ("kritarch"), **repetition**, **loaded language** ("illegal aliens"), and **emotional appeals** to delegitimize judges and immigrants. It **oversimplifies** complex legal processes, creates **false dichotomies**, and uses **thought-terminating clichés** ("#Resistance") to suppress nuance. While it cites factual elements (e.g., court rulings), these are framed to provoke outrage and advance a specific agenda: opposing judicial intervention in deportations. The consistent bias, lack of neutral analysis, and reliance on multiple propaganda techniques indicate a clear intent to persuade rather than inform. The 5% uncertainty accounts for minor factual references, but these do not offset the overwhelming propagandistic tone.
