1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Amber Guyger as a "killer cop" and her apartment as "the killer’s apartment."

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states that with Guyger gone, "residents can certainly sleep better knowing that they don’t have to fear a killer cop walking into their apartment and murdering them," directly appealing to the reader's fear of police violence.
5. Doubt – Yes – The article is centered on creating doubt about the integrity of the police investigation, quoting an attorney who says, "The affidavit isn’t written objectively, not at the slightest," to question the credibility of law enforcement.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by stating that the police "attempted to assassinate Jean’s character" for releasing information that they found a small amount of marijuana.

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The article highlights that "activists rallied" and "blocked traffic," showing a photo of the protest to suggest that this is a popular cause that the reader should also support.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The article attributes all the events and alleged investigative failures to a single cause: Amber Guyger receiving "special treatment" because she is a police officer, ignoring any other potential complexities.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article is very direct in its claims and accusations and does not use vague or obscure language.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses "Attorney Stephen Le Brocq" and news outlet "WFAA" as authorities to lend credibility to its claims about the biased affidavit and the details of the search warrants.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The article presents the situation as a simple binary of "injustice" caused by "special treatment" versus the side of the victim, leaving no room for nuance or alternative explanations for the police's actions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "my son’s life matters" is used as an emotionally powerful statement that is difficult to argue against, effectively discouraging further critical discussion.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll embedded in the article, "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?", is completely irrelevant to the topic and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The article sets up and refutes the implicit argument that the investigation is being handled in a standard, objective manner, a position that is not explicitly stated by any opponent within the text.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy on another matter; it remains focused on the central case.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast majority (13 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques to construct a persuasive, one-sided narrative rather than an objective news report. The article's primary goal is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint: that Amber Guyger received "special treatment" from a corrupt police force. This is achieved through the pervasive use of loaded language ("slaying," "insidious," "killer cop"), name-calling, and appeals to fear and emotion. It simplifies a complex event into a single cause (causal oversimplification) and presents the situation as a black-and-white struggle against "injustice." The use of an authority (an attorney) and the bandwagon technique (highlighting protests) are strategically employed to build credibility and a sense of popular support. Finally, the inclusion of a completely irrelevant poll serves as a blatant red herring. While the article reports on factual events, the framing, word choice, and rhetorical strategies are all classic hallmarks of propaganda.
