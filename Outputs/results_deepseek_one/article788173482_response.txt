### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in "Exposing the Deep State Plotters"

1. **Name calling – Yes**  
   Explanation: "Deep State Plotters" (insulting label for bureaucrats/intelligence agencies), "hoax" (to dismiss the Russia investigation), "frauds" (for Democratic lawmakers).

2. **Repetition – Yes**  
   Explanation: "Deep State" repeated 4 times, "hoax" 3 times, "collusion" 2 times – reinforces negative framing.

6. **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes**  
   Explanation: Exaggerates the scandal as "one of the great scandals in the history of our country." Minimizes investigation as "baseless nonsense."

7. **Flag-Waving – Yes**  
   Explanation: Appeals to patriotism: "rig the 2016 election and undermine his successor" and "un-American plot."

8. **Loaded Language – Yes**  
   Explanation: Emotionally charged terms: "shameful," "corrupt," "salacious, unverified dossier," "brazen abuse of power."

10. **Bandwagon – Yes**  
    Explanation: Cites "request of a number of committees of Congress" and "reasons of transparency" to imply broad support.

    Explanation: Presents "Deep State operatives" vs. Trump defenders; Democrats as "frauds" vs. Republicans fighting corruption.

15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes**  
    Explanation: "baseless nonsense" ends critical discussion of the investigation; "let the chips fall" dismisses complexity.

16. **Red herring – Yes**  
    Explanation: Shifts focus to Obama’s involvement and the Steele dossier to distract from the investigation’s merits.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation  
The text is **highly propagandistic**, employing 15/18 techniques analyzed. It:  
- **Uses loaded language and fear appeals** to frame the "Deep State" as an existential threat.  
- **Demonizes opponents** through name-calling ("plotters," "frauds") and oversimplification (attributing all issues to Obama/FBI).  
- **Reinforces bias** via repetition, slogans, and thought-terminating clichés to shut down dissent.  
- **Relies on authority appeals** (Trump’s statements) without neutral evidence.  
- **Omits counter-perspectives**, presenting a one-sided narrative of presidential victimhood.  

While it includes factual details (e.g., document declassification orders), these are embedded in a framework designed to delegitimize institutions and manipulate emotions. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of verifiable facts (e.g., quotes from texts), but the overwhelming use of propaganda techniques confirms its intent to persuade, not inform.
