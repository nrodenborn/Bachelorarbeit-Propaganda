1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack its subjects, such as “Illegal Alien ‘Caravan’”, “border-crashers”, “Fake News”, and “Crooked Hillary”.
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message of Trump being a strong leader who keeps his promises is repeated throughout the text, reinforced with phrases like “Trump will find other ways to secure our Southern border as he had promised to do,” “Trump is still keeping promises,” and the hashtag “#PromisesKept”.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases like “#PromisesKept” and borrows the famous movie line “He’ll be back” to create a slogan for Trump’s 2020 campaign.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text implicitly appeals to fear by framing the migrants as “border-crashers” and a threat that requires a response like “RAZOR wire,” suggesting a dangerous alternative if these measures are not taken.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text actively works to create doubt about the credibility of the media, stating, “The Fake News is showing old footage” and accusing CNN of having “little fever dreams.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates Trump’s persona by calling him “The Trumpinator” and exaggerates the failure of his opponents by saying CNN’s ratings are “circling the toilet.” It minimizes the complex reasons for migration by labeling people simply as “border-crashers.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by focusing on the theme of national security, “secure our Southern border,” and defending the nation from outside forces.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words intended to create a strong reaction, such as “Illegal Alien,” “border-crashers,” “razor wire,” and “Happy Warriors.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest any idea is popular with hated groups like Nazis to discredit it.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text appeals to popularity by reminding the audience of Trump’s past victories (“He survived the primaries and got the nomination. He knocked out Crooked Hillary”) to suggest his ongoing success and momentum.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex event by stating, “The economy is doing exactly what he promised it would,” attributing the state of the entire economy to a single person’s actions.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text’s language is blunt and direct, not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the President’s support as evidence of truth, quoting him directly (“This is what it really looks like – no climbers anymore under our Administration!”) to counter the “Fake News.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a world of only two options: you are either with Trump and his supporters (“Happy Warriors”) or you are part of the opposition (“Fake News,” “Leftism,” “Crooked Hillary”).
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like “Fake News” and “#PromisesKept” to dismiss opposing viewpoints and discourage critical discussion.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces an irrelevant link (“Trending: WATCH: Lingerie Clad Hottie…”) to distract the reader. It also pivots from the border wall to the Mueller investigation to list more of Trump’s perceived victories, distracting from the main topic.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an exaggerated argument that was not likely presented by major news outlets by claiming, “when CNN and the rest had their little fever dreams about cross-border gun battles,” creating an easy-to-refute caricature of media coverage.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses on direct attacks rather than deflecting criticism by charging opponents with hypocrisy in the "what about..." format.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a highly polarized political viewpoint and to take specific actions (subscribe, donate). The piece employs a dense concentration of propaganda techniques, leaving little room for objective reporting. It systematically uses name-calling and loaded language (“Illegal Alien,” “border-crashers”) to dehumanize opponents and create an “us vs. them” narrative. It actively discredits alternative sources of information through techniques like doubt (“Fake News”) and straw men (misrepresenting CNN’s coverage). The arguments rely heavily on emotional manipulation (appeal to fear, flag-waving) and logical fallacies (causal oversimplification, black & white fallacy) rather than reasoned debate. The sheer volume and variety of these techniques, woven into every part of the text, confirm its nature as propaganda designed to reinforce a specific ideology and rally support.
