Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "deep state plot" (Used as an insulting label for government actors perceived as anti-Trump).
2. **Repetition** – No – No specific phrase or message is repeated verbatim throughout the text.
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed as slogans (e.g., "Make America Great Again") are used.
4. **Appeal to fear** – Partial (Weak) – The mention of the "deep state plot to 'stop' Trump" implies a threat to democracy, but it's not the primary support for an idea. Not strongly present.
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "raised concerns but solved none of the lingering mysteries" (Directly casts doubt on the IG report's completeness and the FBI/DOJ's actions).
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes (Exaggeration) – "tens of thousands of texts" (Likely an exaggeration for emphasis regarding Strzok/Page texts) and describing Gowdy's exchange as "devastating" (Subjective intensification).
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or national identity is made.
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "predictable performance," "lingering mysteries," "devastating exchange," "deep state plot," "false information," "unfounded personal attacks, political games" (Emotionally charged words/phrases conveying strong negative judgment).
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association of ideas/people with universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "Democrats echoed the IG report’s conclusion" (Implies Democrats are blindly following a position, appealing to groupthink).
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – "prejudging the outcome... is the 'textbook definition of bias'" (Presents bias as the sole, simple explanation for complex investigative decisions).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – While Horowitz avoids specifics (e.g., volume of Obama-Clinton emails, subject matter), this reflects lack of knowledge or refusal to answer, not deliberate *intent* to confuse with vague language.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No external authority is cited to support claims. References are to participants or the report itself.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The framing of the "textbook definition of bias" exchange presents the situation as purely about prejudgment (bias) vs. no bias, ignoring potential nuances or other factors in decision-making.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "textbook definition of bias" (Used by Gowdy to shut down complex discussion of the investigation's integrity with a simple, definitive label).
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Discussing President Obama's communications with Clinton on her email server (Irrelevant to the core question of bias in the *FBI's handling* of the Clinton investigation).
17. **Straw men** – Partial (Weak) – "repeated one of Clinton’s claims about her negligence" (Slightly misrepresents the IG report's focus on the markings as endorsing Clinton's claim, though the report states it as a factual finding).
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – "When the reality is it was Jim Comey who softened and watered down his press release, announcing no charges against Secretary Clinton." (Gowdy deflects criticism of Horowitz by pointing to Comey's past actions regarding Clinton).

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. While reporting factual events (testimony, report findings), its language is heavily loaded ("devastating," "deep state plot," "predictable performance," "false information") to cast the FBI, DOJ, Clinton, and Obama in a negative light and defenders of Trump (like Gowdy) as truth-tellers. It employs Name Calling ("deep state"), Doubt (on the IG/FBI), Exaggeration ("tens of thousands," "devastating"), Loaded Language (pervasive), Bandwagon (Democrats echoing), Causal Oversimplification ("textbook bias"), Black & White Fallacy (bias vs. no bias), Thought-terminating clichés ("textbook bias"), Red Herring (Obama emails), and Whataboutism (deflecting to Comey/Clinton). The narrative selectively focuses on points supporting anti-FBI/anti-Clinton/pro-Trump narratives while downplaying or dismissing counter-evidence (e.g., the IG's conclusion of "no bias" affecting decisions is mentioned but immediately contrasted with Republican challenges). The term "deep state plot" is a definitive propaganda label. The overall purpose is clearly to persuade the reader of a specific, partisan interpretation of events rather than provide a neutral account. The high percentage reflects the density and variety of techniques used to shape perception.
