Based on the definitions provided and the text analysis, here is the breakdown for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling – Yes** – Trump calls Mueller "Disgraced and discredited" and his team a "group of Angry Democrat Thugs" and a "gang". These are insulting labels.
2.  **Repetition – No** – While Trump criticizes the investigation multiple times, the *same specific phrase or message* is not repeated verbatim enough to qualify.
3.  **Slogans – No** – There are no brief, memorable phrases used repeatedly as slogans within the text itself (e.g., "Rigged Witch Hunt" is mentioned but not used repeatedly *in this specific text* as a slogan).
4.  **Appeal to fear – No** – The text does not attempt to instill fear against alternatives to support an idea. Trump criticizes the investigation but doesn't use fear of consequences to promote an alternative.
5.  **Doubt – Yes** – Trump questions the credibility of the Mueller investigation by claiming "they know there is no Russian Collusion," implying the investigation is baseless or dishonest.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization – Yes** – Trump *minimizes* the potential seriousness of campaign collusion with Russia by calling it a "phony crime." He also potentially *exaggerates* the nature of the investigation by calling it "looking for trouble."
7.  **Flag-Waving – No** – There is no appeal to patriotism or national identity in the text.
8.  **Loaded Language – Yes** – Terms like "Disgraced and discredited," "Angry Democrat Thugs," "gang," "phony crime," "Rigged Witch Hunt," and "looking for trouble" are emotionally charged and rely on stereotypes or negative connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum – No** – No attempt is made to link the investigation or its targets to universally hated groups like Nazis.
10. **Bandwagon – No** – Trump does not appeal to the popularity of his position or the investigation's unpopularity to convince others.
11. **Causal Oversimplification – Yes** – Trump concludes Mueller is "looking for trouble" *simply because* "they know there is no Russian Collusion," ignoring other potential legitimate reasons for a lengthy investigation (e.g., investigating obstruction, conspiracy, false statements).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No** – Trump's statements are inflammatory but relatively clear in their intent. The text itself reports clearly.
13. **Appeal to authority – No** – While Alberto Gonzales is cited as an authority by the *reporter* to counter Trump's point, Trump himself does not use an authority figure's support to bolster his arguments within the quoted text.
14. **Black & white fallacy – No** – The text doesn't present a situation with only two extreme choices. Trump complains about being criticized, but doesn't frame the overall issue as a simple binary.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés – Yes** – Phrases like "no Russian Collusion," "phony crime," and "Rigged Witch Hunt" are used to dismiss the investigation and discourage deeper analysis of its findings or legitimacy.
16. **Red herring – Possible, but weak** – Trump mentioning his approval of McGahn's testimony "for purposes of transparency" could be seen as introducing a positive point (transparency) to distract from the negative context (his attacks on the investigation and the potentially damaging nature of McGahn's testimony). However, it's directly related to the core subject (the investigation), so it's not a strong example.
17. **Straw men – No** – Trump attacks the investigation directly based on his perception of its motives ("looking for trouble") and alleged lack of basis ("no Collusion"), not a misrepresented version of an opponent's argument.
18. **Whataboutism – Yes** – Trump charges his critics with hypocrisy: "when I attempt to 'FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt,' his critics 'scream Obstruction!'". He implies their accusations of obstruction are hypocritical when he merely defends himself.

**Verdict – 40% –** The text itself is a news report *about* President Trump's propagandistic statements regarding the Mueller investigation. It directly quotes and reports on Trump's use of several propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Loaded Language, Doubt, Exaggeration/Minimization, Causal Oversimplification, Thought-terminating clichés, and Whataboutism). However, the article also provides context, counterpoints (e.g., Gonzales's legal opinion, the details of the Trump Tower meeting, legal experts noting potential crimes like conspiracy or obstruction), and factual reporting. It does not solely present Trump's viewpoint uncritically. Therefore, while it *contains* propaganda (originating from Trump), the text as a whole functions more as reporting *on* that propaganda rather than being pure propaganda itself. The likelihood of the *text* being propaganda is moderate (40%) because it disseminates the propaganda messages but within a framework that also provides opposing information and context.
