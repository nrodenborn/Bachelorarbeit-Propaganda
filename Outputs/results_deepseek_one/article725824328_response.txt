Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Syrian Christian crook" (referring to Tony Rezko).
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – No specific phrase or message is repeated throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases used as slogans are present.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "Malcolm X wasn’t adequately afraid of them. Here’s what happened to him:" (implying danger from the Nation of Islam, reinforced by the YouTube link). Also, Muhammad being "afraid that someone might 'break into his apartment'".
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The entire text questions Obama's associations and motives: "conservatives pushed multiple apparently racially motivated conspiracy theories", questioning ties to Farrakhan/Islam, "you might almost get the impression... he might side with... Black Lives Matter and encourage a wave of black rage".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: "encourage a wave of black rage and police retreat that drove up the death toll from murder by 20% in his last two years in office, an incremental death toll a little bigger than the U.S. combat death toll from the equally stupid Iraq War" (Attributing a complex rise in murder rates directly to Obama's perceived stance and BLM, while minimizing the causes of the Iraq War as "equally stupid").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Numerous examples: "racially motivated conspiracy theories", "Syrian Christian crook", "shaking down white institutions", "spiritual advisor" (in scare quotes), "wave of black rage", "police retreat", "stupid Iraq War".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis or Hitler.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to the popularity of an idea.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – "Reading Obama’s 1995 memoir, you might almost get the impression that after a prudent first term, during his second he might side with, I dunno, Black Lives Matter and encourage a wave of black rage and police retreat that drove up the death toll from murder by 20%..." (Oversimplifies the causes of the 2015-2016 murder rate increase, attributing it directly and solely to Obama's perceived alignment with BLM and lack of support for police).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – "them" (referring to the Nation of Islam/NOI leadership) is used vaguely and ominously multiple times: "Malcolm X wasn’t adequately afraid of them. Here’s what happened to him", "I was really, I guess, afraid of them". Also, "what was going on" when the CBC staffer contacted him.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Relies heavily on the statements and perspective of photographer Askia Muhammad to establish the significance and potential damage of the photo, and to validate the narrative: "Muhammad said...", "Muhammad told...", "Muhammad insisted...", "Muhammad thought...".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents Obama's approach to black economic advancement as a stark, oversimplified choice: "there is more economic upside for blacks in shaking down white institutions than in building their own" (based on Obama's interpretation of Farrakhan's failure).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "But after all, what could be more boring than a story than involves a Presidential candidate, the Syrian Christian crook who helped him buy his house, the Nation of Islam, and the most famous boxer of all time?" (Dismisses the complex Rezko-NOI-Ali-Obama connections as uninteresting to shut down inquiry).
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Introducing the comparison of the murder rate increase under Obama to US combat deaths in Iraq: "an incremental death toll a little bigger than the U.S. combat death toll from the equally stupid Iraq War." This distracts from the core topic (Obama/Farrakhan ties) with an emotionally charged but largely irrelevant comparison.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – No clear instance of refuting an argument that wasn't presented.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No direct charge of hypocrisy against an opponent based on their own actions.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It heavily relies on **Loaded Language** ("crook," "shaking down," "black rage," "stupid Iraq War"), **Appeal to Fear** (Malcolm X reference, break-in fears), **Doubt** (persistent questioning of Obama's associations and motives), **Causal Oversimplification** (linking Obama's memoir to murder rates), **Obfuscation** (vague "them"), and **Appeal to Authority** (Muhammad's perspective). It uses **Name Calling**, **Black & White Fallacy**, **Thought-terminating Clichés**, and a **Red Herring**. The core purpose is not objective reporting but to cast doubt on Obama's character and associations using insinuation, selective information, emotionally charged language, and logical fallacies, aligning with established conservative critiques and conspiracy theories mentioned within the text itself. The few techniques *not* used do not diminish the overall propagandistic intent and execution.
