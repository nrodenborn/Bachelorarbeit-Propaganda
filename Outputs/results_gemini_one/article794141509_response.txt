1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the group responsible for the purge as "Those Who Hate Freedom" and "People who hate freedom".
2. Repetition – Yes – The idea of a "coordinated effort" is repeated multiple times to reinforce the central thesis. Examples: "the alternative media purge was boldly advanced in a coordinated effort", "The fact that many of these accounts were also suspended by Twitter shortly thereafter should tell you that this is a coordinated effort", and "I can only speculate that these suspensions were a coordinated effort".
3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses the phrase "truth is treason" (quoted from Ron Paul) as a brief, memorable phrase to encapsulate its argument. Example: "Ron Paul reminds us that truth is treason."
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text is built around instilling fear in the reader. Examples: "Why the Coordinated Alternative Media Purge Should TERRIFY Everyone" and "People who hate freedom will get unfettered access to the minds of 2 billion people. That should scare the crap out of you."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text explicitly casts doubt on the official explanation provided by Facebook. Example: "The reason given doesn’t really add up."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration to heighten the perceived threat. Example: "Soon Those Who Hate Freedom Will Have Unquestioned Access to the Minds of 2 Billion People" and "We’re watching the biggest campaign against freedom of speech and thought that has ever occurred in our part of the world."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the identity of people who value freedom and constitutional rights. Example: "And this should terrify everyone who wants to be free to question the status quo" and the reference to the First Amendment.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words to influence the reader. Examples include "TERRIFY," "hate freedom," "monopoly on information," "empire of lies," and "brainwashing."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular; rather, it frames its side as a persecuted minority.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex issue of social media content moderation, spam policies, and foreign influence campaigns to a single, simple cause. Example: "this is a coordinated effort to silence large swaths of the population."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text's argument is direct and its claims are stated clearly, not hidden behind intentionally vague or obscure language.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from Ron Paul, described as "the libertarian voice of reason," and alternative journalists to lend credibility to its claims. Example: "Ron Paul, former senator and the libertarian voice of reason, said when Jones was purged: ... 'in an empire of lies the truth is treason.'"
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two sides: the truthful "alternative media" and the lying "establishment" which controls the flow of information. Example: "People will believe what they’re told because there is no alternative information presented."
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a phrase that discourages nuanced discussion by offering a simple, all-encompassing explanation for a complex event. Example: The quote "'in an empire of lies the truth is treason'" serves to dismiss any other potential reasons for the purge.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text includes a poll that is completely irrelevant to the article's topic, serving to distract the reader and collect user data. Example: "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?"
17. Straw men – Yes – The text focuses on the Washington Post's original URL ("pushing-political-messages-for-profit") to attack it for hypocrisy, rather than engaging with the publication's actual, updated headline and reasoning about "political spam."
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text deflects from the substance of the Washington Post's reporting by accusing the outlet of hypocrisy. Example: "But of course, since they too push political messages for profit (waaah, Trump!) as do all the other corporate media outlets out there, they changed their headline".

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary goal is not to inform in a balanced way, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, conspiratorial worldview through overwhelming emotional and logical manipulation. The article employs a very high density of propaganda techniques, weaving them together to create a powerful narrative of persecution and impending doom.

The entire piece is framed by an **Appeal to Fear** (the title commands the reader to be "TERRIFIED") and uses emotionally **Loaded Language** ("hate freedom," "brainwashing," "doomed") and **Name Calling** ("Those Who Hate Freedom") to create a strong emotional response. It establishes a stark **Black & White Fallacy**, pitting the heroic, truth-telling "alternative media" against a monolithic, evil "establishment."

The central argument relies on **Causal Oversimplification**, reducing the complex issue of content moderation to a "coordinated effort to silence" dissent, a claim reinforced through **Repetition**. It actively sows **Doubt** about official explanations and uses **Whataboutism** and **Straw Man** arguments to attack the credibility of mainstream sources like the Washington Post. To bolster its own credibility, it relies on **Appeal to Authority**, quoting figures like Ron Paul. The argument is amplified through **Exaggeration**, claiming this is the "biggest campaign against freedom of speech and thought that has ever occurred." The inclusion of a completely irrelevant poll is a textbook **Red Herring**.

The text does not engage in a good-faith discussion of a complex topic; instead, it uses a comprehensive suite of propaganda tactics to bypass critical thought and instill a specific belief and emotional state in the reader.
