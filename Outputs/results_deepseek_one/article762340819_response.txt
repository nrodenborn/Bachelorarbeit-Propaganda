Here is the analysis of the propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Obama’s Treason," "the worst President in American history," "black-hearted Presbyterian bigot" (referring to Wilson), "crook" (referring to Nixon), "sanctimony" (referring to Carter).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The accusation of "treason" is repeated throughout the text (e.g., "Obama’s Treason," "tried for treason," "the definition of treason," "treason on a scale").  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "Leftist Privilege" (used as a standalone phrase to dismiss accountability).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warnings of Iranian-backed terrorists crossing the border to commit "jihad massacres of Americans" and irreversible consequences from Obama’s actions.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "How was giving them billions and helping them skirt sanctions applied by the U.S. government not treason?" (questions the legitimacy of Obama’s actions).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: Calling Obama "the worst President in American history," claiming he gave "hundreds of billions of dollars" to Iran (the text later specifies $1.7B). Minimization: Dismissing other presidents' flaws (e.g., "Nah" to Harding’s faults).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Cites U.S. Code 2381 (treason law) and emphasizes allegiance to the U.S., framing Obama as betraying national interests.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Treason," "Death to America," "jihad massacres," "worst President," "catastrophe," "betrayed," "mullahs," "irreversible winter" (fear appeal).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – Links Wilson to Hitler and WWII: "That black-hearted Presbyterian bigot arguably gave the world Hitler and World War II."  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity or group consensus.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames Wilson for Hitler and WWII ("arguably gave the world Hitler") and implies Obama’s actions alone enabled Iranian terrorism.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Arguments are inflammatory but not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites the House Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and U.S. Code 2381 to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Reduces Obama’s actions to "treason" with no middle ground; dismisses other presidents as merely "incompetent" or "corrupt" while insisting Obama is uniquely guilty.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Leftist Privilege" and "Laws are for conservatives" shut down discourse.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Long comparisons to other presidents (Fillmore, Grant, Wilson, etc.) distract from detailed evidence about Obama’s actions.  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – "There are those who say, ‘It was their money’" (misrepresents opposing views to easily refute them).  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Contrasts Trump’s actions ("restore sanctions") with Obama’s to imply hypocrisy/guilt: "Even as President Trump moves swiftly to restore sanctions... those billions cannot be recovered."  

---

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs at least 14 of the 18 techniques analyzed, including aggressive name-calling, emotional loaded language, fear appeals, repetition of unproven accusations (treason), and fallacious reasoning (black-and-white framing, straw men, causal oversimplification). Its central claim—that Obama committed treason—is presented as fact without judicial or bipartisan validation, relying on cherry-picked investigations and hyperbolic language to vilify the subject. The tone is inflammatory and one-sided, dismissing counterarguments (e.g., "It was their money") with oversimplified rebuttals. While it cites some sources (e.g., congressional reports), these are used selectively to support a preexisting narrative rather than enable balanced analysis. The closing lines ("Leftist Privilege... Laws are for conservatives") explicitly frame the issue through a partisan lens, discouraging critical engagement. The absence of nuanced discussion, reliance on emotional manipulation, and consistent use of multiple propaganda techniques confirm its nature as propaganda. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of factual elements (e.g., references to real investigations) but these are weaponized to serve the propagandistic objective.
