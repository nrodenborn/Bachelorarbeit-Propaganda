1. Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels such as “presstitutes” to attack the media, combining the words "press" and "prostitutes."

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases that stand on their own as slogans.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text instills fear by suggesting a “coup against the elected president” is underway and that if it succeeds, “America will be a complete dystopia and all independent voices will be shut down.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The text systematically questions the credibility of multiple institutions, referring to “Russiagate, a proven hoax,” “false indictments,” and “false arrest.”

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites President Dwight Eisenhower’s warning about the “military/industrial complex” to support its main argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy by stating that for Russia, “war or surrender is their only option,” ignoring other possibilities like continued diplomacy or sanctions.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “Truer words were never spoken” is used to shut down further analysis of Eisenhower's statement and present it as an absolute, unquestionable truth.
16. Red herring – No – The text stays focused on its central argument and does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract the reader.
17. Straw men – No – The text primarily presents its own narrative rather than misrepresenting and then refuting an opponent's argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text makes direct accusations rather than deflecting criticism by pointing out the supposed hypocrisy of an opponent.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It employs a vast number of propaganda techniques not as secondary elements, but as the primary foundation of its argument. The entire piece is built upon a Causal Oversimplification, attributing decades of complex political events to a single, vaguely defined "military/security complex." This central claim is supported by a constant Appeal to Fear, warning of a "dystopia," a "coup," and nuclear war. It uses Loaded Language ("presstitutes," "sedition") and Name Calling to demonize opponents, while simultaneously using an Appeal to Authority (Eisenhower) to lend itself credibility. The argument is framed as a Black & White Fallacy where the world is divided between the heroic president and the "deplorables" on one side, and the evil, all-powerful complex on the other, with no room for nuance. The sheer density and combination of these techniques indicate that the text's purpose is not to inform or engage in reasoned debate, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, conspiratorial worldview by manipulating emotions and distorting reality.
