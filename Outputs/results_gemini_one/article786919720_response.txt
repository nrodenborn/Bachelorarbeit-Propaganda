Name calling – Yes – The headline refers to Senator Feinstein as “Desperate Feinstein,” which is an insulting label.

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea or political message.

Appeal to fear – No – The text focuses more on generating anger and distrust towards political figures rather than instilling fear in the audience about a future threat.

Doubt – Yes – The text repeatedly questions the motives and credibility of Senator Feinstein, for example: "It's incredible the amount of hypocrisy Senator Dianne Feinstein puts on display for the American people to see".

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the allegation by calling it a "30-Year-Old Claim" and stating that bringing it up is "ridiculous," while exaggerating the political motivations as "political theater."

Flag-Waving – No – While it mentions "the American people," the text does not make a significant or direct appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its argument.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like “Desperate,” “hypocrisy,” and “antics” to frame the subjects in a negative light.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea should be accepted because it is popular or that "everyone" is doing it.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the reason for the allegation being brought forward to a simple partisan cause: "this is the Democrats for you," ignoring any other potential complexities or motivations.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's own writing is direct and clear in its accusations and point of view; it is not intentionally vague or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites Fox News, The Washington Post, and Senator John Cornyn to lend credibility to its narrative. Example: "Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) dismissed the controversy on Twitter."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as either a legitimate claim (which it dismisses) or a "last minute gambit" and "political theater," ignoring any other possibilities.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "this is the Democrats for you" is used to dismiss the actions of an entire political party and discourage any deeper analysis.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the completely unrelated "Vince Foster cover-up" at the end, distracting from the topic of the Kavanaugh allegation.

Straw men – No – The text primarily attacks the character and motives of individuals rather than misrepresenting and refuting a specific argument they have made.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text immediately deflects from the issue of Kavanaugh by charging Feinstein with hypocrisy: "...while at the same time remaining silent on two women who have accused Rep. Keith Ellison... of abusing them".

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It does not present a balanced view of the events but instead launches a one-sided attack on political opponents. It employs a very high number of propaganda techniques, including Name-calling, Loaded Language, and Whataboutism, to discredit individuals rather than engage with the substance of the issue. The use of logical fallacies like Red Herring and Causal Oversimplification, combined with appeals to authority that support its biased narrative, demonstrates a clear intent to manipulate the reader's opinion through emotion and rhetoric rather than to inform them through objective facts. The primary goal is persuasion and reinforcement of a partisan viewpoint, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
