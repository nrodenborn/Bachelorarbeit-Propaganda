Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "frivolous ruling" (to describe the judge's decision), "act like a child" (to describe Jim Acosta).
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – "Don't call on Jim Acosta another time for as long as he remains in the White House Press. Make him regret it the entire time he is there." functions as a directive slogan.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "just how dangerous a precedent this sets" (fear of the consequences of the ruling).
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "he should be impeached" (casting doubt on the judge's competence/credibility), "how little those who represent us know of our Constitution" (doubt about officials' understanding).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "nothing but surreal", "such a ridiculous demand" (exaggerating the nature of the ruling/submission), "simple human decency" (minimizing the issue of conduct as purely obvious manners).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – "For any constitutionalist", "how little those who represent us know of our Constitution", "unconstitutional rulings" (appeals to patriotism/loyalty to the Constitution).
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "surreal", "frivolous", "dangerous precedent", "simple human decency", "proper manner", "ridiculous demand", "testimony to how little", "unprofessional behavior", "should know better", "way downhill". (Emotionally charged words throughout).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association with universally hated groups like Nazis is made.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "we believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference" (implying the preferred norms are the popular choice).
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The complex situation (court ruling, press conduct) isn't reduced to a single, simple cause. Multiple factors are implied (Acosta's behavior, CNN's position, the judge's ruling).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is highly opinionated but relatively clear in its assertions and criticisms. The rules presented are explicit.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No external authority figure (expert, leader, institution) is cited to support the claims. The arguments are based on the author's opinion and interpretation.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – The poll presents only "Yes" or "No" options for whether Acosta should get his pass back, ignoring nuances like "with conditions" or "after an apology". The text implies the ruling was either completely correct or completely frivolous/unconstitutional.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – While strongly opinionated, the text doesn't use phrases specifically designed to shut down critical thinking (e.g., "it is what it is", "America: love it or leave it").
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Focusing extensively on "how Jim Acosta treated both Sarah Sanders, President Donald Trump and a White House aide" distracts from the core legal/constitutional issue of the press pass revocation and the court's ruling on due process.
17. **Straw men** – No – The author criticizes the actual ruling and Acosta's actual behavior (as perceived by the author), not misrepresented versions of opponents' arguments.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The author does not accuse opponents (Judge Kelly, CNN, Acosta) of hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated wrongs by others.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques. It heavily relies on **Loaded Language** and **Name Calling** ("frivolous ruling," "act like a child") to frame the judge, Jim Acosta, and the situation negatively. It uses **Repetition** (the poll question), **Appeal to Fear** ("dangerous precedent"), **Doubt** (on the judge and officials), **Exaggeration** ("surreal," "ridiculous"), and **Flag-Waving** (invoking the Constitution) to persuade. It employs the **Black & White Fallacy** in the poll and presents a **Red Herring** by focusing on Acosta's alleged behavior to distract from the legal basis of the ruling. It also uses **Bandwagon** (implying most journalists agree with the WH) and ends with a directive **Slogan**. The overall purpose is not to provide a balanced analysis of the press rules or the court case, but to vehemently criticize the judge, Acosta, and the White House's compliance, while promoting a specific, highly partisan viewpoint using emotionally manipulative and persuasive tactics. While it presents factual information (the new rules, Sanders' quotes), the framing, selection, and language used are overwhelmingly propagandistic.
