12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are specific (e.g., case numbers, locations, timelines).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Quotes WHO officials (Peter Salama, Tedros) and cites WHO actions to validate the severity.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dilemmas (e.g., "only two options") are presented.

---

**Verdict – 10% –** The text is primarily factual reporting, citing specific data (32 cases, 18 deaths), geographical details, and expert sources (WHO, scientists). While it highlights alarming possibilities (e.g., urban spread), this reflects legitimate public health concerns rather than overt manipulation. Minimal propaganda elements are present: the "worst-case scenario" framing (Appeal to Fear) and WHO quotes (Appeal to Authority) subtly emphasize urgency but do not distort facts. The absence of loaded language, exaggeration, or partisan agendas supports its credibility. Propaganda likelihood is low, as the piece aims to inform, not persuade ideologically.
