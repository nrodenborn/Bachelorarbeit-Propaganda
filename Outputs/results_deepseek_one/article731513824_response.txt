Based on the definitions provided and the text analysis, here is the evaluation for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to the subjects (the diocese, priests, or homosexual couples). Terms like "moral turmoil" describe a situation but aren't personal insults.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message (blessings for gay couples happening/reported) is consistent, but it's not repeated excessively or mechanically. The text presents information and quotes.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as rallying cries within the text (e.g., no equivalent to "BUILD THE WALL"). Phrases like "God is love" are theological statements, not slogans in this context.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text reports criticism and concern ("moral turmoil", "provoked concern and criticism"), but it does not actively try to instill fear in the reader about the consequences of blessing gay couples or *not* blessing them. It presents opposing views factually.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text reports statements and events without overtly questioning the credibility of the diocese, the priests involved, or the sources quoted (like Kath.net or von Gersdorff). It presents them as factual reports or opinions.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The reporting appears factual. Descriptions like "enormous power" or "high value" are direct quotes from participants, not the article's own language. The scale of the practice (e.g., 50 couples over 15 years) is reported without obvious inflation or downplaying.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There are no appeals to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty (like "We the People") to bolster the argument. The focus is on Church teaching and practice.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – The text uses language with strong negative connotations when describing the events from the perspective of critics: "moral turmoil", "controversy", "provoked concern and criticism". The phrase "Queer Church Services" in quotes could also be seen as loaded depending on the audience, though it's presented descriptively. Terms like "clear signal" and "openness" used by supporters have positive connotations, showing the text presents both sides with potentially loaded terms.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – There are no comparisons made to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally hated groups to discredit the practice of blessing gay couples.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – While the text mentions similar practices or considerations in Germany ("Similar blessings... currently taking place, or are being considered"), it does not use this to pressure the reader into accepting the idea *because* it's becoming popular. It's presented as contextual information.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text doesn't oversimplify the causes of the debate or the practice. It references complex factors like debates among German bishops, interpretations of *Amoris Laetitia*, and local pastoral initiatives.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is generally clear and specific. It names dioceses (Linz, Limburg, Aachen, Paderborn), priests (Harant, Lehner, Simonsen, Modenbach), documents (*Amoris Laetitia*), groups (dahop, Rainbow Pastoral), and events (specific blessings, Bishops' Conference meeting).
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Supporters of the blessings explicitly use appeals to authority: Father Harant references Pope Francis and *Amoris Laetitia* (AL 250) to justify the practice ("He sees himself in this in union with Pope Francis..."). Cardinal Marx's views are also cited as supportive authority.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents the complexity of the debate. It mentions supporters, critics (Bishop Laun, von Gersdorff), and the nuanced position of the German Bishops' Conference needing to address it. Von Gersdorff presents a potential binary *outcome* for the bishops ("forbid" or "essentially accept"), but this is his analysis of their upcoming decision, not the article presenting the *entire issue* as only having two sides.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Supporters use phrases that could shut down theological discussion: "We have nothing to forbid", "God is love. There are no restrictions." These phrases, while theological, are presented as definitive reasons justifying the practice without engaging counter-arguments about sacramental theology or Church doctrine on marriage.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the topic of blessings for homosexual couples within the Catholic Church in Austria and Germany. There are no significant irrelevant distractions introduced.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text reports the actual arguments of the supporters (welcome, God's love, reference to AL) and the critics (concern, upholding Church teaching, need for clarity). It doesn't misrepresent or refute a weaker version of an opposing argument.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge any opponent (e.g., critics of the blessings) with hypocrisy regarding their own past actions or beliefs to deflect from the main issue.

**Verdict – 10% –** While the text originates from a source (LifeSiteNews) with a clear editorial stance opposing such blessings and uses some **Loaded Language** (e.g., "moral turmoil", "controversy") and reports the use of **Appeal to Authority** and **Thought-terminating clichés** by supporters, the article itself functions primarily as a *report* on an event and the surrounding debate. It presents facts (the invitations, the quotes from involved priests/pastoral workers, the existence of the Dahop group, similar cases in Germany), quotes from supporters *and* critics (von Gersdorff, reference to Bishop Laun), and context (references to German debates, the Bishops' Conference). The low percentage reflects the presence of a few techniques used *by the subjects quoted* and minor loaded language by the *reporter*, but the core of the text is informational reporting on a controversial development within the Church, not a piece constructed primarily to propagate a specific ideology using manipulative techniques. The dominant mode is descriptive journalism, albeit from a perspective critical of the developments described.
