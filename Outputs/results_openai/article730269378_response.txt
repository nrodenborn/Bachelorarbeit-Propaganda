Verdict – 40% – The text exhibits some elements of propaganda, particularly through the use of doubt, loaded language, and obfuscation. These techniques are used to question the credibility of law enforcement and to imply racial assumptions, which can influence the audience's perception. However, the text does not employ a wide range of propaganda techniques, and the presence of these elements alone does not strongly suggest a high likelihood of the text being propaganda.
