Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "Obama Judge" (used in the headline and later text). This is an insulting label implying bias based on who appointed her.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" (repeated three times consecutively in the poll question).
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrase used as a rallying cry within the news report itself. ("The fix is in" and "They stole Arizona" are closer to loaded language/exaggeration within commentary).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "They stole Arizona" and "One down three to go" imply a coordinated theft of elections, instilling fear about the integrity of the electoral process.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "Who didn't see this coming?" and "The fix is in" cast immediate doubt on the legitimacy and impartiality of the judge's ruling.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "They stole Arizona" (a strong, unproven claim about election theft). Minimization: Describing the lawsuit's claims about vulnerabilities and disenfranchisement without necessarily endorsing them, while emphasizing the judge's Obama appointment.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeal to patriotism or national/group identity as a primary argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – "stole" (Arizona), "disenfranchise", "disturbed", "blasted", "scheme" (provisional ballot scheme). These words carry strong negative connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – "Obama Judge" is used to disapprove of the ruling by associating the judge with former President Obama, who is polarizing for the likely intended audience.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "One down three to go" implies momentum and encourages joining the implied perspective that elections are being stolen one state at a time.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text reports complex election procedures and a lawsuit without explicitly attributing the situation to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text reports specific rulings, deadlines, vote counts, and lawsuit claims relatively clearly.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – While figures like Cortes are quoted, their statements are presented as information, not as the primary *evidence* to support the core claims of bias or theft.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents multiple perspectives (Kemp's claims, Abrams' stance, the lawsuit arguments, the judge's ruling) without explicitly reducing the situation to only two stark choices.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "The fix is in" and "Who didn't see this coming?" are phrases used to dismiss the judge's ruling as inherently corrupt without engaging with its substance.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The entire section about the Jim Acosta poll ("Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?") is completely irrelevant to the story about the Georgia election ruling and lawsuit. It distracts from the main topic.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text reports arguments actually made (Kemp's declaration, Abrams' refusal to concede, the lawsuit claims) without misrepresenting a specific opposing argument to refute it.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge an opponent with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated actions.

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements, primarily concentrated in the introductory commentary ("Who didn't see this coming? The fix is in. They stole Arizona. One down three to go.") and the headline ("Obama Judge"). These sections use multiple techniques (Name Calling, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Reduction ad Hitlerum, Bandwagon, Loaded Language, Thought-terminating clichés) to frame the judge's ruling as inherently biased and part of a pattern of election theft, appealing directly to the emotions and preconceptions of a specific audience. The inclusion of the irrelevant Jim Acosta poll is a clear Red Herring distraction. However, the bulk of the text (approximately 80%) functions as a relatively standard, albeit selectively framed, news report detailing the ruling, the lawsuit claims, Kemp's position, Abrams' stance, and relevant statistics. While this factual reporting section uses some Loaded Language favoring the lawsuit's perspective, it lacks the concentrated barrage of manipulative techniques seen in the opening. The propagandistic framing at the beginning significantly influences the interpretation of the subsequent factual information, warranting a high likelihood (70%) that the text as a whole functions as propaganda.
