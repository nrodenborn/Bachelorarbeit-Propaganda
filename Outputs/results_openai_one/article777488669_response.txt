Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, flag-waving, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, and straw men. These techniques are used to persuade the audience of the divine and historical legitimacy of the death penalty, often by appealing to religious identity and authority. The text's heavy reliance on religious doctrine and authority figures, combined with its dismissal of modern objections as deviations from tradition, suggests a strong likelihood of being propaganda aimed at reinforcing traditional Catholic views on capital punishment.
