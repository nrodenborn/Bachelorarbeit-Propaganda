Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against the subjects (McGill, the report, Lew, Democratize SSMU, Jewish groups). The text reports accusations (e.g., "whitewash," "flawed") but attributes them to sources.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message (report finding no anti-Semitism, Jewish groups disagreeing) is stated clearly but not excessively repeated throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans to promote a specific viewpoint within the text itself. Terms like "BDS" are named movements, not slogans created by the text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – While the text discusses concerns about anti-Semitism and safety, it reports these concerns from sources (Lew, Jewish groups) rather than using fear to support a specific idea itself. The principal's statement ("no place for anti-Semitism... feel safe") aims to reassure, not instill fear.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The Jewish groups explicitly question the report's credibility and accuracy: "the report fundamentally misunderstands this, which alters the entire findings of the report," "report does not present a full or accurate picture," "Boudreau was mistaken about the timing."
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – The text reports claims from both sides (report says no anti-Semitism, groups say there was/is) without obvious textual exaggeration or minimization of the events or claims. It presents the findings and criticisms directly.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – There are no appeals to patriotism, nationalism, or broad group identity within the text itself to bolster an argument.
8.  **Loaded Language** – No – The language is largely neutral and reportorial. Terms like "whitewash," "outcry," "controversy," and "hostile atmosphere" are attributed to sources or describe reactions, not used by the text itself to evoke strong emotions or stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No argument or idea is disapproved of by associating it with universally hated groups (e.g., Nazis).
10. **Bandwagon** – No – There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea to convince the reader within the text. References to groups (e.g., five Jewish groups, B'nai Brith) represent stakeholders, not an appeal to popularity.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text presents complexity. The report attributes the vote to politics (support for Israel/Zionism/anti-BDS views), while Jewish groups attribute it to anti-Semitism fueled by prior rhetoric. The text doesn't oversimplify the cause itself.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is clear and specific about the events, the report's findings, and the criticisms raised. Key details (vote count, dates, group names, specific messages) are provided.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Both sides use appeals to authority: The report relies on the authority of the investigator (Boudreau) and the Principal (Fortier) commissioning it. The Jewish groups cite their own organizational authority (Hillel, Chabad, B'nai Brith) and the authority of the anti-Semitic message's existence/timing to counter the report.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents multiple perspectives and nuances. The report distinguishes between anti-Israel protest and anti-Semitism, Lew's belief is called "honest and even understandable," and the controversy's roots in the BDS debate are explained. It doesn't force a simple binary choice on the reader.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used that would inherently shut down critical thought. Arguments and counter-arguments are presented for consideration.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the core issue: the vote against Lew, the report's findings, and the criticisms of that report. No irrelevant material is introduced to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – Arguments are represented fairly. The Jewish groups directly counter the report's specific findings and reasoning (especially regarding the timing and impact of the anti-Semitic message). The report is presented as concluding the vote was political, not that anti-Semitism doesn't exist on campus.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No participant in the reported events charges an opponent with hypocrisy as a diversionary tactic within the scope of this text.

**Verdict – 15% – Explanation:**
The text is primarily a **news report** summarizing a controversial university investigation and the reactions to it. Its main function is to inform, presenting facts (the vote, the report's conclusion, the restoration of Lew), key findings from the report, and specific criticisms from identifiable Jewish groups. While the *subject matter* involves accusations and counter-accusations where propaganda techniques (like Doubt and Appeal to Authority) are *used by the sources quoted* (the Jewish groups and the report/investigator respectively), the **text itself** does not predominantly employ these techniques to manipulate the reader towards a specific conclusion. It maintains a relatively neutral tone, attributes claims clearly, and presents multiple viewpoints. The low percentage (15%) acknowledges the presence of techniques within the *quoted statements* (e.g., Doubt cast by Jewish groups, Appeal to Authority by both sides) which are inherent to the controversy being reported, but the overall text structure and presentation lean towards factual reporting rather than overt propaganda. The reader is given information from various angles to form their own opinion.
