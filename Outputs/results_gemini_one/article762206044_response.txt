1. Name calling – Yes – The text repeatedly refers to Imran Awan as a "Muslim IT spy," which is an insulting label that combines his religion with an accusation of espionage.
2. Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times consecutively.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases as a rallying cry.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states the story implicates Democrats in "what could be the biggest crime of spying in US history," which is intended to instill fear about national security.
5. Doubt – Yes – The opening sentence, "One of the biggest stories of 2017 and 2018 is being ignored by the mainstream media and we all know why that is," is designed to cast doubt on the credibility and motives of the media.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The phrase "what could be the biggest crime of spying in US history" is an extreme exaggeration of the potential scope and impact of the alleged events.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The reference to "the biggest crime of spying in US history" appeals to a sense of patriotism and the importance of protecting the United States from internal threats.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses phrases like "aided & abetted," "frantic, not normal," and "Muslim IT spy" to evoke strong negative emotions and stereotypes.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The phrase "we all know why that is" implies that this knowledge is a commonly held belief that the reader should also accept to be part of the informed group.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text does not present a simple cause for a complex event; rather, it builds a complex conspiracy narrative.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The phrase "what could be the biggest crime" is intentionally vague, allowing the author to make a dramatic claim without having to prove it as a certainty.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article heavily cites and quotes "Luke Rosiak of The Daily Caller," presenting him and his publication as an authoritative source for the information.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The poll, "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?", presents only the option of choosing which Democrat is the most corrupt, thereby creating a false dichotomy where the only possibility is Democratic corruption.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "we all know why that is" serves to shut down critical thinking by suggesting the reason is obvious and not up for discussion.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is inserted in the middle of the text, serving as an irrelevant distraction that engages the reader in an exercise to reinforce the article's bias rather than follow the evidence being presented.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text presents Wasserman Schultz's statement about "due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling" and then refutes it by saying she was defending someone suspected of cybersecurity violations, misrepresenting her argument about legal procedure as an argument denying any wrongdoing.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not attempt to excuse or deflect an accusation by charging an opponent with hypocrisy on another matter.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. It employs a vast majority of the listed techniques to construct a one-sided narrative designed to persuade the reader rather than inform them. The piece relies heavily on emotionally loaded language (Name calling, Loaded Language), logical fallacies (Black & white fallacy, Straw men), and techniques that manipulate the reader's perception of reality (Appeal to fear, Exaggeration, Doubt). Its primary goal is not to present a balanced account of events but to stoke outrage and confirm a pre-existing bias against the Democratic Party and a specific politician. The framing of the story, the selective use of information, and the constant appeal to emotion over reason confirm its nature as propaganda.
