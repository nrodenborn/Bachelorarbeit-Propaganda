Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Kritarch Patti Saris" (used repeatedly). The term "Kritarch" is an insulting label implying she illegitimately rules like a judge in ancient Israel, attacking her authority.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – While "Kritarch" and "illegal aliens" are used multiple times, the core message isn't repeated verbatim in a way that fits the definition.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – There are no brief, memorable phrases used as slogans (e.g., "Build the Wall").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **No** – The text doesn't primarily try to instill fear about alternatives to support its main idea (deportation). It focuses on criticizing the judge and the immigrants.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – "though she seems confused as to who will do the reviewing"; "Saris appears to be making up immigration law and procedure on the fly"; questioning her understanding of EOIR process and law; "This makes no sense in English".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Multiple instances:
    *   *Exaggeration:* "Kritarch Patti Saris thinks she runs immigration policy"; "she has gone full rogue"; "Saris wants these illegals to never leave"; describing the asylum process as "liberal" and "credulous"; "Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty".
    *   *Minimization:* Describing the Indonesian violence as "limited in time and duration"; implying the asylum seekers weren't genuine refugees because they were "relatively wealthy" and used visas "in a leisurely manner"; "87 IQ is just about retarded" (minimizing/dehumanizing Indonesians).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – "the immigration laws of the United States"; "make American immigration policy"; "build the wall, and deport illegals here"; "due process that Congress gave"; framing the judge's actions as usurping national sovereignty and law.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Extensive use: "Kritarch", "credulous 'judges'", "Obama Regime", "Administrative Amnesty", "illegal aliens" (used repeatedly), "dull lot", "dull Indonesians", "retarded", "full rogue", "making up immigration law", "illegals". These terms evoke strong negative emotions and stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparison to Nazis or Hitler-associated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – The text doesn't appeal to the popularity of the idea of deporting these immigrants.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – The text doesn't present a simple cause for a complex event in the way defined.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is highly opinionated but generally clear in its accusations and claims, not deliberately obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – While citing a Reuters article, the text doesn't use an authority figure's support as evidence for its *own* arguments; it uses the quote to establish the judge's action factually before criticizing it.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – "Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts." This presents only two rigid options (executive branch OR courts) as the sole possibilities for authority, ignoring potential nuances like judicial review of due process.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – No phrases like "it is what it is" or "that's just common sense" used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – The extensive discussion about Indonesian IQ scores ("87 IQ", "dull lot", "retarded", "high IQ elite") is irrelevant to the legal arguments about asylum claims, deportation orders, judicial authority, or changed country conditions. It serves to distract by denigrating the immigrants' country of origin and implying superiority/deservedness of the Chinese immigrants based on IQ.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – "Basically Saris wants these illegals to never leave." This misrepresents the judge's order (which was to *delay* deportation to allow a *chance* to argue changed conditions) as a desire for them to stay permanently without consequence.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not charge a specific opponent with hypocrisy on a related issue.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It heavily relies on multiple core propaganda techniques: **Name Calling** ("Kritarch"), **Loaded Language** ("illegal aliens," "Obama Regime," "credulous 'judges'", "retarded"), **Doubt** (questioning the judge's competence and understanding), **Flag-Waving** (appealing to US law/nationalism), **Exaggeration/Minimization** (describing the judge's actions as "running immigration policy," "full rogue," "making up law"; minimizing the persecution and describing Indonesians as "dull" and "retarded"), **Black & White Fallacy** (executive branch vs. courts), **Red Herring** (the irrelevant IQ argument), and **Straw Men** (claiming the judge wants illegals to "never leave"). The core purpose is not balanced reporting or legal analysis, but to vilify a judge, delegitimize a group of immigrants and their asylum claims, promote a specific anti-immigration agenda ("build the wall, and deport illegals"), and discredit a previous administration, using emotionally charged, prejudiced, and manipulative language throughout. The inclusion of the scientifically dubious and racially charged IQ argument is a particularly strong indicator of propagandistic intent. While it references a factual event (the judge's order), the framing, language, and argumentation are designed to persuade through emotional manipulation and distortion rather than objective reasoning.
