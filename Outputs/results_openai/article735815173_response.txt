Verdict – 75% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, reduction ad Hitlerum, black & white fallacy, and whataboutism. These techniques aim to shape the reader's perception of Rep. Danny Davis, Louis Farrakhan, and the organizations involved, suggesting a high likelihood that the text is intended as propaganda. However, the absence of some techniques and the presence of factual reporting prevent it from being classified as pure propaganda.
