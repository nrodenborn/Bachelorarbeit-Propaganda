**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict – 80% –**  
The text exhibits multiple propaganda techniques, including doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, obfuscation/intentional vagueness, and appeal to authority. The primary aim appears to be undermining the credibility of the official narrative and fostering skepticism toward law enforcement and mainstream media. The use of emotionally charged language, vague assertions, and selective appeals to alternative authorities are classic markers of propaganda. However, the text does not employ all possible techniques, and some elements (such as the inclusion of factual timeline details) provide a veneer of reporting. Nonetheless, the overall structure and language strongly suggest an intent to persuade the audience toward a particular skeptical or conspiratorial viewpoint, rather than to inform objectively.
