Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Examples: "neo-Catholics" (used pejoratively), "homosexual predator" (for McCarrick), "pro-homosexual prelates", "shifty polemicists" (for Shea), "architects of ruin".  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Repeated emphasis on "homosexual infiltration," cover-ups by Bergoglio, and calls for resignation (e.g., "Bergoglio must resign" appears multiple times).  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases designed for mass appeal.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Warnings of the Church being "disfigured," "strangled," and destroyed by internal corruption and "homosexual networks" (e.g., "strangling the entire Church").  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions credibility of critics (e.g., dismissing Faggioli's analysis as "propaganda," accusing Winters/Allen/Shea of smearing Viganò without evidence).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: "homosexual infiltration... emerges mountainously"; Minimization: Downplays counter-evidence (e.g., dismissing Bergoglio's silence as self-incrimination).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Appeals to Catholic identity/tradition against "Novus Ordo" reforms (e.g., "integral Tradition," "Church of old").  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotional/derogatory terms: "debauchery," "subversion," "cover-up," "pervert," "disaster," "ruinous reforms," "smear."  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Cites growing support for Viganò (e.g., bishops endorsing him, Laura Ingraham/Voris demanding resignation) to pressure conformity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Blames Vatican II and "homosexual infiltration" as sole causes of abuse crisis (e.g., "launched its installation" of decline).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are direct, not deliberately obscure.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Relies on Viganò’s testimony as an "insider" and cited bishops (e.g., Strickland, Schneider) to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents only two options: Resignation of Bergoglio/prelates **or** continued corruption (e.g., "final collapse" vs. "restoration").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Phrases like "indisputable truth," "simply the truth," and "mythical Middle Ages" (to dismiss traditionalism) end debate.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Diverts to Fatima prophecy (e.g., "The Fatima Connection") to imply cosmic stakes unrelated to abuse allegations.  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Misrepresents Faggioli’s position (e.g., claims he defends "homosexual status quo" when Faggioli acknowledges clergy homosexuality as a problem needing nuanced address).  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – No deflection via accusations of hypocrisy.

**Verdict – 85% – Explanation**  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs **13 confirmed techniques** (with 3 borderline/absent) to advance a polemical agenda:  
1. **Agenda-Driven Narrative**: It frames complex Church issues (abuse scandals, theological disputes) as a binary battle between "neo-traditionalist" truth and corrupt "Novus Ordo" establishment, ignoring nuance.  
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language, fear appeals, and name-calling dominate (e.g., "wolves tear apart sheep," "parasite in the Body of Christ").  
3. **Selective Evidence**: Cites Viganò and sympathetic bishops as absolute authorities while dismissing critics as smears ("shifty polemicists"). Contradictory evidence (e.g., Bergoglio’s silence framed as guilt) is minimized.  
4. **Oversimplification**: Reduces the abuse crisis to "homosexual infiltration" and Vatican II reforms, ignoring broader systemic factors.  
5. **Call to Action**: Demands resignations and a return to "integral Tradition," positioning itself as a moral crusade.  
While based on real events (McCarrick scandal, Viganò’s testimony), the text’s one-sided rhetoric, demonization of opponents, and lack of balanced analysis align it strongly with propaganda. The 15% non-propaganda reflects factual citations (e.g., Viganò’s allegations, bishops’ statements) embedded within the persuasive framework.
