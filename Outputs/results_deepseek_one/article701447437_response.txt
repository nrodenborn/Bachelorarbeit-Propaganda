Here's the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – No. The text does not use insulting labels against the subjects (the ritual, the locals, the government).
2.  **Repetition** – No. The ritual is described multiple times, but the *exact same phrase or message* is not repeated incessantly.
3.  **Slogans** – No. There are no brief, memorable phrases used as slogans (e.g., "Stop Famadihana!" isn't present).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes**. The text vividly describes the plague ("AIRBORNE", "killed at least 124 people", "black death") and directly links the deadly risk to the ritual ("anyone coming close to the corpse... could themselves, catch the infection", "bacteria can still be transmitted"). This instills fear to discourage participation in the ritual. Example: "The plague that’s airborne and has killed at least 124 people...", "anyone coming close to the corpse... could themselves, catch the infection."
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes**. Locals are quoted doubting the government's motives and the existence/severity of the plague. Example: "The plague is a lie", "Josephine Ralisiarisoa firmly believes the country’s cash-strapped government is just exaggerating the problem to get money".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Possible, but weak**. "AIRBORNE" in the headline is technically accurate for pneumonic plague but presented dramatically. Minimization occurs in the locals' quotes downplaying the risk ("I’ve never caught the plague"). Strongest example of minimization: "The plague is a lie".
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No. There are no appeals to patriotism or national/group identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes**. The phrase "Dancing With Corpses" in the headline and repeated descriptions evoke strong negative emotions (disgust, horror, revulsion) towards the ritual. Example: "‘Dancing With Corpses’", "dance with them through the streets", "dance around the bodies".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No. No comparison to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No. There is no appeal based on the popularity of an idea or action.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes**. The text strongly implies the ritual ("dancing with corpses") is the *primary* or *major* cause ("one of the major causes") of the outbreak's spread, potentially oversimplifying a complex epidemiological situation involving other transmission vectors (person-to-person airborne transmission being the primary one for pneumonic plague). Example: "The local tradition is said to be one of the major causes of the spread of this disease", linking the outbreak timing directly to the ritual season.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No. The text is relatively clear in its descriptions of the ritual, the disease, and the conflicting viewpoints.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes**. The text cites Willy Randriamarotia (health ministry chief of staff) and health officials to support the danger of the ritual. Example: "Willy Randriamarotia, Madagascar’s health ministry chief of staff [said] 'the bacteria can still be transmitted...'", "health officials have even warned tourists...".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No. The text presents the conflict (health risk vs. tradition) but doesn't frame it as only two extreme choices with no middle ground.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No. No phrases like "it is what it is" or "trust the plan" are used to shut down discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No. The discussion stays focused on the ritual, the plague, and the government's actions/motives. No irrelevant topics are introduced.
17. **Straw men** – No. The arguments presented (officials: ritual is dangerous; locals: plague is exaggerated/conspiracy) are represented directly through quotes. No misrepresentation is evident.
18. **Whataboutism** – No. No charges of hypocrisy are made by comparing the actions of one group to another unrelated action.

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits several hallmarks of propaganda: it uses **Loaded Language** ("Dancing With Corpses") to evoke strong negative emotions towards the cultural ritual, employs **Appeal to Fear** by emphasizing the deadliness and airborne nature of the plague linked directly to the ritual, engages in **Causal Oversimplification** by heavily implying the ritual is a major cause of the outbreak's spread, and includes **Doubt** cast by locals on the government's motives and the plague's severity. While it presents opposing viewpoints (locals defending the ritual) and cites **Appeal to Authority** (health officials), the overall framing, sensational headline, and selective emphasis lean towards persuading the reader to view the ritual as dangerous and irrational, potentially at the expense of a more nuanced understanding of the cultural context and the complex epidemiology of the plague. The presentation prioritizes shock value and a specific narrative over purely objective reporting. However, the inclusion of direct quotes from officials and locals prevents it from being purely one-sided propaganda, hence the 70% likelihood.
