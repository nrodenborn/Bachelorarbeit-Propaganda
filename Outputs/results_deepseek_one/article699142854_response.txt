2. **Repetition** – No – No significant repeated phrases; arguments develop progressively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL"); language is descriptive.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – Warnings about Iran’s threats are contextual, not manipulative fear-mongering (e.g., "menace to the US" is analytical).  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Questions Obama’s legitimacy: "Obama backed the murderous regime... spurning millions of Iranians" and implies Corker ignored "constitutional duty."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Minimizes opposing views: "mendacious assumptions of Obama’s Iran policy" dismisses alternative perspectives as deceitful.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No overt patriotism (e.g., "We the People"); focuses on policy, not national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Emotionally charged terms: "murderous regime," "hostile actions," "menace," "aggression" frame Iran negatively.

10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeals to popularity; relies on policy arguments.

12. **Obfuscation** – No – Clear arguments; no deliberate vagueness.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No cited experts; uses factual references (e.g., embassy seizure) without authoritative endorsement.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Presents nuanced options (e.g., amended deal vs. broader strategy).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – Encourages debate: "substantive debates on Iran."  
16. **Red herring** – No – Stays focused on Iran policy; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Accurately represents Obama’s policy (e.g., engagement with Iran as "responsible actor").

### Verdict – 35% –  
**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits elements of propaganda (e.g., **loaded language**, **doubt**, and **minimization** of opposing views), primarily through its biased framing of Iran as inherently hostile and its dismissal of Obama’s policies as "mendacious." However, it largely avoids overt manipulative techniques like fear appeals or slogans. Instead, it presents a structured policy analysis:  
- **Non-propaganda aspects:** Detailed examination of Trump’s speech, congressional dynamics, and strategic risks; acknowledgment of complexities (e.g., limitations of an "improved deal").  
- **Propaganda aspects:** Selective emphasis on Iran’s aggression while downplaying diplomatic alternatives, emotionally charged terms ("murderous regime"), and partisan skepticism toward Democrats/Corker.  
The piece functions as **opinion journalism** advocating a hardline Iran policy, using occasional propagandistic language to persuade rather than relying predominantly on deception or oversimplification. Its reliance on factual events (e.g., embassy seizure) grounds it in reality, but its persistent negative framing of Iran and political opponents nudges it toward low-grade propaganda.
