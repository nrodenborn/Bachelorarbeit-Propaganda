Here is the analysis of the text against the provided propaganda techniques:

1.  **Name calling** – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack any subject or object.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The phrase "no one is safe" is repeated multiple times ("no one is safe", "meaning no one is safe", "no one in Madagascar is safe").
3.  **Slogans** – No – While "no one is safe" is repeated, it functions more as a stark warning than a brief, memorable phrase designed for rallying or branding (like a political slogan).
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text repeatedly emphasizes the danger, spread, deadliness ("Death often occurs within 12-24 hours"), and unprecedented nature ("much more dangerous", "never been so prevalent", "much more contagious") of the plague, explicitly stating "no one is safe" to instill fear about the outbreak.
5.  **Doubt** – No – The text does not specifically question the credibility of any person, organization, or information source. It reports warnings and statements as facts from authorities.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No (Definite Exaggeration not present) – While alarming, the descriptions ("much more dangerous", "no one is safe", statistics) are presented as statements from officials and experts reporting on an unusual outbreak. There's no clear evidence *within the text* that these claims are exaggerated beyond what the sources stated. Minimization is not present.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national/group identity to promote an idea or action.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words and phrases like "black plague" (evoking historical pandemics), "no one is safe", "high alert", "much more dangerous", "deadly", "most life-threatening", "spiking concerns", and "global pandemic" are emotionally charged and evoke fear and urgency.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – The text does not attempt to disapprove of an idea by associating it with hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – No – The text does not appeal to the popularity of an idea or action to encourage adoption.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text describes the complexity of the outbreak (different strains, transmission methods, spread from rural to urban, need for long-term help) without attributing it to a single, overly simplistic cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text provides specific details (number of deaths, cases, regions affected, types of plague, transmission methods, incubation time, expert names and titles, organizations involved). The language is clear and specific.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – The text frequently cites officials and experts to support its claims: "doctors are warning", "Health officials say", "experts are warning", "Elhadj As Sy, the secretary general... said", "Dr. Manitra Rakotoarivony... said", "Jimmy Whitworth, professor... told".
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text does not present only two extreme choices or options. It describes a complex, evolving situation.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – The text does not use phrases designed to shut down critical thinking (e.g., "it is what it is", "trust the plan"). The repeated "no one is safe" is alarming but functions more as a warning than a cliché meant to end discussion.
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the plague outbreak in Madagascar, its dangers, spread, and response. It does not introduce irrelevant topics to distract.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that wasn't actually made.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge opponents with hypocrisy by referencing unrelated wrongdoings.

**Verdict – 25% –** The text primarily functions as alarming health reporting on a developing outbreak, citing multiple authorities and providing specific, factual details (statistics, transmission methods, expert statements, response measures). However, it employs several techniques commonly associated with propaganda: **Repetition** (of "no one is safe"), **Appeal to fear** (emphasizing extreme danger and widespread risk), **Loaded Language** (using emotionally charged terms like "black plague" and "no one is safe"), and **Appeal to authority** (relying heavily on expert quotes). These techniques heighten the sense of urgency and danger, potentially bordering on sensationalism, but the core information appears grounded in reported facts from credible sources. The overall intent seems more informational and cautionary than deliberately manipulative towards a specific ideology or political agenda, hence the low percentage.
