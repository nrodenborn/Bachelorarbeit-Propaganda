1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Mike Pompeo as a "former top spook," which is an informal and slightly derogatory label for a high-ranking intelligence official.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly links the new appointees (Pompeo and Haspel) to the policies of previous administrations (Clinton, Bush, Obama) to reinforce the idea that this is not a positive change. For example: "If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, you’ll like Pompeo’s," and "Bottom line, George W. Bush/Barack Obama era foreign policy and intelligence doctrines aren’t going anywhere under Trump."
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests negative future outcomes, such as a "Russian proxy war" and a continuation of "Obama-era, world-on-fire... shenanigans," to create apprehension about the new appointments.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text raises questions about the implications of the appointments, stating, "The move creates some big questions about both the administration’s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president’s relationship with the deep state."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses phrases like "Obama-era, world-on-fire" to exaggerate the negative consequences of past policies, implying these will continue under Pompeo.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism; if anything, it is critical of U.S. foreign policy and intelligence agencies.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like "top spook," "deep state," "world-on-fire," "shenanigans," and "big fan of torture" to influence the reader's perception.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular or that the reader should agree because many others do.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The concluding sentence, "Bottom line, George W. Bush/Barack Obama era foreign policy and intelligence doctrines aren’t going anywhere under Trump," simplifies a complex political and personnel change into a single, definitive outcome.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct in its criticism and its message is clear, even if it uses loaded terms. It does not appear to be intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites external sources like "a 2013 Washington Post article," "The Intercept," "The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on torture," and "commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane" to lend credibility to its claims about Gina Haspel.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a continuation of disliked past policies versus a desired (but now lost) alternative. The statement "If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, you’ll like Pompeo’s" presents his appointment as being identical to Clinton's tenure, ignoring any other possibilities or nuances.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; instead, it actively tries to persuade the reader to adopt its critical viewpoint.
16. Red herring – No – All the information presented, while framed in a biased way, is directly related to the topic of the new appointees and their backgrounds.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text constructs a straw man by equating Mike Pompeo's future tenure with Hillary Clinton's past tenure ("If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, you’ll like Pompeo’s"). It then attacks this constructed equivalence rather than engaging with the specific nuances of Pompeo's own record or potential policies.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing others of hypocrisy; it maintains a direct focus on criticizing the new appointees.

Verdict – 95% – The text is not a neutral report of a staff change but a persuasive piece designed to cast the appointments in a negative light. Its primary goal is to convince the reader that these changes represent a continuation of policies associated with the "deep state" and previous administrations (Clinton, Obama, Bush), which the target audience presumably opposes. It achieves this through a heavy use of propaganda techniques, including loaded language ("top spook," "world-on-fire," "shenanigans"), appeal to fear (warning of a "Russian proxy war"), and a black & white fallacy that repeatedly and simplistically equates the appointees with disliked figures like Hillary Clinton. The final sentence ("Bottom line...") is a clear example of causal oversimplification, reducing a complex event to a single, negative conclusion. While it uses factual reporting (citing the Washington Post and Senate reports) as a foundation, the framing, word choice, and logical fallacies are all geared towards manipulating the reader's emotional response and promoting a specific political viewpoint, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
