Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Pope Francis as a "lunatic" who "drives the sheep off a cliff" and an "abusive stepfather". It also calls Walter Kasper a "celebrity heretic," the episcopate a "scandalous pack of frauds," and various bishops "wolves in shepherds’ clothing."

Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly asks why Pope Benedict resigned and why he remains silent in the face of the current pontificate, framing these questions as a central, unanswered mystery that proves its thesis. The idea that Benedict was never a true conservative but a "progressive" is also introduced and then reiterated with historical claims.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses short, memorable, and emotionally charged phrases that function like slogans to encapsulate its arguments, such as calling the Vatican a "den of thieves" and referring to bishops as "wolves in shepherds’ clothing".

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates a sense of crisis and fear by describing the current state of the Church as a "monstrous debacle," a "purge of faithful, believing Catholic... has begun," and a situation where a "lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff," implying a disastrous future for Catholics.

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is built around casting doubt on the character, motives, and orthodoxy of Pope Benedict XVI. It explicitly asks, “Could we have been wrong about him? And if so, could we have been this wrong?” and questions the authenticity of a letter attributed to him: “Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not...”.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the perceived negative aspects of the current pontificate, calling it the "worst papacy of all time" and claiming "Error, even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor." It also minimizes Benedict's stated reasons for resigning as "trivial, so inappropriately, so disproportionately petty."

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific Catholic identity, contrasting the "Catholic faithful" and the "ancient Faith" against a "New Paradigm" and "progressives." It rallies readers who identify as traditional or orthodox Catholics against a perceived internal enemy.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as "commedia diabolica" (diabolical comedy), "maudlin drivel," "poisoned cake," and describing the situation as a "monstrous debacle."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party to discredit its opponents.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. In fact, it frames its perspective as a difficult truth that "most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud."

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex situation in the modern Catholic Church by attributing it almost entirely to a single event and a single person's character: "And through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time".

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – While direct in its accusations, the text uses vagueness and unanswered rhetorical questions to imply a deeper conspiracy without providing concrete evidence. Phrases like “something doesn’t add up, it’s true” and questions like “Who is the real Joseph Ratzinger?” create suspicion through insinuation rather than fact.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text selectively cites figures who support its narrative, such as Steve Skojec of "One Peter Five" and quotes from Cardinal Henri de Lubac and Ross Douthat to lend credibility to its claims about Ratzinger's past and the current crisis.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark dichotomy between the true "ancient Faith" and the "New Paradigm" of post-conciliar Catholicism. It argues that one cannot be both a "conservative Catholic" and a "liberal Catholic," framing it as a choice between true Catholicism and a "monstrous fraud."

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases that present a conclusion as self-evident and not open to discussion. For example, when discussing Walter Kasper, it states, “But it’s a simple truth: he’s a heretic. Everyone knows he’s a heretic…” which serves to shut down any nuanced debate on the matter.

Red herring – No – The text stays focused on its central argument: attacking the character and legacy of Pope Benedict XVI. The historical details provided, while selective, are used directly to support this central thesis rather than to distract from it.

Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents or oversimplifies opposing viewpoints to make them easier to attack. For instance, it refutes the idea that Benedict is being held against his will by sarcastically noting, “We have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat,” which is a caricature of the actual concerns expressed by some.

Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges Benedict XVI with hypocrisy. For example, it questions how the “arch-conservative” “Rottweiler” Ratzinger could have presided over the CDF while neo-modernism spread unchecked: “With the “arch-conservative” “Rottweiler” Ratzinger in CDF, why do we have the situation we have today?” This points out a perceived hypocrisy between his reputation and his actions (or inaction).

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform or engage in balanced analysis, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative, and conspiratorial viewpoint regarding Pope Benedict XVI, Pope Francis, and the Catholic Church since the Second Vatican Council.

The article systematically employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. It relies heavily on emotional manipulation through **Loaded Language** ("monstrous fraud," "poisoned cake"), **Name Calling** ("lunatic," "wolves"), and **Appeals to Fear** (a "purge" is coming). The entire piece is an exercise in creating **Doubt** about a public figure's character and motives.

Furthermore, it builds its case on logical fallacies, most notably **Causal Oversimplification** (blaming the Church's complex situation on Benedict's single act of resignation) and the **Black & White Fallacy** (pitting the "ancient Faith" against a "New Paradigm" with no middle ground). It uses **Selective Appeal to Authority** by quoting only those who agree with its premise while dismissing or ignoring contradictory sources.

The text constructs a narrative of betrayal and conspiracy, framing it for a specific in-group of "faithful" Catholics (**Flag-Waving**) who are being told a difficult truth others are afraid to voice. The sheer density and combination of these techniques demonstrate that the author's intent is to construct and reinforce a particular ideology by discrediting its targets through emotional and rhetorical means, rather than through objective, evidence-based argumentation.
