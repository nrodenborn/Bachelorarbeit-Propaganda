Based on the definitions provided and the text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Labels the official narrative as "complete nonsense" and implies authorities are involved in a "widespread cover-up".
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The core claim of "multiple shooters" is repeated throughout the text ("multiple active shooters," "multiple shooters were used," "active shooters on the runway," "presence of multiple shooters").
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "active shooters on the runway" (directly quoted and highlighted in the tweet) functions as a brief, memorable phrase encapsulating the core claim.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text instills fear by suggesting a massive government cover-up of the "worst mass shooting in American history," implying authorities are hiding dangerous truths and that a witness died shortly after speaking out.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text consistently questions the credibility of the official narrative ("directly contradicts the official story," "proof that the entire narrative... is complete nonsense," "authorities are actually actively covering up," "American people are clearly not being told the truth").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses strong, exaggerated language like "bombshell," "striking example," "widespread cover-up," "stunning," "complete nonsense," "countless stories." Minimizes the official account by dismissing it as nonsense and a cover-up.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to American identity and patriotism by framing the event as the "worst mass shooting in American history" and emphasizing that "the American people are clearly not being told the truth."
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged language throughout: "bombshell," "striking," "widespread cover-up," "worst," "massacre," "stunning," "complete nonsense," "fateful night," "false flag," "astonishingly vivid," "shockingly," "clearly not being told the truth."
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not attempt to link the official narrative or authorities to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to the popularity of the alternative narrative by referencing "countless stories," a "now viral article," and "dozens of eyewitness reports" to support the claim of multiple shooters.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Simplifies the complex event by implying the existence of the air traffic audio *alone* is "further proof" of multiple shooters and a cover-up, ignoring other evidence and investigations.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses vague terms like "countless stories," "government officials and private companies that *may* be behind the attack," and "no official denial" (without specifying who should deny or what exactly they should deny). The nature of the supposed cover-up remains undefined.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Cites Mike Tokes (releasing the audio) and Shepard Ambellas (reporting on the witness) as sources validating the alternative narrative. Also implies the air traffic controller's statement is authoritative proof.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents the situation as only two possibilities: either the official lone gunman story is true (dismissed as "nonsense" and a "cover-up") or the alternative narrative of multiple shooters and a government conspiracy is true.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses phrases like "complete nonsense," "authorities are actually actively covering up," and "American people are clearly not being told the truth" to shut down critical examination of the official account.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: Introduces the death of Kymberley Suchomel shortly after posting her account, implying foul play ("died shortly after," "reports are claiming are natural causes"), which is emotionally charged but irrelevant to directly proving the core claim of multiple shooters or a cover-up. It distracts towards a conspiracy theory about witness silencing.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text attacks the actual official narrative (lone gunman, Stephen Paddock acting alone). It doesn't misrepresent that specific position.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not accuse proponents of the official narrative of hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated wrongs they committed.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text exhibits a very high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is not to neutrally report facts but to aggressively promote a specific, conspiracy-laden alternative narrative about the Las Vegas shooting, directly challenging the official account. It achieves this through:
*   **Repetition & Slogans:** Hammering the "multiple shooters" claim.
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** Loaded language, appeal to fear (cover-up, witness death), and flag-waving.
*   **Undermining Credibility:** Constant doubt, name-calling ("cover-up," "nonsense"), and thought-terminating clichés against the official story.
*   **Creating False Support:** Bandwagon appeals and appeals to questionable authorities.
*   **Oversimplification & Distraction:** Causal oversimplification and red herrings (witness death).
*   **False Dichotomy:** Black & white fallacy forcing a choice between the official "lie" and the promoted conspiracy.
*   **Vagueness:** Failing to concretely define the alleged cover-up or conspirators.
The overwhelming use of these techniques strongly indicates the text's primary function is persuasive propaganda aimed at discrediting an official investigation and promoting a specific ideological viewpoint.
