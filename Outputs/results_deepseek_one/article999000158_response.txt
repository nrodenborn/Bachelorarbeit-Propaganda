Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "pathological liar and accused woman abuser Keith Ellison" uses insulting labels to attack Ellison.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: The poll question "Should military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants..." is repeated verbatim three times.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No distinct, brief, memorable phrase is used as a slogan throughout the text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: "a man who has called on 10,000 blacks to stalk and murder white people" instills fear about Farrakhan (and by association, Ellison).
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Yeah, right, Hakim!" and "Keith, you're lying" explicitly question Ellison's credibility and truthfulness.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Calling Ellison a "totalitarian-minded individual" exaggerates his political stance; describing Farrakhan's views as merely "absolutely incompatible" (via Ellison) is minimized by the author as a lie.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: There is no direct appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Numerous emotionally charged phrases are used, including "pathological liar," "accused woman abuser," "seeks to deceive you," "totalitarian-minded," "flea-infested political con man," and "Both of these men have the same devil as their father".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparison is made to Hitler, Nazis, or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: There is no appeal to the popularity of an idea or action.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: No complex event is attributed to a single, simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is direct and accusatory, not vague or obscure.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text cites Michael Ahrens' tweet ("In 1993, Farrakhan told women...") and presents it as evidence against Ellison.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text presents Ellison and Farrakhan as sharing the same evil essence ("Both of these men have the same devil as their father") and implies Ellison is fundamentally deceptive like Obama ("Maybe Ellison is attempting to pull an Obama").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: The cliché "If you lie down with dogs, you're going to get fleas" is used to shut down critical analysis of Ellison's associations.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: The repeated poll question about using military force against migrants ("Should military force be used to stop the caravan...") is completely irrelevant to the main topic of Ellison and Farrakhan, serving only to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text attacks Ellison's actual statements and documented actions (like the 2013 dinner), rather than misrepresenting his position.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Explanation: Introducing Obama's situation with Jeremiah Wright ("Remember when Obama's 'pastor,' Jeremiah Wright uttered 'God damn, America!'?") charges Ellison with hypocrisy by comparing him to another Democrat accused of downplaying associations.

**Verdict – 95% –** The text is overwhelmingly likely to be propaganda. It heavily relies on emotional manipulation through **Name Calling**, **Loaded Language**, and **Appeal to Fear**. It actively undermines its subject's credibility using **Doubt** and **Appeal to Authority** (Ahrens' tweet). It employs logical fallacies like the **Black & White Fallacy** and **Whataboutism** (Obama comparison) to discredit Ellison. The inclusion of an irrelevant **Red Herring** (the migrant poll) distracts from the core issue. **Repetition** of the poll and **Thought-terminating Clichés** ("lie down with dogs...") further discourage critical analysis. While presenting factual events (e.g., the 2013 dinner, Farrakhan's quotes), the text's primary purpose is not balanced reporting but rather a vehement, one-sided attack designed to demonize Keith Ellison and his association with Louis Farrakhan, using a barrage of recognized propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. The lack of substantive counter-argument or context for Ellison's statements confirms its propagandistic nature.
