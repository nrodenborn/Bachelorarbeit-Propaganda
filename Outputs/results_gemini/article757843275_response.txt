1. Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack a person, group, or idea. Terms like "experimental" are descriptive, not insults.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the word "experimental" to describe the vaccine and the drug ZMapp. Example: “EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered…”, “An experimental Ebola vaccine is being rolled out…”, “it appears their only solution is an experimental vaccine.”, “An experimental vaccine is one that has never been tried on humans before.”
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text graphically describes the symptoms and fatality rate of Ebola to instill fear. Example: “It begins with flu-like symptoms, followed by bloody diarrhea and vomiting. Days later, some victims begin bleeding through the nose, mouth, and eyes. Depending on the strain of the Ebola virus, it can kill up to 90% of victims.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility and effectiveness of the official response and the vaccine itself. Example: “The World Health Organization has been warning about the “Ebola situation” in Congo, and it appears their only solution is an experimental vaccine.” and “For their sake, let’s hope it works better than this year’s flu vaccine.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the risk of the virus spreading to create doubt about the necessity of an experimental vaccine. Example: “Since the virus is spread through direct contact, an isn’t airborne, it isn’t nearly as deadly as it could be.”
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses words with strong emotional connotations to influence the audience. Example: “terrifying,” “feared,” “suffering,” and the repeated use of “experimental” to evoke a sense of danger and uncertainty.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not associate the idea of vaccination with any group hated by the audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that the vaccine is popular or that everyone is supporting it. In fact, it does the opposite by highlighting its experimental nature.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text offers a simplistic explanation for a complex biological process. Example: “Meaning, the virus itself doesn’t actually kill. The immune system’s response to the virus is what’s deadly.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The text uses vague phrasing to cast doubt on the actions of authorities. Example: “it appears their only solution is an experimental vaccine.” This is presented as a conclusion without providing evidence that no other solutions were considered.
13. Appeal to authority – No – While the text quotes authorities like the WHO and the Minister of Health, it does so to question their actions or frame them in a negative light, rather than using their authority as evidence to support its own argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a choice between a terrifying disease and a risky, unproven vaccine, ignoring other possibilities like containment, supportive care, or other potential treatments. Example: “So, is the Ebola virus reaching a terrifying enough level that an experimental vaccine is warranted?”
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down critical thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces an irrelevant point to distract and create a final sense of doubt. Example: “For their sake, let’s hope it works better than this year’s flu vaccine.” The effectiveness of the annual flu vaccine has no bearing on this specific Ebola vaccine.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that was not being made.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not directly accuse an opponent of hypocrisy to deflect criticism.

Verdict – 85% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. While it is structured like a news article and contains factual information and quotes from official sources, it uses these elements as a vehicle for a persuasive agenda. The primary goal is not to inform objectively, but to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt regarding the experimental vaccine and the public health authorities administering it. This is achieved through the heavy use of multiple propaganda techniques, including loaded language (constantly repeating "experimental"), appealing to fear with graphic descriptions of the disease, casting doubt on the WHO's competence, and using a red herring (the flu vaccine comparison) to leave the reader with a final, unrelated sense of distrust in vaccination. The veneer of journalistic reporting makes the propaganda more subtle and potentially more effective than a more overt piece.
