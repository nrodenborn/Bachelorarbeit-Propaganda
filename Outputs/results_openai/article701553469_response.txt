Verdict – 85% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, causal oversimplification, black & white fallacy, and whataboutism. These techniques are used to present a one-sided narrative that emphasizes antisemitism and bias against Jewish students while minimizing or ignoring other potential factors or perspectives. The use of emotionally charged language and repeated emphasis on a perceived threat contributes to the likelihood that the text is propaganda.
