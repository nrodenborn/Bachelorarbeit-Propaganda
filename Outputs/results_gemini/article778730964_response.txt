1. Name calling – Yes – The author labels the imam's statement as "'war is deceit' action" and dismisses him with the label "Ever the victim."
2. Repetition – Yes – The question "Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?" is repeated three times.
3. Slogans – Yes – The phrase "Ever the victim" is used as a brief, memorable, and dismissive phrase to characterize the imam's position.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states as a fact that the imam's son "was training school shooters," a claim designed to evoke fear and discredit any alternative perspective.
5. Doubt – Yes – The author explicitly questions the imam's credibility by stating he is "engaging in some 'war is deceit' action" and sarcastically dismissing his claims about journalists.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author minimizes the imam's entire viewpoint by reducing it to the simple, dismissive phrase "Ever the victim."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The author appeals to an in-group identity by creating a conflict between "us" ("those whom they smear as 'anti-Muslim'") and "them" (the "establishment media" and the imam).
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as "smear," "'war is deceit' action," "jihad activity," and "Ever the victim."
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular; in fact, it positions itself against the "establishment media."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The author simplifies the imam's motives to a single cause: engaging in "'war is deceit' action" because of his religion, ignoring any other potential complexities.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's viewpoint is stated directly and is not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The author does not use the support of an authority as evidence for his own claims; he instead critiques the media and the imam.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two possibilities: the author's narrative of jihadist activity is true, or the imam's claim of "anti-Muslim propaganda" is true, leaving no room for nuance or alternative explanations.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase "Ever the victim" is used to shut down any meaningful consideration of the imam's perspective.
16. Red herring – Yes – The poll about Brett Kavanaugh is completely irrelevant to the article's topic and serves as a distraction.
17. Straw men – Yes – The author presents the imam's argument as a simplistic claim that "it’s all because of journalists who supposedly hate Islam and Muslims," which is an oversimplification that is easier to refute.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text opens by charging the media with hypocrisy, stating that the AP gives the imam a platform but never allows "us to tell our side of the story."

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and overt piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, negative viewpoint. This is achieved through the heavy use of numerous propaganda techniques. The author's commentary frames the subsequent AP news report, telling the reader how to interpret the facts before they are even presented. It employs loaded, emotional language ("jihad activity," "war is deceit") and name-calling ("Ever the victim") to discredit the subject. It uses whataboutism and appeals to an in-group identity to create an "us vs. them" narrative against the "establishment media." Furthermore, the inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Kavanaugh poll) demonstrates that the piece is not a work of journalism but rather content designed to engage a specific ideological base and reinforce a particular worldview. The sheer density and combination of these techniques confirm its nature as propaganda.
