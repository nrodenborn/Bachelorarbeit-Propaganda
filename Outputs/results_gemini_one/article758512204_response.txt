Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text uses insulting labels to attack the subjects, such as calling the IT aides “Muslim spies” and “jihad spies.”

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear by describing the situation as the “biggest story of treason and espionage in the recent memory” and referring to the aides as “jihad spies,” suggesting a grave threat to national security.

Doubt – Yes – The text casts doubt on the credibility of the mainstream media by stating, “for month after month the media has refused to cover it.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the scale and certainty of the events, calling it “the biggest story of treason and espionage in the recent memory.”

Flag-Waving – No – While the text deals with national politics, it does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or use national symbols to make its case.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged and stereotypical language, such as “hellbent on destroying President Trump,” “Soviet fictions,” “titillating porn stories,” and “jihad spies.”

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or the Nazis to discredit them.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that the reader should agree with an idea because it is popular or that "everyone" is doing it.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a complex cybersecurity and criminal investigation as a simple case of “Democrat leadership collusion with Muslim spies,” which is an oversimplified cause for the described events.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; it makes very direct and specific accusations, even if they are unsubstantiated.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the “Daily Caller News Foundation” and concludes with an endorsement of “Pamela Geller's commitment to freedom” to lend credibility to the article for its intended audience.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a binary conflict: the media is either covering this story or they are part of a conspiracy to destroy President Trump (“Instead, they’re so hellbent on destroying President Trump...”).

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion; instead, it uses inflammatory language to provoke a strong reaction.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the media’s alleged focus on “Soviet fictions and titillating porn stories” as a distraction from the main topic, serving to discredit the media rather than address the specifics of the Awan case.

Straw men – Yes – The text attacks the media for focusing on “Soviet fictions and titillating porn stories,” misrepresenting the entirety of their news coverage as a way to avoid covering the Awan story, thereby refuting a distorted version of their journalistic priorities.

Whataboutism – No – The text focuses on direct accusations against the subjects and does not attempt to deflect criticism by pointing out the hypocrisy of an opponent on an unrelated issue.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly an example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly negative viewpoint by employing a wide array of manipulative techniques. The article is saturated with loaded language (“jihad spies,” “hellbent”), name-calling, and appeals to fear (“treason and espionage”) to create an immediate emotional and hostile reaction towards the subjects. It uses exaggeration to frame the story as a crisis of monumental proportions and causal oversimplification to lay the blame squarely on a single political party. Furthermore, it actively works to discredit any opposing or alternative sources of information by casting doubt on the media and using red herrings and straw man arguments against them. The use of repetition in the poll and the appeal to the authority of its own publisher further cement its goal of reinforcing a specific narrative rather than engaging in objective reporting. The sheer density and variety of these techniques indicate a deliberate effort to manipulate the reader's perception.
