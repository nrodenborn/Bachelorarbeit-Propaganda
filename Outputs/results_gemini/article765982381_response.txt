Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

1.  Name calling – Yes – The text quotes John Pilger labeling journalists who fail to support Assange as “Vichy journalists — after the Vichy government that served ad enabled the German occupation of France.”
2.  Repetition – No – While the text has a central theme, it does not repeat the same specific message or phrase over and over.
3.  Slogans – Yes – The text uses phrases like “Long live the Fifth Estate!” and quotes “You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free” to create memorable and impactful statements.
4.  Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests that if WikiLeaks had not existed, events like 9/11 might not have been averted, instilling fear about the consequences of not having such an outlet: “If WikiLeaks had been up and running before 9/11 — frustrated FBI investigators might have chosen to leak information that their superiors bottled up, perhaps averting the terrorism attacks.”
5.  Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the U.S. government by stating they will “manufacture a reason to put him on trial” and the media by referring to “the silence of what used to be the noble profession of journalism.”
6.  Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text minimizes the legal case against Assange by stating his only “crime” is publishing documents, and exaggerates the importance of WikiLeaks by quoting John Pilger: “No investigative journalism in my lifetime can equal the importance of what WikiLeaks has done.”
7.  Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by describing the source of the “Collateral Murder” video as “far more a patriot than the ‘mainstream’ journalist embedded in that same Army unit.”
8.  Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “scurrilous slander campaign,” “criminal activities and corruption,” “unseemly sycophancy,” and “rapacious power” to evoke strong emotional responses.
9.  Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not associate any opposing idea with a hated group like the Nazis. It does the reverse, associating its subject (Assange) with a revered figure (Mindszenty).
10. Bandwagon – No – The text argues the opposite, suggesting that supporting Assange is an unpopular but correct position, citing that only a “few journalists to speak out on Julian Assange’s behalf.”
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies the complex legal and political situation surrounding Assange by stating his confinement is “All for spreading unwelcome truth around.”
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and clear in its arguments and who it supports and condemns. It is not intentionally vague or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the support of authorities like journalist John Pilger, Nobel laureate Harold Pinter, and the organization Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity to bolster its argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a choice between supporting Assange as a truth-teller or being a complicit “Vichy journalist.” It frames the situation as a struggle between truth (WikiLeaks) and suppression (governments/media), ignoring nuance.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the phrase “You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free” to shut down debate by framing the issue in simple, absolute moral terms.
16. Red herring – Yes – The extensive and detailed comparison to Cardinal Mindszenty, while emotionally powerful, introduces a historical situation with a very different context to distract from the specific legal and political details of Assange’s case and frame it simply as a case of a righteous man versus an oppressive state.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the argument that Assange is a criminal by framing the case against him as being solely about him spreading “unwelcome truth.” This ignores and misrepresents the specific legal arguments made by his opponents (e.g., regarding the Espionage Act or endangering sources) and instead attacks a weaker, simplified version of their position.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text charges the “civilized world” with hypocrisy by contrasting its praise for Mindszenty with its condemnation of Assange: “Decades ago, the U.S. and ‘civilized world’ had nothing but high praise for the courageous Mindszenty... And Assange?”

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It is not a balanced or objective piece of journalism but a persuasive editorial designed to manipulate the reader's emotions and opinions in favor of Julian Assange. The author employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal.

The entire piece is framed by a powerful but flawed analogy (a Red Herring) to Cardinal Mindszenty, a revered anti-fascist and anti-communist figure. This comparison is an Appeal to Authority that immediately positions Assange as a martyr. The text is saturated with Loaded Language ("scurrilous slander," "rapacious power") and uses Name-Calling ("Vichy journalists") to demonize opponents. It presents a stark Black & White Fallacy where one is either a supporter of truth and freedom with Assange or a complicit sycophant of a corrupt establishment.

Furthermore, it relies on Causal Oversimplification, reducing a complex international legal case to simply being punished for "spreading unwelcome truth," which is a Straw Man argument against the actual legal charges. The heavy use of Appeals to Authority (Pilger, Pinter, etc.) and Whataboutism (pointing out the West's hypocrisy) serves to reinforce its one-sided narrative. The sheer number and combination of these techniques demonstrate a clear intent to persuade through emotional manipulation and logical fallacies rather than a balanced presentation of facts, making it a clear example of propaganda.
