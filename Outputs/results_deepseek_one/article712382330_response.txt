Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of the text for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses "tyrannical and unprincipled papacy" to attack Pope Francis's leadership and "Dictator Pope" as an insulting label for the book title.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: No specific phrase or message is repeated insistently throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable, rallying phrases are used (e.g., no equivalent to "BUILD THE WALL").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Warns of catastrophic consequences like the Church losing its head ("the Mystical Body would then be without its head") and the promotion of heresy/sacrilege as magisterial to instill fear about the Pope's actions and their implications.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Repeatedly questions the credibility and legitimacy of Pope Francis and his magisterium (e.g., "tyrannical and unprincipled papacy", "counter-magisterial", implying he might profess heresy, calling Cardinal O'Connor's statement "a gross understatement").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Exaggerates the negative impact of Pope Francis's papacy ("Four years of Bergoglio would be enough to change things... this might have been a gross understatement") and minimizes the legitimacy of his official acts by labeling them "counter-magisterial" or potentially heretical.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: While appealing to Catholic identity and doctrine, it does not primarily use appeals to patriotism or broad group identity in the manner defined (like "We the People").
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged and negative terms like "heresy", "sacrilege", "tyrannical", "unprincipled", "Dictator Pope", "adulterers", "mortal sin", "adulturous couples", "adulturous state", "dissenting left", "irreversible winter" (in the example quote within the definition list, though used contextually here) to evoke strong disapproval.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No attempt is made to link the Pope's actions or supporters to Nazis or other universally hated groups.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: Does not appeal to the popularity of the position it argues for.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The complex theological and ecclesiastical issues are presented as multifaceted (involving documents, interpretations, authority), not reduced to a single simple cause.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is direct and clear in its criticism and presentation of events/quotes; it does not rely on deliberately obscure language to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Cites St. Thomas Aquinas ("a subject ought to rebuke his prelate [pope] even publicly"), Cardinal Burke, and canonist Franz Wernz ("a [publicly] heretical Roman Pontiff loses his power") as authorities to support the argument against the Pope's actions and legitimacy.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents the situation as starkly binary: either the Pope's teaching is accepted as magisterial (bad/heretical) or it must be resisted and refuted (good/orthodox). It frames accepting the teaching as leading to the Church losing its head.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: Does not employ phrases designed to shut down critical thinking (e.g., no equivalent to "It is what it is" or "Trust the plan" in this context).
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: The text stays focused on the theological controversy surrounding Amoris Laetitia, communion for remarried divorcees, and the Pope's authority. It does not introduce significantly irrelevant material to distract.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: Criticizes the Pope's actual position (as presented in the documents and rescript) and potential future actions (declaring ex-cathedra), rather than refuting a misrepresented or weaker version of his arguments.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: Does not accuse Pope Francis or his supporters of hypocrisy by pointing to their past actions or statements on unrelated matters.

**Verdict – 85% –** Explanation: The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques, particularly **Loaded Language**, **Appeal to Fear**, **Doubt**, **Exaggeration/Minimization**, **Appeal to Authority**, **Name Calling**, and **Black & White Fallacy**. Its primary purpose is not neutral reporting but to aggressively persuade the reader that Pope Francis is promoting heresy, acting tyrannically, and potentially jeopardizing the very leadership of the Church. It selectively uses quotes from authorities (Aquinas, Burke, Wernz) to bolster this argument, employs highly charged negative terminology ("heresy," "sacrilege," "tyrannical," "Dictator Pope," "adulterers"), exaggerates the impact of his papacy, frames the issue in starkly binary terms (accept heresy vs. resist), and consistently casts doubt on the Pope's legitimacy and motives. While it presents factual elements (documents, quotes, events), the overall presentation is heavily slanted, emotionally manipulative, and designed to delegitimize the Pope and his teaching, meeting the core characteristics of propaganda. The 15% uncertainty acknowledges the presence of factual reporting about the documents and events, though presented within the highly biased framework.
