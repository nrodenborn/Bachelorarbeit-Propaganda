Below is the analysis of the propaganda techniques present in the text, followed by the verdict:

### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: Labels opposing views as "new man-centered conciliar religion" and "materialistic thinking," implying they are corrupted or inferior.  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: Repeats the phrase "instituted by God Himself" and variations (e.g., "God instituted it," "divine decree") to reinforce divine authority for capital punishment.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases are used as rallying cries (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL!" is absent). The title is descriptive, not slogan-like.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Warns that abandoning the death penalty leads to societal decay (e.g., rising murder rates) and spiritual peril (e.g., neglect of "expiation due to God").  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: Questions modern Catholics' credibility (e.g., "growing numbers of Catholics actually consider it immoral") and implies they deviate from true doctrine.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – Explanation: No clear overstatement/understatement; statistics are presented neutrally, and theological claims are asserted as fact.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: Appeals to Catholic identity/tradition (e.g., "age-old doctrine of the Church," "Christian societies," "Christendom") to validate the death penalty.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Uses emotionally charged terms like "materialistic thinking," "spiritual welfare," "ignominious death," and "New Pentecost" (mocking conciliar reforms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups; critiques focus on theological errors.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: Does not appeal to popularity; instead, laments modern trends (e.g., declining executions as a deviation).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: Attributes rising murder rates solely to declining executions (e.g., "decline in the exercise of the death penalty has kept close pace with decline in the Faith").  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: Arguments are explicit (e.g., direct scriptural citations, clear theological reasoning).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Relies on Scripture, Pope Pius XII, St. Paul, and Pope Leo XIII as irrefutable sources (e.g., "Pope Leo XIII re-affirmed this truth...").  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents only two options: accept the death penalty as divine law or embrace "man-centered" heresy (e.g., modern views ignore "God’s standpoint").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: No phrases like "it is what it is"; instead, invites theological engagement.  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: Stays focused on theological/scriptural arguments; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: Accurately summarizes opposing views (e.g., rehabilitation focus, deterrence critiques) before refuting them.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: Does not accuse opponents of hypocrisy; critiques their logic, not their actions.

### Verict – 95% – Explanation:  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It selectively uses Scripture and tradition to argue for the divine sanctity of capital punishment while dismissing opposing views as "materialistic," "man-centered," or doctrinally corrupt. Multiple techniques are employed: **appeal to fear** (societal collapse without executions), **loaded language** (e.g., "New Pentecost" used derisively), **black-and-white framing** (tradition vs. modern heresy), **repetition** of divine authority, and **causal oversimplification** (linking murder rates to declining faith). Though structured as theological discourse, its goal is persuasive: to delegitimize contemporary Catholic critiques of capital punishment and frame dissent as a betrayal of "true" doctrine. The 5% uncertainty arises from its scholarly tone and scriptural citations, which superficially resemble neutral exegesis—yet these elements serve the core agenda of reinforcing a specific, immutable viewpoint.
