Verdict – 70% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, including repetition, doubt, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, causal oversimplification, black & white fallacy, red herring, and whataboutism. These techniques are used to shape the reader's perception of President Trump's actions and the failures of the Obama administration, suggesting a significant likelihood that the text is propaganda. However, not all techniques are present, and some arguments are presented with factual claims, which slightly reduces the overall likelihood.
