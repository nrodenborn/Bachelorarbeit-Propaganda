1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes President Trump describing the migrant caravan as an “assault” and an “onslaught,” which are insulting labels for a group of people.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeats the threat to cut off foreign aid to Central American countries, mentioning it once in the third paragraph and again in the sixth paragraph.
3. Slogans – Yes – The text quotes the brief and memorable phrase, “CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!”, which functions as a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text supports the idea of closing the border by instilling fear, describing the caravan as an “assault” and an “onslaught” that requires mobilizing the “U.S. military.”
5. Doubt – Yes – The text quotes Trump questioning the ability of Central American countries to manage their citizens (“seem to have almost no control over their population”) and questioning the motives of his political opponents (“Democrats are backing the human movement”).
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Describing a caravan of 4,000 people, which includes women and children, as an “assault” or an “onslaught” that requires military intervention is an exaggeration of the threat.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a threat to the “nation” and its sovereignty, necessitating the use of the “U.S. Military” to “CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!”.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like “assault,” “onslaught,” and “stanch the inflow” to evoke strong negative emotions about the migrants.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not compare any person or idea to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest an idea is popular and that the reader should join in.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text quotes Trump claiming that Democrats are backing the caravan to support “open borders,” which is a simple political cause for the complex socio-economic event of mass migration.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The claim from Congressman Matt Gaetz that “video footage shows Honduran women and children were being given cash to join the caravan” is intentionally vague, lacking specifics about who is providing the money or the source of the footage.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the authority of a “Congressman” to lend credibility to the claim about migrants being paid. Trump also uses his own authority as President to threaten military action.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy in Trump’s statement: “if [Mexico is] unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!”, which presents only two extreme options and ignores other diplomatic or humanitarian possibilities.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The phrase “open borders” is used as a political cliché to shut down nuanced discussion on immigration by framing the opposition with an extreme, unpopular position.
16. Red herring – Yes – The claim that “Democrats are backing the human movement” is a red herring that distracts from the humanitarian reasons for the caravan and shifts the focus to a domestic political conflict.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an argument that was not presented by claiming Democrats support “open borders.” This is a misrepresentation of the mainstream Democratic position on immigration, creating an easily attackable, false argument.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by charging an opponent with hypocrisy.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly propagandistic. While it is structured as a news report, the vast majority of its content consists of direct quotes and paraphrased statements that employ a wide range of propaganda techniques. The article heavily amplifies a specific narrative that frames a complex humanitarian issue as a malicious “assault” on the United States. This is achieved through the use of loaded and fear-inducing language (“onslaught,” “military”), causal oversimplification and red herrings (blaming Democrats), and straw man arguments (“open borders”). The text also relies on vague claims and appeals to authority to bolster its points. Although it includes minor counter-points, such as the Honduran government’s response, these are overwhelmed by the sheer volume and intensity of the propagandistic rhetoric from U.S. officials, making the overall effect of the text the dissemination of propaganda rather than neutral information.
