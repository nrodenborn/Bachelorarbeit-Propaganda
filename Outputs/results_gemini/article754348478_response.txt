1. Name calling – No – The text does not use any insulting labels to attack any person, group, or subject.
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat a specific message or phrase in a way intended to persuade; it repeats key terms like "Ebola" and "Congo" for clarity as they are the subject of the report.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to promote an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – No – While the text mentions that Ebola is a "deadly virus" and "fatal in up to 90 percent of cases," this is a factual statement to inform the reader of the disease's severity, not a tactic to support an idea by instilling fear against an alternative.
5. Doubt – No – The text does not question the credibility of any person or organization; it presents information from sources like the WHO as factual.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text provides specific data and statistics (e.g., "two cases," "17 deaths") without appearing to exaggerate or downplay the situation.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make any appeals to patriotism or national identity.
8. Loaded Language – No – The text uses descriptive words like "deadly" and "suffering," but these are factually appropriate for the context of a fatal disease outbreak and are not used to manipulate the reader's emotions toward a particular viewpoint.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not associate any idea with a hated group.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that the reader should adopt a viewpoint because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The text avoids oversimplification by stating that a team will "investigate how the outbreak first started," acknowledging the cause is not yet known.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is clear and specific, providing names, locations, and numbers to inform the reader, not confuse them.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text repeatedly cites official bodies as the source of its information, such as "Congo's government on Tuesday declared," "Congo's Health Ministry said," and "according to the World Health Organization." This is used as evidence for the facts presented in the article.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present a situation with only two choices.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases or clichés that are meant to discourage critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – All information presented in the text is relevant to the Ebola outbreak.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not create and refute a false argument. It is a report, not a debate.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not accuse any party of hypocrisy to deflect from an issue.

Verdict – 0% – The text is a factual news report intended to inform the public about a health crisis. Its structure, tone, and content are characteristic of objective journalism, not propaganda. It provides specific, verifiable details and attributes its information to credible, relevant authorities (e.g., the WHO, Congo's Health Ministry). While it technically uses "Appeal to authority," this is a fundamental practice of journalistic sourcing to establish credibility, not a fallacious tactic to manipulate the audience. The text lacks the persuasive intent, emotional manipulation, and distortion of facts that define propaganda.
