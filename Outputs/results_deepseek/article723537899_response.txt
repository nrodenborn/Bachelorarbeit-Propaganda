### Verdict – 70% – Detailed Explanation:
The text exhibits **strong propagandistic elements** (70% likelihood) due to its systematic use of loaded language, fear appeals, name-calling, and oversimplification to advance a specific political narrative. Key indicators include:  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded terms like "ruthless regime," "terror army," and "cleansing" evoke fear and moral outrage.  
- **Bias and Omission**: Selectively frames U.S. actions as illegitimate ("by what authority?") while downplaying U.S. interests and ignoring counterarguments (e.g., regional stability goals).  
- **Rhetorical Questions**: Repeatedly questions U.S. legitimacy ("Have the American people been had again?") to imply deception without evidence.  
- **Oversimplification**: Reduces complex geopolitics to a "War Party" agenda and presents outcomes in binary terms (withdrawal vs. endless war).  
- **Agenda-Driven Narrative**: Clearly advocates for U.S. disengagement by portraying involvement as futile, unauthorized, and dangerous.  

However, it **avoids outright falsehoods**, anchoring arguments in real events (e.g., Turkey-Kurd tensions, U.S. BSF plans). The 30% non-propaganda weight reflects its basis in factual events and absence of fabricated claims. Ultimately, the text’s persuasive techniques, selective framing, and emotional language align more closely with propaganda than neutral analysis.
