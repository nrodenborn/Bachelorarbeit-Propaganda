1. Name calling – Yes – The text quotes Donald Trump calling the verdict “disgraceful” and refers to Jose Ines Garcia Zarate as a “criminal alien” in the statement from Jeff Sessions.
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly refers to Zarate as an “illegal immigrant” and highlights that he was a “five-time deportee,” reinforcing his status as an outsider and criminal. The term “Kate’s Law” is also repeated.
3. Slogans – Yes – The article includes a tweet that uses the slogan “#BuildtheWall”.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Jeff Sessions’ statement, “When jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities, they put the public’s safety at risk,” is a direct appeal to fear regarding sanctuary city policies.
5. Doubt – Yes – The article casts doubt on the judicial process by stating the verdict “has shocked many” and by highlighting the defendant’s contradictory stories, for example, “He said it was wrapped in cloth... But in a police interrogation, Garcia Zarate admitted to firing the gun, saying he was aiming at a seal.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – A quoted tweet exaggerates the meaning of the verdict by stating, “The #KateSteinle verdict is an endorsement of murder.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – A quoted tweet appeals to patriotism by contrasting the rights of citizens and non-citizens: “When illegals have more rights and protection than American Citizens. This MUST STOP!!!!”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases such as “disgraceful verdict,” “criminal aliens,” and “preventable and heartbreaking death” to evoke a strong emotional response from the reader.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Hitler or the Nazis.
10. Bandwagon – Yes – The article states, “Social media erupted with outrage at the verdict (with very few – if any attempting to defend the verdict),” which encourages the reader to adopt the supposedly popular opinion of outrage.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The statement from Jeff Sessions, “San Francisco’s decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle,” attributes the complex event of Steinle's death to the single cause of a city's immigration policy.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article’s viewpoint is direct and clear; it does not use vague language to confuse the audience.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The article uses quotes from President Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Senator Jim Nielsen to lend authority and credibility to the outrage against the verdict.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – A quoted tweet from Mike Cernovich presents a false dichotomy: “There is no way to spin this, there is no defense, today the mask came off,” which dismisses any possibility of nuance or alternative interpretations of the verdict.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The inclusion of tweets with hashtags like “#KatesLaw” and “#BuildtheWall” function as clichés that are meant to end discussion and signal alignment with a political viewpoint.
16. Red herring – Yes – The article and the figures quoted within it consistently shift the focus from the legal merits of the murder trial (such as evidence of a ricochet) to the broader political issue of illegal immigration and sanctuary cities, which serves to distract from the jury's specific legal reasoning.
17. Straw men – Yes – The article frames the verdict as a demonstration that San Francisco will “shelter illegals and allow them to do as they please,” attacking this constructed argument rather than engaging with the actual evidence and legal standards the jury was required to consider for a murder conviction.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not use the technique of deflecting blame by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy for a similar offense.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propaganda. It is not a neutral report of a court verdict but a curated collection of opinions and facts designed to provoke outrage and advance a specific political agenda against illegal immigration and "sanctuary cities." The article employs a vast majority of the listed propaganda techniques, including loaded language, appeal to fear, causal oversimplification, and bandwagon. It selectively presents information, focusing almost exclusively on sources that express anger at the verdict (Trump, Jeff Sessions, outraged social media users) while giving minimal space to the defense's argument or the jury's reasoning. The framing, from the headline to the choice of quotes, is constructed to reinforce a single narrative: that the justice system failed due to lenient immigration policies, leading to the death of an American citizen.
