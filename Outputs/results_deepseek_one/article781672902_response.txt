Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Presstitute media" (used repeatedly), "the idiot Russian Atlanticist Integrationists," "whores who constitute the American print and TV media," "idiot Americans," "a proven corrupt person" (referring to Mueller), "weak and stupid AG Sessions."
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – Explanation: "military/security complex" (repeated numerous times), "Russiagate conspiracy" (repeated), "presstitute media" (repeated).
3.  **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No distinct, brief, memorable phrase is used repeatedly as a slogan within this text.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: "the danger of nuclear war is today far higher," "Russia will be destroyed," "the end of life on earth," "nuclear Armageddon." These instill fear about the consequences of not normalizing relations with Russia and the Russiagate investigation.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: "We do not know if Manafort is guilty or is simply a victim of Mueller’s frameup and an incompetent jury." (Questioning the validity of Manafort's conviction). Also implicitly questioning the credibility of the entire Russiagate investigation, Mueller, the media, and the US government.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: *Exaggeration*: "The military/security complex is large enough to be a member of the G-20 and to have its own currency and military." (Hyperbolic comparison). "Gaza Strip, the largest concentration camp ever in the world." (Strong hyperbole). *Minimization*: "Israel is of no consequence." (Downplaying Israel's military capability). "Twice the vaunted Israeli Army, capable of nothing but murdering unarmed women and children, were defeated and driven out of southern Lebanon by a few thousand Hezbollah militia." (Minimizing Israeli military capability while exaggerating Hezbollah's success).
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: "endorsement of the American people who in their distress and with the best information that they could acquire elected Donald Trump their President." (Appealing to the will/identity of "the American people"). Framing Russiagate as an attack on democracy and the elected president also appeals to national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Pervasive use of emotionally charged and derogatory terms: "orchestration," "conspiracy," "whores," "presstitutes," "frameup," "emnity," "hatred," "murdering," "exterminating," "concentration camp," "idiot," "corrupt," "stupid," "cowardly," "universally hated," "evil criminals," "systematically destroyed," "mass murder," "purhasing [purchasing] the governments," "endless lies." These appeal to strong emotions (anger, disgust, outrage) and reinforce negative stereotypes.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Gaza Strip, the largest concentration camp ever in the world." (Directly invoking the Holocaust/Nazi imagery to describe Gaza and implicitly compare Israeli actions to Nazis).
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text doesn't primarily argue that an idea should be accepted *because* it's popular. It focuses on conspiracy, corruption, and danger.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Trump recognized that the extreme Russiaphobia... was a threat to life on earth." (Oversimplifies the cause of a potential nuclear threat primarily to Russophobia, ignoring other complex geopolitical factors). "If Trump is defeated... It will be the end of life on earth." (Oversimplifies the cause of nuclear war to Trump's removal).
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is generally direct and uses strong, specific (though often loaded) language. It doesn't rely on deliberately unclear or obscure expressions to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Citing "Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz" to explain Mueller's tactics with Manafort and lend credibility to the author's interpretation of events.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: Presents the conflict as solely between Trump (and the truth/American people) vs. the "military/security complex," Democratic Party, and "presstitute media" who are engaged in a conspiracy to overthrow democracy. Ignores nuances, other perspectives, or motivations. Also: "The US military/security complex will not permit any normalization of relations with Russia. Period." (Presents no alternative possibility).
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: While the text uses strong language and labels, it doesn't employ common clichés specifically designed to shut down critical thought (e.g., "it is what it is," "trust the plan"). Its arguments, though biased, are elaborated upon.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: The extensive discussion of Israel/Palestine ("Gaza Strip... concentration camp," "murdering unarmed women and children," "exterminating the native populations") is largely irrelevant to the core argument about Russiagate and US domestic politics, serving to distract and inflame emotion against Israel and the US.
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Explanation: Portrays the Russiagate investigation *only* as a baseless conspiracy orchestrated purely to destroy Trump and preserve the military budget, ignoring the actual findings, scope, or stated rationale of the investigation (e.g., Russian interference efforts documented in the Mueller report). Refutes this extreme, simplified version. Also misrepresents media coverage of Manafort's conviction as solely vindicating Russiagate and being about forcing Trump from office via Watergate parallels.
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Instead of prosecution, Washington relied on the Federal Reserve to bail out the banks holding the misrepresented loans." (Used to deflect from the allegations against Manafort by pointing to perceived hypocrisy regarding the financial crisis). The Israel/Palestine section also functions as a large-scale whataboutism, shifting focus from US actions/politics to Israel's.

**Verdict – 95% – Explanation:** The text exhibits an overwhelming majority of the defined propaganda techniques (16 out of 18). Its core purpose is not balanced analysis but to aggressively promote a specific, highly charged narrative: that Russiagate was a deliberate conspiracy by the "military/security complex," Democratic Party, and media ("presstitutes") to overthrow President Trump and prevent US-Russia normalization, driven by institutional self-interest and hatred, and posing an existential nuclear threat. This narrative is advanced through pervasive use of:
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** Loaded language, appeals to fear, name-calling, and reduction ad Hitlerum (Nazi comparisons) dominate the text, evoking strong feelings of anger, fear, and outrage.
*   **Simplification & Distortion:** Causal oversimplification, black-and-white fallacy, and straw man arguments reduce complex geopolitical events (US-Russia relations, Russiagate investigation, Middle East conflicts) to a simplistic battle of good (Trump, truth, American people) vs. evil (the "complex," Democrats, media).
*   **Undermining Opponents:** Constant name-calling ("presstitutes," "whores," "idiots"), doubt, and whataboutism are used to discredit institutions (media, justice system, government agencies) and individuals (Mueller, Sessions, media figures, political opponents) without substantive engagement with their arguments or findings.
*   **Conspiracy Framing:** The entire premise relies on portraying coordinated, malicious intent behind Russiagate and US foreign policy.
While the text references real events and figures, its presentation is overwhelmingly one-sided, employs demonstrably biased and inflammatory language, and utilizes nearly every technique listed to persuade the reader of its specific, conspiratorial viewpoint rather than to inform objectively. The 5% allowance acknowledges the presence of some factual elements (e.g., Manafort's charges, Cohen's plea) within the heavily propagandistic framing.
