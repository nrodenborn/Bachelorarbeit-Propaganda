### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* "paragon of political-correctness," "queen of virtue-signaling opportunism," and "mind-numbed audience" are insulting labels attacking Clinton and her supporters.  
2. **Repetition** – **No** – *Explanation:* No single phrase or idea is repeated persistently; the criticism is varied.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – *Explanation:* No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., campaign-style slogans) are used.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **No** – *Explanation:* The text does not instill fear about alternatives; it mocks Clinton but does not warn of consequences.  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* Questions Clinton’s credibility: "hypocritically toeing the progressive line" and "apparently mind-numbed audience" imply dishonesty and audience gullibility.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* Exaggerates Clinton’s comment as a "racist joke" (headline) and minimizes her context about diversity by focusing on one remark.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – *Explanation:* No appeal to patriotism or group identity beyond generic references to "conservative opponents."  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* Emotionally charged terms like "evil and awful," "hypocritically," "childish," and "howls of laughter" stoke disdain.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – *Explanation:* No linkage to Hitler or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – *Explanation:* Does not appeal to an idea’s popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – *Explanation:* No complex events reduced to simple causes.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – *Explanation:* Language is direct and inflammatory, not vague or confusing.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – *Explanation:* No authoritative figures cited as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* Presents Clinton as hypocritical without nuance (e.g., praising diversity then making a racist remark) and implies only "progressive privilege" protects her.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* Phrases like "childish, indeed" and "insulting, indeed" shut down deeper analysis of her diversity remarks.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* The Trump hypothetical ("what would have happened if Trump said it?") distracts from evaluating Clinton’s comment fairly.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – *Explanation:* Criticizes Clinton’s actual words (the "they all look alike" joke), not a misrepresented argument.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – *Explanation:* The Trump comparison ("what would have happened if Trump said it?") charges Clinton with hypocrisy to deflect from her remark.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation:  
The text is **highly likely propaganda**. It employs multiple techniques (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, doubt, red herring, whataboutism) to manipulate perception. The headline sensationalizes Clinton’s remark as a "racist joke," framing the entire piece as an attack. Language is emotionally charged ("evil," "hypocritically," "mind-numbed"), and the author selectively quotes Clinton to amplify her error while downplaying her broader message on diversity. The Trump hypothetical is a clear red herring, deflecting from Clinton’s actions by invoking partisan double standards. The piece lacks objectivity, omits context (e.g., Clinton immediately corrected Swisher’s mistake before the joke), and uses ridicule to delegitimize Clinton and her audience. Its goal is not to inform but to provoke outrage and reinforce negative preconceptions, aligning with propaganda’s function to persuade through emotional manipulation rather than evidence-based discourse. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges the factual basis of Clinton’s remark but does not outweigh the text’s manipulative intent.
