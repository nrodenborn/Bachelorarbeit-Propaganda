Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1.  **Name calling** – Yes – "pernicious campaign of hate", "toxic environment", "malevolent BDS campaign", "rancid character", "bigoted BDS provocateurs", "leftist-fascist bigotry", "vitriolic BDS campaign".
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – "BDS" is repeated constantly with negative modifiers (e.g., "pernicious campaign", "malevolent", "bigoted", "vitriolic"). "Anti-Semitic"/"antisemitism" is also repeated.
3.  **Slogans** – Yes – "Democratize SSMU" is used as a label for the opposing movement, which the text immediately attacks as "anything but democratic".
4.  **Appeal to fear** – Yes – The text repeatedly instills fear about the environment for Jewish students ("atmosphere that Jewish students... must endure", "transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws").
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – "Judging by past ‘investigations’ conducted by other schools... I am not optimistic." casts doubt on the sincerity or effectiveness of McGill's promised investigation.
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggeration: "transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws", "leftist-fascist bigotry at its worst", "beyond the pale". Minimization: Sadikov's call to violence is described as him making light of it ("misguided joke").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – Yes – Appeals to identity and solidarity with Jewish students and supporters of Israel, framing their defense against BDS as a righteous cause against bigotry and hate.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Pervasive use of emotionally charged negative language: "outrage", "humiliating reversals", "pernicious", "toxic", "malevolent", "ignominious", "blatant anti-Semitic overtones", "rancid", "vitriolic", "repulsive", "bigoted", "beyond the pale", "charade".
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – Explicitly compares the situation at McGill to "the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws".
10. **Bandwagon** – No – While mentioning outrage among watchdog groups and politicians, it doesn't primarily argue that BDS is wrong *because* it's unpopular or that supporting Israel is right *because* it's popular. The focus is on the alleged immorality and anti-Semitism of BDS.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – "The toxic environment is due almost exclusively to an active and vocal presence of BDS agitators on campus." Attributes a complex campus climate issue solely to BDS activists.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is generally direct and accusatory, not intentionally vague or obscure in its main points. The terms used, while loaded, are clear in their intended negative meaning.
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites the SSMU Judicial Board ruling against BDS and mentions the outrage of "watchdog groups and politicians" and statements by McGill's principal and SSMU president to support its narrative.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Presents the conflict as purely good (Jewish/pro-Israel students, anti-BDS stance, defenders of democracy/constitution) vs. evil (BDS activists, Democratize SSMU, characterized as hateful, bigoted, anti-Semitic, undemocratic, fascist). Nuance or legitimate debate about BDS is absent.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – Phrases like "pernicious campaign of hate", "beyond the pale", "leftist-fascist bigotry at its worst" serve to shut down critical analysis by labeling the opposition as inherently evil or unacceptable.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The detailed focus on Igor Sadikov's tweet and its consequences, while related to campus climate, distracts from the core narrative about the removal of the board members and serves primarily to further vilify BDS supporters.
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Portrays "Democratize SSMU" *solely* as a front for removing Jewish/anti-BDS students ("Its raison d'être was to seek the removal of Jewish and anti-BDS students... and place BDS back on the agenda"). This ignores any stated democratic reform goals the group might have had, refuting an argument (pure democratic reform) not necessarily presented or focusing only on the most extreme interpretation.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not defend actions by the pro-Israel side by accusing BDS of hypocrisy on unrelated matters. It focuses on attacking BDS actions directly.

**Verdict – 85% –** The text exhibits a very high concentration of propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is not to neutrally report events but to aggressively persuade the reader that the BDS movement at McGill is inherently hateful, anti-Semitic, and undemocratic. This is achieved through:
*   **Extensive Use of Loaded Language & Name-Calling:** Consistently using highly negative, emotionally charged terms to describe BDS and its supporters.
*   **Demonization:** Comparing opponents to Nazis, labeling them "fascist," "bigoted," "rancid," and attributing pure malice to their actions.
*   **Oversimplification & Black/White Framing:** Presenting a complex campus issue as a simple battle of good vs. evil, solely blaming BDS for toxicity.
*   **Appeals to Fear & Identity:** Evoking fear of anti-Semitism and Nazi-like persecution to rally support for the pro-Israel side and Jewish students.
*   **Use of Doubt & Selective Authority:** Undermining potential counter-narratives (like McGill's investigation) while citing authorities that support its view.
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** The language and framing are designed to provoke strong negative emotions (anger, fear, disgust) towards BDS rather than encourage critical analysis of the events or the arguments for and against BDS.
While the text reports on real events (the board removal, Sadikov's tweet, the investigation), the overwhelmingly biased, emotionally manipulative, and demonizing presentation marks it overwhelmingly as propaganda pushing a specific, highly negative narrative about BDS. The 15% reservation acknowledges that it reports factual occurrences, but the framing and language dominate.
