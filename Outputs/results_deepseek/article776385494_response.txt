### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:
1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used to attack subjects (e.g., no terms like "terrorist" or "traitor").  
2. **Repetition** – No – Key messages (e.g., legal battles, safety concerns) are mentioned but not excessively repeated.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed to rally support (e.g., "Make America Great Again"). Quotes like "access to firearms is a fundamental human dignity" are statements, not slogans.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – States argue blueprints could fall into "wrong hands," including "a teen to a 'lone wolf' gunman," implying uncontrolled danger. The Brady Campaign calls 3D-printed guns a "menace to society."  
5. **Doubt** – No – No direct questioning of credibility (e.g., no "Can we trust this judge?").  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Descriptions (e.g., "menace to society") are attributed to sources, not presented as fact by the article.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity (e.g., no "true Americans support this").  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Terms like "wrong hands," "lone wolf," "menace to society," and "dangerous and reckless actions" evoke fear and moral judgment.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association of ideas with hated groups (e.g., no linking Wilson to Nazis).  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on popularity (e.g., no "millions agree").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Complex legal/technical issues (e.g., compliance with firearm laws) are explained, not oversimplified.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Language is clear (e.g., details about legal rulings and gun designs are specific).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Authorities (e.g., courts, White House) are cited for facts, not to shut down debate.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Multiple perspectives (Wilson, states, NRA, courts) are presented without false dichotomies.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "it is what it is" to end debate. Wilson’s "The debate is over" is contextual, not clichéd.  
16. **Red herring** – No – All content relates directly to the legal battle or risks of 3D guns.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Arguments (e.g., states' safety concerns) are represented accurately.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no "What about other gun sales?").

### Verdict – 20% –   
The text is a **straight news report**, not propaganda. It neutrally presents multiple viewpoints (Cody Wilson, the White House, courts, states, NRA, Brady Campaign) and factual developments (legal rulings, downloads). While quoted sources use **emotionally loaded language** (e.g., "menace to society") or **fear appeals** (e.g., "wrong hands"), these are attributed and not the voice of the article itself. The piece lacks hallmarks of propaganda: no consistent bias, no repetition of slogans, no oversimplification, and no attempt to manipulate beyond reporting the conflict. Its primary aim is informational, not persuasive. The 20% reflects minor sensationalism in source quotes, but the framing remains journalistic.
