4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – "How deeply has America been compromised?" and "treason" (instills fear about national security).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Democrats claim they were never told about any of the cybersecurity issues" (questions credibility of Democrats).

### Verdict – 90% – The text is highly likely propaganda.  
**Explanation:**  
- **Sensationalism & Fearmongering:** The headline ("Muslim Spy Ring") and rhetorical questions ("How deeply has America been compromised?") use loaded language and fear to frame a cybersecurity issue as treasonous espionage. Religious profiling ("Muslim") is weaponized to imply inherent threat.  
- **Selective Framing:** Critical facts are omitted (e.g., no espionage charges filed; plea deal limited to bank fraud). Claims of a "missing server" are presented as fact despite contradictory evidence from Imran’s attorney and lack of public verification.  
- **Bias & Obfuscation:** Democrats are portrayed as complicit ("cover the matter up"), while evidence gaps (e.g., "prosecutors will bring no charges") are glossed over. The Kavanaugh poll serves as a red herring.  
- **Emotional Manipulation:** Repeated use of exaggeration ("treason"), authority appeals ("Congress’ Top Cop"), and thought-terminating clichés stifles critical analysis.  
- **Contextual Indicators:** The article’s source (Pamela Geller, known for anti-Muslim activism) and one-sided sourcing (e.g., Republican Rep. Gohmert; unnamed "officials") reinforce an agenda-driven narrative. While based on real events (Awan case), the text distorts them into a conspiratorial, partisan attack using multiple propaganda techniques.
