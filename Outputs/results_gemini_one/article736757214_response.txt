***

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It employs a multitude of propaganda techniques designed to manipulate the reader's emotions rather than to inform them. The piece relies heavily on name-calling, loaded language, and appeals to fear by focusing on extreme examples of violent crime. It creates a simplified narrative by using a straw man argument and a black & white fallacy, framing the mayor not as a political figure with a nuanced stance on immigration, but as a villain who knowingly protects violent criminals. The combination of these techniques demonstrates a clear intent to demonize the subject and provoke outrage, which are hallmarks of propaganda.
