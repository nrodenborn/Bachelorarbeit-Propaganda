Name calling – Yes – The text uses the poll answer "No, you can't act like a child and keep your pass" to attack Jim Acosta with an insulting label.

Repetition – Yes – The poll question "Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?" is repeated three times in a row.

Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate its own message or viewpoint.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text states, "This massive Democrat voter fraud could be the end of our free republic," which instills fear about the future of the country to support its argument.

Doubt – Yes – The text uses the rhetorical question, "Have you ever heard of a close election in which a recount and “found” ballots gave the Republican victory?" to question the credibility and legitimacy of the recount process.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text claims "massive Democrat voter fraud" and that officials are "'finding' boxes of them everywhere," which are exaggerations of the events being described to make them seem more severe.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the issue as a threat to the nation, stating the situation could be "the end of our free republic" and quoting Trump calling it an "embarrassment to our County and to Democracy!”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases like "disgrace," "outraged," and "massive Democrat voter fraud" to influence the reader's emotions. The use of quotation marks around the word "finding" is also used to imply a sinister, non-literal meaning.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparisons to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that an idea is correct because it is popular or that the reader should agree with the majority.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex situation of a statewide recount to a single, simple cause: "massive Democrat voter fraud," ignoring the legal and procedural nuances involved.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The phrase "‘finding’ boxes of them everywhere" is intentionally vague to suggest a widespread conspiracy without providing specific details.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses a quote from President Donald Trump ("This is an embarrassment to our County and to Democracy!") to validate its position and lend it authority.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text frames the situation as a choice between the initial election results and a fraudulent takeover by Democrats that will end the republic, ignoring other possibilities like a legitimate and legally mandated recount process.

Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses the short, dismissive phrase "This is a disgrace" to shut down nuanced discussion and present its conclusion as self-evident.

Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a poll about CNN's Jim Acosta, which is completely irrelevant to the Florida election recount, in order to distract the reader.

Straw men – Yes – The text portrays Andrew Gillum's position of "Every vote must be counted" as a call to count fraudulent votes, refuting this misrepresentation rather than his actual argument for counting all legally cast ballots.

Whataboutism – Yes – After briefly mentioning a Republican official breaking election law, the text immediately pivots to accuse Democrats of worse behavior: "Meanwhile, Democrat election officials are marking ballots themselves and “finding” boxes of them everywhere..." This deflects from the initial point by charging the opposition with hypocrisy.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally propaganda. It employs a vast majority (15 out of 18) of the listed propaganda techniques to promote a one-sided political narrative. Rather than presenting a balanced news report, it uses loaded language, appeals to fear, and logical fallacies like whataboutism and straw men to demonize the opposing political party. The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Jim Acosta poll) and the use of repetition further underscore its goal of manipulation and persuasion over factual reporting. The entire structure is designed not to inform, but to inflame and solidify a specific viewpoint by casting doubt on the democratic process itself.
