Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – The text does not use insulting labels against Officer Guyger or Jean. It reports facts and opinions without resorting to slurs.
2.  **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?" is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to summarize or promote a specific viewpoint about the event itself. The poll question is repeated but functions as a distraction, not a slogan for the core story.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text does not attempt to instill fear about alternatives or consequences related to the main event to support an idea. The outrage mentioned is a reported reaction, not a tool used by the author to scare the reader into a position.
5.  **Doubt** – Yes – The author explicitly questions the credibility of Guyger's account: "I have no idea how you can enter an apartment mistakenly. Does Guyger leave her door unlocked?" and "Ok, some of this seems plausible, but I still am left wondering about the door being ajar. Is this something people are prone to do at 1o o'clock at night in Dallas?".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Minimization: The quote from an officer close to Guyger saying "she is devastated" could be seen as minimizing the gravity of her actions or eliciting sympathy in contrast to the victim's death and the public outrage. Exaggeration: The phrase "outrage across the nation" slightly exaggerates the scale or uniformity of the reaction.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism, national identity, or group loyalty to frame the event or persuade the reader.
8.  **Loaded Language** – Yes – Words like "outrage," "devastated," and the implication in "we all know that any of us who did the same thing would have immediately been taken into custody" carry strong emotional connotations and value judgments.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – The text does not attempt to disapprove of Guyger's actions or the police response by associating them with a universally hated group or ideology.
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – The statement "we all know that any of us who did the same thing would have immediately been taken into custody" appeals to the popularity of the belief that civilians are treated differently/harsher than police officers to support the argument of unequal treatment.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – While the text reports Guyger's stated reason (mistaken apartment, perceived intruder), it doesn't present this as the *sole* or oversimplified cause of the complex event without acknowledging other factors (like her prior shooting, the investigation, the door being ajar). It presents details and expresses doubt.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is relatively clear and reports details from affidavits and police statements. While the author expresses doubt, the reporting of facts isn't deliberately obscure or vague.
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – The text cites sources (Dallas Police statement, affidavit, Dallas News, USA Today) for factual reporting, but does not use the support of an authority figure to specifically endorse a particular opinion or conclusion about the event's meaning or culpability.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents the factual sequence, the investigation, the arrest, the prior incident, and public reaction. It doesn't frame the situation as having only two possible interpretations or outcomes.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – The text doesn't employ phrases designed to shut down critical thinking about the event. The author's expressions of doubt actually invite questioning.
16. **Red herring** – Yes – The entire poll section ("take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley...") about the UN ambassador is completely irrelevant to the story about Officer Guyger and Botham Jean. It serves only to distract the reader.
17. **Straw men** – No – The text does not misrepresent or refute an argument that wasn't actually presented in the context of the reported events or the author's commentary.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – The text does not charge critics of the police/Guyger with hypocrisy by pointing to unrelated issues or past actions of their own.

**Verdict – 60% –** The text primarily reports factual details of a news event (the shooting, arrest, investigation, prior incident) using cited sources. However, it incorporates significant elements of propaganda. The author interjects clear expressions of **Doubt** regarding the officer's account, uses emotionally **Loaded Language** ("outrage," "devastated"), employs a **Bandwagon** appeal ("we all know..."), and includes a blatant **Red Herring** (the repeated UN ambassador poll). There is also a potential element of **Minimization** regarding the officer's state. While the core reporting is factual, the inclusion of the irrelevant poll, the author's opinionated questioning framed as common sense, and the emotionally charged language shift the purpose from pure information dissemination towards influencing the reader's perception of the officer's credibility and the fairness of the initial police response, indicating a persuasive intent characteristic of propaganda. The factual reporting basis prevents a higher percentage.
