Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by the verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "war hawks" (used to discredit neoconservatives), "darling child" (mocking MEK's privileged status).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No original, memorable phrases are coined; existing terms like "regime change" are used descriptively.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Warns that MEK support could "kick off World War 3" and references "horrific death tolls" in Syria, Iraq, etc.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions MEK's legitimacy: "despite neocon attempts to rewrite history, MEK have killed Americans."  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – Exaggerates MEK's influence ("darling child of the neocon agenda," impetus for WW3); minimizes potential complexity of U.S. intervention outcomes.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "Violent overthrow," "neocon agenda," "war-ravaged dystopias," "outright insane" evoke strong emotions.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Hitler/Nazis.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on the popularity of the anti-intervention stance.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Blames U.S. intervention alone for "horrific death tolls" in Syria, Iraq, etc., ignoring other factors.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Arguments are presented directly, not vaguely.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – Yes – Cites Pulitzer winner Seymour Hersh and General Wesley Clark to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Implies U.S. intervention *always* creates "war-ravaged dystopias" (e.g., Syria, Libya) with no nuance.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases like "case closed" or "end of story" to halt debate.  
16. **Red herring** – No – The poll about "corrupt Democrats" is irrelevant but presented as a separate ad; core arguments stay focused.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Accurately represents Bolton’s pro-regime-change stance without distortion.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – Does not deflect criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy.  

---

**Verdict – 85%** – The text exhibits strong propagandistic elements. It selectively presents facts (e.g., MEK's terrorist history, U.S. training) while employing loaded language, exaggeration, fear appeals, and oversimplified causality to vilify U.S. policy and MEK. The repetition of the poll question amplifies bias, and appeals to authority (Hersh, Clark) lend superficial credibility. Though it cites documented events, its framing is manipulative: it dismisses potential benefits of intervention ("outright insane"), ignores geopolitical complexities, and uses emotionally charged terms ("war-ravaged dystopias," "neocon agenda") to provoke alarm. The overt goal is to discredit U.S. actions toward Iran and MEK, not to offer balanced analysis. The inclusion of an irrelevant, repetitive poll further signals an intent to influence rather than inform.
