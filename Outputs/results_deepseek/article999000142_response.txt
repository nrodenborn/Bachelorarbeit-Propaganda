Here's the analysis of the text against the defined propaganda techniques:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Crooked Hillary" (insulting label).  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "Should military force be used to stop the caravan..." repeated verbatim three times.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases promoting an agenda.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – No explicit instillation of fear against alternatives (though the military poll implies threat).  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "Right, except she does just that..." (questions Clinton's credibility on inclusivity).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes – "every person with dark skin on the planet" (exaggerates scope of Clinton's remark); "they look nothing alike" (minimizes similarity between Booker/Holder).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "disgusting," "criminals," "fawned over," "lynching" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity of an idea.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – "The only thing... is that they are criminals" (reduces complex individuals to one trait).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – Yes – "her many crimes" (unspecified allegations).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No cited authority support.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomy presented.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to halt critical discussion.  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – "her many crimes, something we were promised... Trump" (irrelevant distraction from the topic).  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – "Clearly, she was speaking of all black people" (misrepresents Clinton’s context-specific remark).  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No direct accusation of hypocrisy against critics.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs multiple techniques (e.g., Name Calling, Loaded Language, Straw Men) to vilify Hillary Clinton while deflecting scrutiny from other figures. The framing of her remark ignores context ("they all look alike" was a self-deprecating correction of Swisher’s error), and hyperbolic claims ("insult[ing] every person with dark skin") manufacture outrage. Selective focus on Clinton’s error—contrasted with hypothetical consequences for conservatives—reveals partisan bias. The embedded military force poll (using Repetition) and Red Herrings ("many crimes") further distract from substantive discourse. While factual elements exist (e.g., Clinton’s gaffe), their manipulative presentation and omission of mitigating details (e.g., Booker/Holder’s responses, interview context) serve a clear agenda: delegitimizing Clinton and her supporters. The tone, unsupported assertions, and absence of balanced analysis confirm propaganda intent.
