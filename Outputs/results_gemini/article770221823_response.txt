Name calling – Yes – The text uses a quote describing the conquerors of Constantinople as “most inhuman barbarians” and “the most savage enemies of the Christian faith,” and refers to modern Westerners who might disagree with the author's premise as “gullible Westerners.”

Repetition – Yes – The poll question “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?” is repeated three times consecutively.

Slogans – Yes – The text uses the phrase “Don’t allow yourself to be fooled: arm yourself with the truth” as a memorable call to action.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses a graphic historical account of violence (“Men have been butchered like cattle, women abducted, virgins ravished”) and connects it to the modern issue of “mass Muslim migration,” implying a similar threat today and aiming to generate fear about this contemporary issue.

Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of “Western historians” for turning their attention away from the aftermath of the conquest and explicitly accuses Islamic scholar Akbar Ahmed of using tales of tolerance “to fool gullible Westerners.”

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses a quote that employs exaggeration with phrases like “butchered like cattle.” It also minimizes the work of other historians by claiming they simply “turn their attention away” from the topic.

Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a Western and Christian identity by framing the historical event as an attack by “savage enemies of the Christian faith” and connecting it to a modern threat to “Europe and North America.”

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases such as “warriors of jihad,” “inhuman barbarians,” “savage enemies,” “fiercest of wild beasts,” and “gullible Westerners” to evoke strong emotional reactions.

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an idea by associating it with Hitler or the Nazis.

Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its ideas are popular or that the reader should agree because many others do. In fact, it frames its position as a counter-narrative.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text implies that the sole cause for the historical violence was “jihad” and that the reason for modern Western “softness” on migration is simply being “fooled” by tales of tolerance, ignoring complex geopolitical, economic, and social factors.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text’s message is direct and clear, not intentionally vague or obscure.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites the “Byzantine scholar Bessarion” as an authority to validate its claims about the aftermath of the conquest.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a choice between two extremes: either you are a “gullible Westerner” being fooled by tales of Islamic tolerance, or you “arm yourself with the truth” by accepting the author’s narrative. It leaves no room for alternative interpretations.

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use common clichés to shut down discussion. Instead, it actively tries to persuade the reader to adopt its specific viewpoint.

Red herring – Yes – The repeated poll, “Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?”, is entirely irrelevant to the article’s topic of Islamic history and migration and serves as a distraction.

Straw men – Yes – The text attacks the concept of “the much-vaunted Islamic ‘tolerance’ in Europe” as if it is a single, simplistic claim that there was never any violence. It refutes this oversimplified version of a nuanced historical discussion rather than engaging with the actual arguments made by scholars.

Whataboutism – No – The text criticizes opponents but does not use the specific tactic of deflecting criticism by accusing them of hypocrisy on a related issue.

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and overt piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to provide a balanced historical account, but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, fearful viewpoint and, ultimately, to purchase a book. It employs a vast number of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal.

The piece uses emotionally loaded language, name-calling, and a graphic appeal to fear to create a strong emotional response in the reader. It establishes a black-and-white worldview where the reader must choose between being "gullible" or accepting the author's "truth." It employs a straw man argument against a vaguely defined concept of "Islamic tolerance" and uses causal oversimplification to link a single historical event to a complex modern issue (mass migration). The author casts doubt on mainstream historians and specific scholars to position himself as the sole bearer of truth, a claim reinforced by an appeal to a historical authority (Bessarion). The inclusion of a completely irrelevant red herring (the Kavanaugh poll) further underscores that the article's purpose is not journalistic or educational. The entire piece is a sales pitch framed as a dire warning, a hallmark of modern propaganda.
