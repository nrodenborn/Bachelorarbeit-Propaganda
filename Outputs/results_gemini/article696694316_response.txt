1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to a specific church leader as one of the "creatures like the myopic and theologically tunnel-visioned Cardinal Kasper."

2. Repetition – Yes – The central idea that the Church, and specifically the Eucharist, is under attack is repeated throughout the text, from the title ("The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist") to the body ("the attack from Rome on the moral doctrine of the Church isn’t about marriage. It’s about the Eucharist.").

3. Slogans – Yes – The text uses brief, memorable phrases to create a strong impression, such as describing the future as "a poisoned sea of systematic heresy and desecration" and the encyclical as "the key that opened the Door to Narnia."

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns of a coming "dark, impenetrable and “irreversible” winter of persecution of the faithful by their own shepherds will fall," instilling fear about the future of the Church if current trends continue.

5. Doubt – Yes – The author questions the credibility and motives of Church leaders, suggesting in a footnote that Pope Paul VI "knew perfectly well what was coming but approved the disastrous New Rite anyway," and states that their initial view of Catholicism came from "people who clearly hated the Church; her enemies, in short."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggerated language to describe the situation, such as "supreme moment of heresy and destruction," "catastrophically obscured," and a "poisoned sea of systematic heresy."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a specific Catholic identity by creating an in-group of "faithful priests, seminarians and laity" and "lighthouses" like Bishop Mark Davies, who uphold the "true Faith" against internal enemies.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases like "demonic forces," "pernicious nonsense," "wickedness," "disastrous New Rite," and "stitch-up."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – While the text associates opposing views with hated groups like "demonic forces," it does not use the specific technique of comparing them to Hitler or the Nazi party.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that an idea is correct because it is popular. In fact, it argues the opposite, suggesting a small, faithful remnant ("The few bishops with sufficient spine") is holding out against a popular, destructive trend.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the complex, multi-faceted changes in the Catholic Church regarding marriage and liturgy to a single, simple cause: "The demonic forces we know are the driving force behind this supreme moment of heresy and destruction... they want to get at the Eucharist."

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's language is direct and forceful, not intentionally vague or obscure. The points, while polemical, are clearly stated.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author bases much of the argument on the authority of Pope Paul VI’s encyclical "Mysterium Fidei," the Council of Trent, and supportive figures like Bishop Mark Davies.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a stark dichotomy between the "true Faith" and a "poisoned sea of systematic heresy and desecration." It also explicitly uses C.S. Lewis's trilemma to frame the pope's claims: "this pope was either mad, bad or telling the plain truth."

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like "We know it is demonically inspired" serve to shut down discussion by asserting a conclusion as a known fact and attributing it to a supernatural cause that is not open to rational debate.

16. Red herring – Yes – The author's long, personal story of their conversion and discovery of the encyclical, while emotionally compelling, serves to distract from a direct, theological argument about the current situation in Rome. It builds an emotional connection with the reader rather than focusing solely on the evidence for the central claim.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes the unstated argument that changes in the Church are driven by a "demonic" hatred for the Eucharist ("their hatred is for Christ Himself"), rather than engaging with the proponents' actual stated arguments, which are typically based on concepts of mercy and pastoral care.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not primarily use the technique of deflecting criticism by accusing the opposition of hypocrisy on other issues.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs a vast majority of the listed techniques not merely as rhetorical flourishes, but as the fundamental structure of its argument. The piece is not a balanced theological analysis but a polemic designed to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, alarmist worldview.

The core of the text is built on a foundation of **Causal Oversimplification** (complex church politics are a "demonic attack on the Eucharist"), **Appeal to Fear** (a "winter of persecution" is coming), and a stark **Black & White Fallacy** (the world is divided into faithful "lighthouses" and a "poisoned sea of heresy"). This framework is reinforced by constant use of **Loaded Language** ("wickedness," "disaster," "demonic") and **Name Calling** ("myopic... Cardinal Kasper") to demonize opponents.

While the author does engage with a primary source ("Mysterium Fidei"), it is used as an **Appeal to Authority** to validate a pre-drawn conclusion about a contemporary crisis. The extensive personal narrative, rather than providing objective evidence, functions as a **Red Herring** to build an emotional bond with the reader and lend personal weight to the alarmist claims. The purpose is not to inform or encourage critical thought, but to rally a specific in-group (traditionalist Catholics) by creating a narrative of imminent disaster and persecution from an evil, internal enemy. The sheer number and intensity of the propaganda techniques used indicate a primary goal of persuasion through emotional manipulation rather than reasoned discourse.
