**Final Verdict**

**Verdict – 90% –**  
The text exhibits a high concentration of propaganda techniques, including name calling, repetition, slogans, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, causal oversimplification, intentional vagueness, black & white fallacy, thought-terminating clichés, and red herrings. These are used to undermine trust in authorities, create a sense of outrage and fear, and promote a particular narrative about the Las Vegas shooting investigation. The use of emotionally charged language, repeated slogans, and appeals to patriotism and fear are classic hallmarks of propaganda. While there is some factual reporting (such as quoting officials and describing the timeline), the overall framing and rhetorical strategies strongly indicate that the primary intent is to persuade and provoke rather than objectively inform. Therefore, there is a 90% likelihood that this text is propaganda.
