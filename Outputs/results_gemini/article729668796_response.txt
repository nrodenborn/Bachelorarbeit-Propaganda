1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels migrants as "illegal Muslim invaders" and "antichrists."

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text stokes fear by linking migrants to terrorism, citing "27 major terrorist attacks in Europe" and the creation of "no-go zones," and warns of "the judgments God warned about."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the motives and actions of EU officials, stating they are "openly planning to push the mandatory resettlement quota through by force while totally ignoring the will of certain EU member states," which casts doubt on their credibility.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text uses exaggeration by describing migration as a "Muslim invasion" and a "wholesale flood of antichrists." It also minimizes the complexity of EU policy by framing it simply as "extortion."

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text appeals to the shared stance of the “Visegrád countries” to show that Hungary is not alone in its position, suggesting a collective and popular movement among those nations.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text simplifies complex issues by stating that "people with immigrant backgrounds have committed 27 major terrorist attacks," implying immigration is the sole cause of terrorism, and that Orban's wall "virtually eliminated illegal immigration," ignoring other contributing factors.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text’s language is direct and blunt rather than intentionally vague or obscure; its message is very clear.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites political authorities like Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Minister Péter Szijjártó, and also appeals to religious authority by referencing the Bible (Deuteronomy) to support its argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a simple choice between two extremes: either fighting to preserve the "Christian identity of Europe" or allowing a "Muslim invasion" and the changes it supposedly brings.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The slogan “For us, Hungary is first” is used as a definitive statement to end debate and justify a position without further argument.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces a biblical reference to Deuteronomy, distracting from the modern political and legal debate about EU migration policy by shifting the focus to ancient religious law.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the EU's position by framing a potential qualified majority vote (a standard procedure) as "extortion" and a plan to "push the mandatory resettlement quota through by force," creating a distorted and more sinister argument to attack.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text attacks its opponents directly but does not attempt to deflect criticism by accusing them of hypocrisy or pointing out their own unrelated wrongdoings.

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a strong anti-immigration and pro-Orban stance by employing a wide array of propaganda techniques. The article uses highly emotional and loaded language (Name calling, Loaded Language) to dehumanize migrants ("invaders," "antichrists") and create a sense of crisis. It heavily relies on an Appeal to Fear by linking immigration directly to terrorism and societal collapse. The argument is framed as a simple Black & White Fallacy: a heroic defense of "Christian identity" (Flag-Waving) against an evil external threat. The text presents a one-sided narrative, using Appeals to Authority (Orban, his minister, the Bible) without including any opposing viewpoints or context. It also employs logical fallacies like Causal Oversimplification and Straw Men to distort the situation and make its own position seem more logical. The sheer number and blatant use of these techniques confirm the text's nature as propaganda designed to manipulate opinion rather than foster understanding.
