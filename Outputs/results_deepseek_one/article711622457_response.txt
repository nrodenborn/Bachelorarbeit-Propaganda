### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:  

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** –  
   Explanation: Labels opponents with negative terms ("jihad preachers", "fascism", "far-right bloggers"). Example: "Bryant cited the cases of two US *far-right bloggers*, Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller."  

2. **Repetition** – **Yes** –

3. **Slogans** – **Yes** –  
   Explanation: Uses Trump’s tweet as a rallying cry: "focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism."  

4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** –  
   Explanation: Highlights extreme quotes from jihad preachers (e.g., chopping heads, burning homosexuals) to instill fear about UK immigration policies.  

5. **Doubt** – **Yes** –  
   Explanation: Questions UK authorities’ credibility: "Why are we ‘far right’?" and "Bryant had nothing to say about any of those jihad preachers."  

6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** –  
   Explanation: Minimizes Trump’s retweets as "shoot the messenger" while exaggerating UK’s admission of extremists ("steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers").  

7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** –  
   Explanation: Appeals to British values: "Everything we do is in defense of the freedom of speech and equality of rights."  

8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** –  
   Explanation: Uses emotionally charged terms like "jihad atrocities," "destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism," and "fascism."  

9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **Yes** –  
   Explanation: Links Bryant’s actions to banning "far-right figures," implicitly associating critics with fascism. Example: Bryant’s call to ban Trump "like those that apply to other far-right figures."  

10. **Bandwagon** – **No** –  
    Explanation: No appeal to popularity; focuses on principles rather than public opinion.  

11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** –  
    Explanation: Blames UK’s focus on Trump for ignoring jihad terror, simplifying a complex geopolitical issue.

    Explanation: Cites UK Home Office decisions and preachers’ quotes as evidence: "the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain."  

14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** –  
    Explanation: Presents a false dichotomy: focus on jihad terror (good) vs. "shoot the messenger" (bad).  

15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** –  
    Explanation: Uses phrases like "shoot the messenger" to dismiss criticism of Trump’s retweets.  

16. **Red herring** – **Yes** –

17. **Straw men** – **Yes** –

18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** –  
    Explanation: Deflects criticism of Trump by highlighting UK’s admission of extremists: "Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers... Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops."

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 85% –**  
The text is highly likely propaganda. It systematically employs **15/18** listed techniques to advance a partisan narrative. Core tactics include:  
- **Loaded language** and **appeal to fear** to vilify Islamist extremists while downplaying Trump’s actions.  
- **Whataboutism** and **red herring** to deflect criticism of Trump by attacking UK immigration policies.  
- **Straw men** and **name-calling** to misrepresent opponents (e.g., Bryant’s "fascism" claim).  
- **Black/white framing** to simplify the issue as "jihad terror vs. censorship."  
The author (Robert Spencer) is a controversial figure with a history of anti-Islam rhetoric, and the text promotes his ideological agenda by weaponizing selective facts, emotional language, and false equivalencies. While it cites real events, its persuasive intent, one-sided framing, and reliance on propaganda techniques outweigh journalistic objectivity.
