### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:  

1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against any subject.  
2. **Repetition** – No – The core message (Ebola cases confirmed) is stated once; no redundant phrasing.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases designed for persuasion (e.g., "Stop Ebola Now!").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – Facts about Ebola’s severity are presented neutrally; no language exaggerating threats to manipulate.  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility (e.g., sources like WHO/government are cited without skepticism).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Statistics (e.g., "17 deaths," "11,300 died") are reported factually; no obvious amplification or downplaying.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or identity (e.g., no "our nation must unite" rhetoric).  
8. **Loaded Language** – No – Clinical terms ("hemorrhagic fever," "Zaire strain") lack emotional/stereotypical weight.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No association of ideas with hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No emphasis on popularity to sway opinion (e.g., "everyone agrees").  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – Transmission is explained multifactorially (bats, bushmeat, human contact), not simplistically.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are specific (locations, case numbers, sources); no ambiguous phrasing.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Authorities (Jean Jack Muyembe, health ministry, WHO) are cited to validate facts, though this aligns with standard reporting.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomies (e.g., "only two choices exist").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases halting debate (e.g., "end of story").  
16. **Red herring** – No – All details relate directly to Ebola; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy.  

### Verdict – 5%  
**Explanation**: The text is a factual news report with minimal propagandistic elements. It cites authoritative sources (e.g., health officials, WHO) and historical data to inform, not persuade. The single "appeal to authority" (technique 13) is standard journalistic practice for credibility and does not distort facts. Language is neutral, statistics are contextualized, and multiple perspectives (e.g., origins, transmission, past outbreaks) are included without bias. The 5% likelihood reflects the inherent risk in any authoritative citation being misconstrued as manipulative, but the overall tone prioritizes public health awareness over agenda-pushing.
