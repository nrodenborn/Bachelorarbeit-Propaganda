Based on the definitions provided and the given text, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – "Authorities LIED" (Headline), "FBI specifically lied" (Paragraph 5). The term "lied" is an insulting label directly attacking the authorities/FBI.
2.  **Repetition** – **Yes** – The core message that authorities lied or misled is repeated multiple times: "authorities have directly lied" (P3), "FBI specifically lied" (P5), "misled public" (Tweet ref), "FBI, along with state and local police, specifically lied" (P8), "authorities... cannot be trusted" (P12).
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – "What Else Are They Hiding?" (Headline). This is a brief, memorable phrase encapsulating the core suspicion.
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "This throws their entire narrative into question and makes one wonder what else is being hidden from the public?" (P9). This instills fear that authorities are hiding crucial, potentially dangerous information.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The entire text is structured to cast doubt on the official narrative: "What Else Are They Hiding?" (Headline), "many different theories have been put forth that counter the mainstream narrative" (P2), "makes one wonder what else is being hidden" (P9), "every piece of so-called evidence... cannot be trusted" (P12).
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – "literally every piece of so-called evidence put forth by authorities... cannot be trusted" (P12). This exaggerates the scope of potential unreliability to encompass *all* evidence.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **No** – There is no explicit appeal to patriotism or national identity.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Words like "LIED" (Headline), "covering up" (P2), "misled" (Tweets), "Shockingly" (P6), "horrific" (P7), "disinformation" (P12), "bizarre" (P14) are emotionally charged and carry strong negative connotations.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No association with universally hated groups (like Nazis) is made to discredit the official narrative.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – "Over the last few days the alternative media has spent countless hours conducting their own investigations" (P1), "the Drudge Report even linked to an article asking them directly" (P11). This implies the ideas are popular and validated by others (alternative media, Drudge Report).
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – The text implies that the discrepancies in the check-in date and license plate number *prove* a broader cover-up or that the entire official narrative is false ("This throws their entire narrative into question" - P9, "every piece... cannot be trusted" - P12), simplifying a complex investigation into evidence of deliberate deception.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – The text is direct in its accusations and points (lying about date, license plate). It doesn't rely on deliberately unclear language to confuse.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The evidence and conclusions rely heavily on "investigative reporter Laura Loomer" (P3) and her tweets/photos as proof.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – "every piece of so-called evidence put forth by authorities... cannot be trusted and should be considered as disinformation until proven otherwise" (P12). This presents the situation as authorities are *completely* untrustworthy vs. their evidence being potentially reliable.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "disinformation" (P12), "so-called evidence" (P12). These terms are used to dismiss the official evidence and narrative outright, discouraging critical evaluation of the authorities' potential explanations or the context of the discrepancies.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Introducing Eric Paddock's "bizarre interviews" (P14) and the existence of security camera footage (P13) distracts from the core claims about the check-in date/license plate and shifts focus onto unrelated (though tangentially connected) points implying broader conspiracy without evidence.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – The text attacks the specific claims made by authorities (check-in date, license plate) that it presents. It doesn't refute an argument the authorities didn't actually make.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – The text does not charge opponents with hypocrisy by pointing to their own misdeeds.

**Verdict – 90% –** The text is highly likely propaganda. It employs a significant number of propaganda techniques (Name Calling, Repetition, Slogans, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Exaggeration, Loaded Language, Bandwagon, Causal Oversimplification, Appeal to Authority, Black & White Fallacy, Thought-Terminating Clichés, Red Herring) to aggressively challenge the official narrative surrounding the Las Vegas shooting. Its primary goal is not balanced reporting but to instill deep distrust in authorities ("literally every piece... cannot be trusted"), imply a cover-up ("What Else Are They Hiding?"), and promote alternative theories ("multiple shooters," "ISIS connection") by focusing intensely on specific discrepancies (check-in date, license plate) while dismissing the entire official account. The reliance on a single source (Laura Loomer), emotionally charged language, logical fallacies, and diversionary tactics strongly indicate an intent to manipulate the reader's perception and belief rather than objectively inform.
