1. Name calling – Yes – Ferrara calls Fastiggi's argument "sophistical" and his questions "clumsy and insulting." He also refers to defenders of Amoris Laetitia as "latter-day Pharisees and legalists."

2. Repetition – Yes – Ferrara repeatedly insists that Amoris Laetitia is being used to admit "public adulterers" to Holy Communion. Fastiggi repeatedly argues that his opponents have "failed to grasp its true meaning" and that the "generous response" is a move away from sin.

3. Slogans – Yes – Fastiggi uses the phrase "This is the law of gradualness not the gradualness of the law," which is a brief, memorable theological phrase used to frame his argument.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – Ferrara warns of a "moral catastrophe" unfolding in the Church. Fastiggi raises the possibility of Ferrara being in "schism," a state of grave spiritual danger for a Catholic.

5. Doubt – Yes – Fastiggi questions Ferrara's credibility and understanding by stating, "As a lawyer, Ferrara should have a better sense of what really counts as evidence" and "you do not reveal a proper understanding of what Pope Francis is saying."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Ferrara exaggerates by referring to a "growing mountain of evidence" and a "moral catastrophe." Fastiggi minimizes Ferrara's evidence by calling it "very thin evidence."

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – Fastiggi appeals to Catholic identity and loyalty to the papacy by framing his position as a defense of "the Roman Pontiff" and questioning if Ferrara is "refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff."

8. Loaded Language – Yes – Both speakers use emotionally charged words. Ferrara uses terms like "sophistical," "pretense," and "moral catastrophe." Fastiggi uses "bearing false witness" and "schism."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – Ferrara uses a variation of this technique by labeling his opponents "the latter-day Pharisees and legalists," associating them with a group universally condemned within the Christian tradition.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – Ferrara appeals to the popularity of his viewpoint by citing its many supporters: "the four cardinals, the 800,000 faithful, the 45 theologians and the 61 other original signers of the correctio."

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Ferrara claims, "A moral catastrophe is self-evidently underway and it is not possible honestly to deny its cause," attributing a complex situation within the Church to the single cause of the document Amoris Laetitia.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – Ferrara accuses Fastiggi of using "verbal artifice" to "conceal what is happening." Fastiggi's detailed theological explanation of AL 303, while precise to him, is accused by Ferrara of being a "sophistical attempt to explain away what Francis is clearly doing."

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – Fastiggi cites Pope Francis, Cardinal Müller, Cardinal Schoenborn, and the philosopher Rocco Buttiglione. Ferrara cites "the four cardinals," Pope John Paul II, and the "bimillenial discipline of the Church."

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – Fastiggi presents a false choice when he asks Ferrara if he is "refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff," implying that questioning the papal document is equivalent to schism, and ignoring any middle ground of loyal opposition or questioning.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Fastiggi's request that Ferrara "study the matter more carefully with an open heart and mind" is used to dismiss his opponent's arguments by suggesting a personal failing rather than engaging with the substance of the critique.

16. Red herring – Yes – Fastiggi introduces the topic of Ferrara's "standing in the Catholic Church" and the possibility of him being in "schism." This serves to distract from the core argument about the text of Amoris Laetitia and instead attacks Ferrara's personal religious status.

17. Straw men – Yes – Fastiggi refutes an argument he attributes to his opponents, stating they "are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state." Ferrara, in turn, dismisses Fastiggi's "brother and sister" example as a straw man because it "is certainly not the one advocated by Francis."

18. Whataboutism – Yes – After Fastiggi advises Ferrara to study the matter with an "open heart and mind," Ferrara retorts, "I think you should follow your own advice about studying this matter with an open heart and mind," deflecting the criticism back onto his opponent.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a polemical exchange where both participants heavily employ propaganda techniques to win an argument rather than engage in a purely rational, academic debate. The density of these techniques is extremely high, with nearly every paragraph from both speakers containing at least one, and often several, of the listed methods. Techniques such as name-calling ("sophistical"), appeal to fear ("moral catastrophe," "schism"), loaded language, and appeals to authority are used consistently to discredit the opponent and his arguments. Both sides use straw man arguments to misrepresent the other's position, red herrings to distract from the central point (e.g., shifting from the text's meaning to Ferrara's "standing in the Church"), and whataboutism to deflect criticism. The entire exchange is framed as a high-stakes battle for the future of the Church, which encourages the use of emotional, manipulative, and persuasive language over dispassionate analysis. While substantive points are raised, they are deeply embedded within a framework of propaganda designed to persuade the audience by any means necessary.
