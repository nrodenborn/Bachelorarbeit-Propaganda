Based on the provided definitions, here is the analysis for each propaganda technique in the text:

1.  **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text repeatedly uses insulting labels like "the swamp," "swamp creatures," and "one of the worst swamp creatures in D.C." to describe Dina Powell and her associations.
2.  **Repetition** – **No** – Explanation: While the message is consistent, there is no significant repetition of the *exact same phrase or sentence* throughout the text to hammer the point home.
3.  **Slogans** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "drain the swamp" is used as a brief, memorable slogan representing Trump's campaign promise, central to the argument ("President Trump came in promising to drain the swamp").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text warns that appointing Powell would "quickly undo all the progress that Haley made," lead the US back into the "Human Rights Council," result in "moves in favor of the PLO," bring back "the same old failed politics," and be "an even bigger disaster," instilling fear of negative consequences.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text consistently questions Powell's credibility, loyalty, and suitability by associating her with figures disliked by the target audience (Jarrett, Abedin, Clinton, Power, PLO figures, Obama officials) and implying she doesn't share Trump's "drain the swamp" goals ("Appointing her to the UN would give Trump, Jeb Bush's policies").
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Explanation: Descriptions like "one of the worst swamp creatures in D.C." and implying her appointment alone would swiftly reverse major US policy positions at the UN are significant exaggerations. Minimization is seen in dismissing her relevant experience ("Unlike McFarland, Habib Powell had no national security background").
7.  **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text appeals to patriotism by contrasting Powell negatively with Nikki Haley's actions ("Haley sent a message that UN members will be punished if they push the US around"), framing Haley's approach as protecting US interests and Powell's potential approach as detrimental to them.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text uses emotionally charged and negatively connotative words throughout: "the swamp," "pal around," "palling around," "cozy with," "swiftly undo," "disaster," "swamp creatures," "befriended," "angry left-wing Democrats." These appeal to emotions (distrust, disgust) and stereotypes (establishment insider, disloyal).
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not attempt to disapprove of Powell or her ideas by associating them with Nazis or similarly universally reviled groups. The Vichy reference in the definition example is absent here.
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not argue for or against Powell based on the popularity of the idea or what others (besides the "GOP establishment" negatively) are doing. It focuses on her associations and perceived dangers.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text oversimplifies complex international relations and UN dynamics by attributing potential negative outcomes (US rejoining HRC, supporting PLO, failed politics returning) solely to Powell's appointment ("Making Dina Powell the US Ambassador to the UN would quickly undo all the progress that Haley made").
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: The text is generally direct and specific in its accusations and associations, listing events, organizations, and individuals Powell is connected to. It doesn't rely on deliberately unclear expressions.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **No** – Explanation: While figures like Valerie Jarrett, Samantha Power, and Huma Abedin are mentioned, their support or opinions of Powell are presented negatively (as associations proving she's "the swamp"). There is no use of an authority figure's support *as evidence* for the *truth* of the author's claims about Powell's unsuitability. The quotes are used to illustrate her connections, not to validate the argument.
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Explanation: The text presents the choice as binary: either "drain the swamp" (by rejecting Powell) or "appoint the swamp" (by appointing Powell, leading to disaster). It ignores any potential middle ground or nuanced assessment of her qualifications or potential actions ("You don't drain the swamp by appointing the swamp").
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Explanation: The phrase "drain the swamp" is used as a definitive, emotionally charged label that simplifies a complex concept (reducing corruption/influence) and shuts down deeper analysis of Powell's specific record or potential policies.
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Explanation: Many details about Powell's past associations (e.g., her ex-husband's job at Teneo, Noa Meyer's past work for Hillary, attending galas, specific projects like 10,000 Women or Vital Voices, praise for Jarrett/Power) are largely irrelevant to her potential competence as UN Ambassador but are used to distract and build a negative image through guilt-by-association.
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not misrepresent an opposing argument and then refute that misrepresentation. It directly attacks Powell and her associations.
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: The text does not charge Powell or her supporters with hypocrisy by pointing out inconsistencies in their past actions or statements relative to their current position. The focus is on attacking Powell directly.

**Verdict – 95% – Explanation:** The text employs a high concentration of recognized propaganda techniques. Its core purpose is not balanced analysis but to vehemently oppose Dina Powell's potential appointment through relentless negative framing. Key indicators include pervasive **Name Calling** ("swamp," "swamp creatures"), **Loaded Language** creating a negative emotional tone, **Appeal to Fear** regarding policy consequences, **Doubt** cast through extensive guilt-by-association (**Red Herring**), **Causal Oversimplification** of complex geopolitical outcomes, **Exaggeration** of her influence and danger, **Black & White Fallacy** presenting the choice simplistically, and the use of a **Slogan** ("drain the swamp") as a **Thought-terminating cliché**. While it contains factual elements (e.g., past positions, associations), these facts are selectively presented and woven into a narrative designed to provoke rejection rather than inform. The overwhelming reliance on these persuasive, often emotionally manipulative techniques over substantive policy critique strongly indicates the text functions as propaganda.
