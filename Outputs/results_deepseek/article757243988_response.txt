Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by a verdict:

1. **Name calling** – No – No direct insulting labels are applied to the school or Islam (e.g., no terms like "evil" or "traitors").  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – The poll question *"Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?"* is repeated verbatim three times consecutively.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases are used to summarize the message (e.g., no equivalents to "Save Our Schools").  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Implies Islam is being forced on children ("schoolchildren being forced to make professions of faith"), framing it as a threat to Christian values.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions the school's legitimacy: *"Then when administrators are confronted, they claim it was all just an educational exercise"* (suggesting dishonesty).  
6. **Exaggeration/Minimization** – Yes – Minimizes Christianity's coverage (*"very little time was spent teaching about Jesus"*) while exaggerating Islam's imposition (*"forced to make professions of faith"*).  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No explicit appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – Uses emotionally charged terms like *"Submission to Allah"* (instead of neutral "profession of faith") and *"furious"* to provoke outrage.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparison to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – The poll implies reader agreement (*"Whom do you consider..."*) and cites Penkoski’s "online ministry" to suggest popular support.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – Yes – Attributes preferential treatment of Islam to unexplained bias (*"For some reason, this form of educational exercise is only ever used regarding Islam"*) without evidence.  
12. **Obfuscation, Intentional Vagueness** – Yes – The poll’s purpose is unclear (e.g., how results relate to the story), creating confusion.  
13. **Appeal to Authority** – Yes – Cites "Robert Spencer" (controversial anti-Islam author) for legitimacy via *"Article posted with permission"*.  
14. **Black & White Fallacy** – Yes – Frames Islam as uniquely favored (*"we never, ever see Judaism or Christianity... taught as fact"*), ignoring possible nuances.  
15. **Thought-Terminating Clichés** – Yes – Uses *"We see this again and again"* to dismiss counterarguments.  
16. **Red Herring** – Yes – The corrupt-Democrat poll distracts from the school story.  
17. **Straw Men** – Yes – Claims the school teaches Islam as fact (*"affirm Islam as fact"*), though the assignment was calligraphy practice.  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Asks *"why is that?"* implying hypocrisy in not similarly "forcing" other religions.  

---

**Verdict – 80%** – The text extensively employs propaganda techniques to frame a calligraphy exercise as religious coercion. Key indicators include:  
- **Loaded language** ("submission to Allah") and **appeal to fear** to vilify Islam.  
- **Repetition** (poll) and **bandwagon** tactics to manufacture consensus.  
- **Doubt** and **straw men** to discredit the school's educational intent.  
- **Red herring** (irrelevant poll) and **whataboutism** to evade substantive discussion.  
- **Causal oversimplification** and **black/white fallacy** to portray Islam as uniquely privileged.  
While based on a real event, the text selectively omits context (e.g., comparative religious units) and amplifies emotional rhetoric to advance an anti-Islam narrative. The sheer density of techniques (11/18 identified) confirms a propagandistic structure aimed at provoking outrage rather than balanced reporting.
