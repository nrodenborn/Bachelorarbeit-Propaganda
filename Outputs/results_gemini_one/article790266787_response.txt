1. Name calling – Yes – The text refers to Michael Avenatti as a “creepy porn lawyer,” a “third rate lawyer,” a “total low-life,” and a “con artist.” The title itself, “Avenatti’s Freak Show,” is also an example.

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly pushes the central message that the allegations are a last-minute, politically motivated smear campaign. This idea is phrased in multiple ways, such as “eleventh-hour character-assassination attempts,” the “enraged Left’s determination to prevent the judge’s ascent,” and “the purpose of the Left’s frenzied, demagogic assault is to damage the nominee.”

3. Slogans – No – The text quotes slogans used by others (e.g., Rush Limbaugh's statement) but does not employ its own distinct, brief, and memorable phrase as a persuasive tool throughout the article.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text uses quotes to instill fear of political consequences if Kavanaugh is not confirmed. Example: "And if the Left can stop Kavanaugh we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime on the Supreme Court."

5. Doubt – Yes – The text consistently works to create doubt about the accusers' credibility and motives. Example: “odds are Ford is lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder such as false memory syndrome.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the actions of the opposition while minimizing the seriousness of the allegations. Example of exaggeration: “the Left’s frenzied, demagogic assault.”

7. Flag-Waving – No – The text appeals to a political identity (conservatism) rather than a national or patriotic identity. The arguments are framed in terms of partisan struggle (Left vs. conservatives, Democrats vs. Republicans), not as an appeal to "America" or "the people" as a whole.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases intended to influence the reader. Example: “Even more eleventh-hour character-assassination attempts may be coming given the enraged Left’s determination to prevent the judge’s ascent to the Supreme Court at all costs.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not a direct comparison to Nazis, the text uses a comparison to another hated historical practice to discredit the proceedings, which fits the definition. Example: "But all the lies about Thomas at what he described as a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” had an effect."

10. Bandwagon – No – The text argues against the growing popular opinion (the poll showing a plurality of Americans opposing Kavanaugh), framing it as the result of media manipulation rather than a reason to agree with the opposition.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex situation of multiple, independent allegations to a single, simple cause: a political plot. Example: “Conservatives need to remember that the purpose of the Left’s frenzied, demagogic assault is to damage the nominee, and by extension, the president who nominated him.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague or obscure. Its point of view is aggressive, direct, and very clear, using strong language to persuade rather than confuse.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses quotes from conservative authority figures to bolster its argument. Example: “President Trump quoted the nation’s most prominent conservative radio host as he urged GOP senators to get onboard Tuesday: ‘Rush Limbaugh to Republicans: ‘You can kiss the MIDTERMS goodbye if you don’t get highly qualified Kavanaugh approved.’’”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy regarding Christine Blasey Ford's motivations, ignoring other possibilities. Example: “odds are Ford is lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder such as false memory syndrome.”

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a phrase to shut down nuanced discussion about the motivations behind the conflict by reducing it to a simple, cynical absolute. Example: "We're watching a period where what we have to understand is this is about raw power."

16. Red herring – Yes – The text dedicates significant space to attacking Michael Avenatti’s character, distracting from the substance of the allegations made by his client and others. Example: “To no one’s surprise, Trump’s legal tormentor, Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti, whom Tucker Carlson has dubbed ‘creepy porn lawyer,’ is representing Swetnick.”

17. Straw men – Yes – The text misrepresents the motives of the opposition to make them easier to attack, claiming their goal is not truth but political damage. Example: “Democrats predictably freaked out at the decision to have a woman lead the questioning since their primary objective here is to embarrass and discredit Kavanaugh and other Republicans, not get at the truth.”

18. Whataboutism – No – The text focuses on direct attacks and drawing parallels (like to the Clarence Thomas hearing) rather than deflecting criticism by accusing opponents of hypocrisy on a similar but different issue.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and powerful example of propaganda. It does not attempt to provide a balanced or objective account of the events surrounding the Kavanaugh confirmation. Instead, its primary purpose is to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint. This is achieved through the heavy and repeated use of numerous propaganda techniques, with 13 of the 18 listed techniques being actively employed.

The piece is saturated with **Loaded Language** ("character-assassination," "enraged Left"), **Name Calling** ("creepy porn lawyer," "con artist"), and **Exaggeration** ("frenzied, demagogic assault") to create a strong emotional bias against Kavanaugh's opponents from the outset. It systematically uses **Doubt** to undermine the credibility of the accusers, presenting them as liars or psychologically unstable.

The core argument relies on logical fallacies like **Causal Oversimplification** (blaming everything on a "Left" conspiracy), the **Black & White Fallacy** (Ford is either lying or has a mental disorder), and the **Straw Man** (misrepresenting Democrats' motives as purely malicious). It uses **Appeal to Authority** by quoting conservative figures like Trump, Gingrich, and Limbaugh, and **Appeal to Fear** by warning of a future without conservative justices.

The text is not journalism; it is a persuasive polemic designed to manipulate the reader's perception and solidify a particular narrative by overwhelming rational analysis with emotional appeals and rhetorical fallacies.
