### Propaganda Technique Analysis:
1. **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are used against the subject (e.g., Quentin Smith is described factually as a "convicted felon," not with slurs).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No phrases or ideas are repeated for emphasis.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., "Build the Wall") appear.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – The text describes events without instilling fear about broader issues (e.g., no warnings about crime waves or racial threats).  
5. **Doubt** – No – No questioning of credibility (e.g., no undermining of law enforcement or media).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – Statements are factual (e.g., "convicted felon," "not allowed to have a gun") without clear exaggeration/minimization.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or group identity (e.g., no "America first" rhetoric).  
8. **Loaded Language** – No – Language is neutral (e.g., "domestic violence victim" is descriptive, not emotionally charged).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or universally hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity (e.g., no "everyone agrees" claims).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified causes (e.g., crime is not blamed solely on race).  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Details are specific (e.g., timelines, sources cited clearly).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No authoritative figures or institutions are cited as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – No false dichotomies (e.g., no "us vs. them" framing).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases halting debate (e.g., "great work" is praise, not a cliché).  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Speculation about the wife’s race ("The fact that there was a wedding makes me think she’s white") distracts from the crime’s details. This irrelevant focus could imply racial narratives.  
17. **Straw men** – No – No misrepresented arguments are refuted.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy (e.g., no deflection like "What about other crimes?").  

### Verdict – 25% –  
The text is minimally propagandistic, primarily due to the **red herring** technique (irrelevant focus on race). It otherwise reports facts (e.g., Smith’s criminal record) without overt emotional manipulation, fear-mongering, or common propaganda hallmarks. However, the emphasis on racial details—especially the speculative framing of the victim’s race—aligns with VDARE.com’s known editorial stance on race and immigration, subtly pushing an ideological narrative. This makes it borderline biased reporting rather than overt propaganda.
