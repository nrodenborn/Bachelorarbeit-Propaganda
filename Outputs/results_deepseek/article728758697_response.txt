### Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the Text:  

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "Hitler-Loving Anti-Semite" (label attacking Farrakhan), "racist hate group leader".  
2. **Repetition** – Yes – "thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands" (emphasizing Farrakhan's influence); repeated claims of media bias.  
3. **Slogans** – Yes – "Except when it’s coming from inside the house" (memorable phrase framing hypocrisy).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – Yes – Implies unchecked left-wing anti-Semitism threatens fairness (e.g., "The media is happy to talk about anti-Semitism. It just won’t address left-wing anti-Semitism").  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – Questions media credibility: "It’s maintained a solid boycott on reporting on the photo of Obama posing with Farrakhan".  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – Yes –  
   - *Exaggeration*: "thousands and thousands..." (hyperbolic repetition).  
   - *Minimization*: Davis dismissing Farrakhan’s history as mere "inflammatory comments".  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or national identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "racist hate group leader", "inflammatory comments", "hypocrisy" (emotionally charged terms).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – Yes – Explicitly ties Farrakhan to Hitler: "Farrakhan had praised Hitler... ‘Hitler was a very great man’".  
10. **Bandwagon** – Yes – "He was just saying what most of them think" (implying the Congressional Black Caucus widely agrees).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified cause-effect claims.  
12. **Obfuscation** – No – Language is direct, not deliberately vague.  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – No cited authority figures endorsing claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – Yes – Portrays media as only addressing right-wing racism: "The media is happy to talk about anti-Semitism. It just won’t address left-wing anti-Semitism".  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – Yes – "Obviously not" (shuts down debate on Republican hypocrisy); "Don’t expect it to condemn" (dismisses accountability).  
16. **Red herring** – Yes – Shifts focus to Obama/CBC: "Obama’s meeting with Farrakhan was part of a CBC event" (distracts from Davis’s comments).  
17. **Straw men** – Yes – Implies media "excuses" left-wing racism without evidence of this stance.  
18. **Whataboutism** – Yes – Davis defends Farrakhan by noting "many people in politics have a history of inflammatory comments" (deflects with hypocrisy charge).

### Final Verdict:  
**Verdict – 95% –** The text is highly likely propaganda. It employs **12/18 techniques** (e.g., name-calling, loaded language, reduction ad Hitlerum, bandwagon) to advance a partisan narrative. Key indicators:  
- **Selective framing**: Focuses exclusively on Democratic/left-wing figures (Davis, Obama, CBC) while contrasting them with implied Republican victimhood ("Would a Republican get a pass?").  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Uses fear ("left-wing anti-Semitism is ignored"), outrage (Farrakhan’s quotes), and tribal loyalty ("inside the house") to bypass scrutiny.  
- **Distortion of opposition**: Red herrings (Obama meeting) and straw men (media’s alleged bias) divert from substantive debate.  
- **Unverifiable claims**: Asserts media "boycott" and CBC consensus without evidence.  
While based on real events (Davis’s comments), the text’s structure—omitting counter-evidence, amplifying divisive language, and using multiple logical fallacies—aligns with propaganda’s core aim: **to persuade through manipulation rather than reasoned argument**. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges Farrakhan’s documented history, though its presentation is weaponized for ideological goals.
