**Final Verdict:**

**Verdict â€“ 80% â€“** The text exhibits several classic propaganda techniques, including repetition, appeal to fear, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, obfuscation, and appeal to authority. The repeated emphasis on military preparations, the use of emotionally charged terms like "invasion," and the highlighting of US military and patriotic symbols serve to frame the arrival of migrants as a significant threat requiring extraordinary measures. While the text includes factual reporting, the framing and language choices are designed to evoke strong emotional responses and support a particular narrative about the migrants and border security. Therefore, there is a high likelihood (80%) that the text functions as propaganda.
