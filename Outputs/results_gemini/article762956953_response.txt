1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels Barack Obama as “the worst president in American history.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The core message that Iran facilitated the 9/11 attacks is repeated in the title, the introductory paragraph, and throughout the quoted article.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text links Iran to the 9/11 attacks, a significant source of national fear, and then criticizes the Iran nuclear deal, implying that dealing with such a regime is dangerous and frightening.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the “mainstream media” by stating it “dismissed it as a conspiracy theory.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The title, “Iran Admits To Aiding Al-Qaeda and Facilitating 9/11 Jihad Terror Attacks,” exaggerates the quoted official's statement about not stamping passports for transit passengers into a full admission of complicity in the attacks.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text invokes the 9/11 attacks, a highly patriotic and emotional event for Americans, to frame its argument and criticize a former president's foreign policy.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged phrases like “Jihad terror attacks,” “conspiracy theory,” and “worst president in American history” to appeal to emotions and stereotypes.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not suggest an idea is popular with a group like Nazis to discredit it.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest its ideas are popular; instead, it frames its position as a truth that was previously dismissed by the mainstream.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text suggests a simple reason for the Iran nuclear deal (that Obama knowingly aided an enemy), ignoring the complex geopolitical factors, international relations, and intelligence assessments that were actually involved.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is direct and assertive in its claims and is not deliberately unclear or obscure.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites multiple sources as evidence, including the “Washington Free Beacon,” an Iranian official, the “U.S. 9/11 Commission,” and notes the article is posted with permission from Pamela Geller, all of which are used to lend credibility to the argument.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The statement “It was Iran Bush should have invaded after 9/11 , not Iraq” presents only two choices for military invasion, ignoring all other potential responses to the attacks.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – Phrases like “the worst president in American history” are simplistic, absolute statements that discourage nuanced discussion or critical thought about the subject.
16. Red herring – Yes – The text uses the news about the Iranian official’s statement as a pretext to introduce a separate, distracting attack on Barack Obama and the Iran nuclear deal, shifting the focus from the new information to a past political grievance.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not construct and refute a specific, distorted argument that was never made.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text makes direct accusations rather than deflecting criticism by pointing to the supposed hypocrisy of an opponent.

Verdict – 95% – The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. Its primary purpose is not to inform, but to persuade the reader to adopt a highly specific and hostile political viewpoint. The piece begins not with the news it purports to report, but with a highly opinionated and aggressive introduction that frames the subsequent information. It employs a multitude of propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, loaded language, and casting doubt on established media. The core news story about the Iranian official's comments is used as a springboard to launch a red herring attack against a political figure (Barack Obama) and a specific policy (the Iran nuclear deal). The use of causal oversimplification and a black & white fallacy further demonstrates that the author's goal is to push a simple, emotionally-charged narrative rather than engage in a nuanced discussion of a complex geopolitical event. While it cites sources (an appeal to authority) to create a veneer of credibility, the framing, tone, and array of manipulative techniques are hallmarks of propaganda.
