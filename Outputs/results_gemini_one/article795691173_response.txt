1. Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack any person or group. It refers to Khashoggi as a "dissident Saudi journalist," which is a factual description of his role, not an insult.
2. Repetition – No – The text does not repeat a specific message to influence the reader. It reports on a developing situation with new information.
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable phrases to rally support.
4. Appeal to fear – No – While the text describes frightening events ("tortured and beheaded"), it is reporting on allegations from Turkish authorities, not creating fear to support an idea.
5. Doubt – No – The text reports on a situation where there is doubt about the Saudi government's story, but the author does not use language to specifically cast doubt. It presents the facts and denials as they were stated.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – No – The text reports the facts of the situation without hyperbole or downplaying their significance.
7. Flag-Waving – No – The text does not make an appeal to patriotism. It mentions the U.S. and its relationship with Saudi Arabia in a factual, strategic context.
8. Loaded Language – No – The language used, such as "public rebuke," "suspected murder," and "mounting pressure," is strong but accurate for describing the serious diplomatic incident. It is not used to appeal to emotion beyond what the facts of the story warrant.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text makes no comparisons to Nazis or hated groups.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text reports that Mnuchin was under pressure to join other leaders and CEOs in pulling out of the conference, which describes a bandwagon effect. However, the article itself is not using the technique to persuade the reader, but rather reporting it as a fact of the situation.
11. Causal Oversimplification – No – The article presents a complex situation involving multiple international actors and pressures, avoiding a simplistic cause-and-effect explanation.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The article is clear and direct. It does report on statements from Secretary Pompeo that could be seen as vague ("a few more days"), but the reporting itself is not vague.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text quotes multiple authorities (Mnuchin, Pompeo, Trump) to report their positions, which is standard journalistic sourcing. It does not use their authority as proof of a claim's validity.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The article presents a nuanced situation with multiple perspectives and does not reduce the issue to only two choices.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use any phrases that discourage critical thought.
16. Red herring – No – The article remains focused on the Khashoggi case and the resulting diplomatic fallout without introducing irrelevant distractions.
17. Straw men – No – The text does not misrepresent anyone's argument in order to refute it.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not charge any party with hypocrisy to deflect from the main issue.

Verdict – 5% – The text is a piece of journalistic reporting, not propaganda. Its purpose is to inform the public about a developing news story. It adheres to journalistic principles by attributing statements to sources, presenting different sides of the issue (the administration's position, pressure from Congress and allies, Saudi denials), and using fact-based, neutral language. The text does not employ any of the listed propaganda techniques to manipulate the reader's opinion. It presents the facts of a complex situation and allows the reader to draw their own conclusions. The very low percentage acknowledges that any news report involves selection and framing of information, but this text does not cross the line into persuasion or manipulation.
