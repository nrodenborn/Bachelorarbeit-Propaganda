Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the text:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – "I despise Islam and I despise the ideology of Muhammad and his devout followers" (insulting label for Islam/Iranian leadership).  
2. **Repetition** – **Yes** – The poll question "Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?" is repeated verbatim three times.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – No brief, memorable phrases are used as slogans (e.g., "BUILD THE WALL" is absent).  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – "This will probably end up being another Ukraine situation" (fear-mongering about US involvement).  
5. **Doubt** – **Yes** – "Where is that authorized in our Constitution? Simple. It isn’t" (questions legitimacy of US policy).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Minimizes Iranian threat ("Iran is not an actual threat") and Saudi/Israeli vulnerability ("can fend perfectly well").  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **Yes** – References to "our Constitution," "our forefathers," and "our rights" appeal to American identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – "hell-bent," "hypocritically," "warmongering," "bondage of Islam" (emotionally charged words).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – No comparisons to Nazis/hated groups (e.g., "Vichy" example absent).  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – No appeal to popularity (e.g., "Time for US to do same" not used here).  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **Yes** – Attributes Iranian protests solely to US sanctions ("It’s due to sanctions imposed by the likes of the US").  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Arguments are direct (e.g., "Where is that authorized?" is clear).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Cites "leaked documents," Matt Agorist, and "one source close to the White House" as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents false dilemma: Focus on domestic issues or "police the world" ("Why can’t America focus on its own issues?").  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – "Simple. It isn’t" ends debate on constitutional authority.  
16. **Red herring** – **Yes** – Diverts to unrelated examples like Kurdish/Catalan independence ("Remember the Kurds? How about... Spain?").  
17. **Straw men** – **Yes** – Refutes unstated "liberal" label ("I’ll be called a liberal... honest readers know that’s not the case").  
18. **Whataboutism** – **Yes** – Charges US hypocrisy by deflecting to domestic corruption ("I see a ton of corruption... in our own government").

**Verdict – 95% –**  
The text is overwhelmingly propagandistic. It employs **12 of 18 techniques** (including loaded language, whataboutism, and fear appeals) to advance a partisan agenda. Key indicators:  
- **Persuasive intent**: Urges readers to reject US intervention ("Don't say you were not warned") while masking bias as analysis.  
- **Emotional manipulation**: Uses disdain ("despise Islam"), patriotism ("our Constitution"), and fear ("another Ukraine situation").  
- **Selective framing**: Dismisses Iranian threats but amplifies US government flaws.  
- **Source misuse**: Leaked documents and unnamed sources lend false credibility.  
- **Distraction tactics**: Red herrings (Kurds/Catalonia) and straw men ("liberal" label) avoid substantive debate.  
The 5% uncertainty reflects minimal neutral reporting (e.g., quoting Bolton’s speech), but the text’s structure, tone, and rhetorical devices overwhelmingly serve propaganda objectives.
