Verdict – 70% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, including name-calling, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, reduction ad Hitlerum, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques suggest a strong bias and attempt to persuade the audience by appealing to emotions and simplifying complex issues. While the text provides information about Julian Assange’s situation, the use of these techniques indicates a high likelihood of it being propaganda.
