### Verdict – 5% –   
The text is **not propaganda** but objective journalism. It neutrally reports facts:  
- It cites direct quotes (e.g., Patel’s jokes, organizer responses).  
- It avoids persuasive language, emotional appeals, or framing that favors one side.  
- It attributes claims (e.g., "Patel continued to claim...") and seeks comment from involved parties.  
- The 5% margin acknowledges that all reporting carries subtle bias (e.g., selecting quotes highlighting tension), but this is minimal and does not manipulate the audience. The purpose is informational, not ideological.
