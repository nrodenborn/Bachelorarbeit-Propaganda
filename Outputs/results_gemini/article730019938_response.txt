1. Name calling – No – The text does not use insulting labels to attack a subject. It refers to the suspect as a "gunman" and "perp," which are descriptive in a criminal context rather than being purely insulting labels.
2. Repetition – No – The text is short and does not repeat the same message over and over.
3. Slogans – No – The text includes the hashtag "#WestervilleStrong," but this is part of a quoted tweet from the City of Westerville, not a slogan created by the author to push their own message.
4. Appeal to fear – No – The text does not explicitly support an idea by instilling fear against an alternative. It aims to generate anger and resentment more than fear.
5. Doubt – Yes – The text questions the credibility of the Associated Press by stating, "A reminder that the Associated Press has an official policy of 'not reporting race' when it's not 'relevant'." This is intended to make the reader doubt the objectivity and trustworthiness of the news source.
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The author uses exaggeration to emphasize a point by stating, "I can't think of anything less irrelevant than a black gunman shooting two white cops". This is a form of hyperbole used to stress the author's opinion on the importance of race in this story.
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to a sense of group identity, specifically racial identity, by framing the event as "a black gunman shooting two white cops." This is designed to resonate with readers who may feel their identity group is under attack.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged language to frame the event in a specific way. The final sentence, "...a black gunman shooting two white cops--after five years of the 'Blacks Lives Matter' movement," is loaded with emotional and stereotypical connotations intended to provoke a strong reaction.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not make any comparison to Hitler or the Nazi party.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its viewpoint is popular or that the reader should agree because everyone else does.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text implies a simple causal link between a complex social movement and a specific crime by juxtaposing the shooting with "five years of the 'Blacks Lives Matter' movement." This oversimplifies the cause of the crime, ignoring the suspect's documented history of domestic violence mentioned in the same text.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author's message is direct and clear, not intentionally vague.
13. Appeal to authority – No – The text critiques a media authority (the Associated Press) rather than using an authority's support as evidence for its own argument. It references "internet detectives," which is an appeal to an informal, non-authoritative source.
14. Black & white fallacy – No – The text does not present the situation as having only two possible options or outcomes.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use clichés to shut down discussion. It seeks to provoke a specific line of thought.
16. Red herring – Yes – The author introduces the "Blacks Lives Matter" movement as a distraction from the specific facts of the case (a response to a domestic violence call involving a suspect with a history of such incidents) to reframe the event as a politically and racially motivated crime.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text creates a straw man of the "Blacks Lives Matter" movement by implying it is a direct cause of this violent act. This misrepresents the stated goals of the movement in order to attack it by linking it to a murder.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy with a "what about..." statement.

Verdict – 95% – The text is highly likely to be propaganda. It begins by presenting factual information from legitimate news sources, which lends it an initial veneer of credibility. However, the author's commentary in the second half of the text deliberately reframes these facts to promote a specific, politically charged narrative. The primary goal is not to inform the reader about the crime, but to persuade them to view the event through a lens of racial conflict and to feel animosity towards the "Blacks Lives Matter" movement and skepticism towards the mainstream media. It achieves this by employing numerous propaganda techniques, including Causal Oversimplification (linking the crime to BLM), Loaded Language (framing it as "black gunman shooting two white cops"), Doubt (questioning the AP's motives), and introducing a Red Herring (the BLM movement) to distract from the reported context of domestic violence. The combination of factual reporting with manipulative commentary is a hallmark of modern propaganda.
