1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels the imam as an “avowed enemy of the gay community,” a “Muslim extremist,” and one of the “radicals.” The Democratic Party's leadership is accused of “political bankruptcy.”
2. Repetition – Yes – The central theme of the Democratic Party's hypocrisy is repeated throughout the text, starting with the accusation of “blatant hypocrisy” and ending with the conclusion that its agenda is a “sham.”
3. Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate an idea.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text links the imam’s mosque to terrorism by mentioning the “‘Dirty Bomber’ Jose Padilla,” an “al-Qaeda Global Operations Chief,” and a plot to “blow up different South Florida structures.” This instills fear by associating the subject with violent extremism.
5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is structured to question the credibility of the Democratic Party’s stated values, as seen in the line: “This blatant hypocrisy shows the political bankruptcy of their leadership’s claims to be pro-gay and anti-bigotry.”
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the significance of a local party chapter inviting an imam to suggest the entire national Democratic Party’s platform is a “sham.” It also minimizes the imam’s links to terrorism to focus on bigotry: “While terrorism plays a huge role in his mosque’s history… Shafayat Mohamed’s personal history deals much more in bigotry than terror.”
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text frames the imam’s views as un-American by quoting his attack on the “President of the United States of America” and his support for polygamy, which it notes is “illegal in the United States.”
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases, such as “blatant hypocrisy,” “political bankruptcy,” “unapologetic vilification,” “sinister views,” and “spew intolerance.”
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – While not mentioning Hitler, the text uses the same logic by disapproving of the Democrats’ associations by linking one of their speakers, Wilfredo Ruiz, to a group that “actively promotes former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke.”
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not suggest that its position is correct because it is popular.
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text assumes a simple, sinister cause for a complex event, stating that the Democrats’ invitation to the imam “reveals their intention to pander to those in the Muslim community who spew intolerance” and proves their entire agenda is a “sham,” ignoring other potential reasons like poor vetting or local-level decision making.
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is very specific, providing names, dates, locations, and direct quotes. It is not deliberately unclear.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text uses the support of authorities as evidence, citing that a version of the Quran was “banned by the Los Angeles public school system” and that the “Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Ruiz’s AMANA.”
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents only two options: either the Democratic Party is a pure advocate for the gay community, or its entire agenda is a “sham.” It does not allow for the possibility of mistakes, poor judgment by a local chapter, or internal inconsistencies.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use simple, common phrases to shut down discussion.
16. Red herring – Yes – The main argument is about the Democratic Party’s hypocrisy regarding gay rights. The long section detailing the imam’s mosque’s connection to terrorism (“‘Dirty Bomber’ Jose Padilla,” al-Qaeda, a bomb plot) is an irrelevant distraction designed to paint the subjects as dangerous in a separate context.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an exaggerated version of the Democratic Party’s position. It sets up the idea that the party claims to be a perfect, pure advocate on all gay-related issues, an easily-refuted argument, rather than addressing the more nuanced reality of a large political coalition.
18. Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy. Instead, the accusation of hypocrisy against the Democratic Party is the central argument of the piece.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear example of propaganda. It is not an objective news report but a persuasive piece designed to promote a specific political viewpoint by discrediting an opposing one. The author selectively presents facts and employs a significant number of propaganda techniques to construct a damning narrative. The piece relies heavily on loaded language, name-calling, and emotional appeals (especially appeal to fear by linking the subjects to terrorism and white supremacy) to shape the reader's perception. It uses logical fallacies like the black & white fallacy, causal oversimplification, and straw men to frame the Democratic Party's actions in the worst possible light, presenting a complex situation as a simple case of malicious hypocrisy. The goal is not to inform neutrally but to persuade the audience that the Democratic Party is untrustworthy, dangerous, and that its entire platform is a "sham." The sheer volume and combination of these techniques confirm its nature as propaganda.
