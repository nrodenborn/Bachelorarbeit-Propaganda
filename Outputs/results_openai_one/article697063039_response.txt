### Final Verdict

**Verdict – 30% –**  
**Explanation:**  
The text is primarily a factual news report about the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, providing statistics, official statements, and updates on the situation. However, it does employ some propaganda techniques, notably appeal to fear, exaggeration/minimization, loaded language, and appeal to authority. These techniques are used to emphasize the severity of the crisis and the urgency of the situation, which could influence readers’ emotions and perceptions. Despite this, the overall intent seems to be informative rather than manipulative, and the use of these techniques is relatively mild and consistent with standard journalistic practices in crisis reporting. Thus, there is a moderate (30%) likelihood that the text is propaganda, mainly due to its emotional framing rather than any overt attempt to mislead or manipulate the audience.
