Here is the analysis of the text against each propaganda technique:

1. **Name calling** – **Yes** – Explanation: "Muslim extremists" is used as an inherently negative label to describe the compound operators, framing them as inherently dangerous and ideological.  
2. **Repitition** – **No** – Explanation: No key phrases or messages are repeated throughout the text.  
3. **Slogans** – **No** – Explanation: No brief, memorable phrases (e.g., rallying cries) are used.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – **Yes** – Explanation: Descriptions like "deplorable living conditions," "starving and needed water," and "heavily armed men" evoke fear to condemn the subjects and implicitly support law enforcement intervention.  
5. **Doubt** – **No** – Explanation: No questioning of credibility occurs; authorities are presented as reliable.  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **No** – Explanation: Claims (e.g., starvation, armed extremists) are attributed to the sheriff or investigators, with no clear independent amplification or downplaying.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – **No** – Explanation: No appeals to patriotism, national identity, or "us vs. them" nationalism.  
8. **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – Explanation: Emotionally charged terms like "deplorable," "horrifying," "starving," and "extremist[s]" evoke strong negative reactions and reinforce stereotypes.  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – **No** – Explanation: No comparisons to Nazis, Hitler, or other universally maligned groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – **No** – Explanation: No appeal to the popularity of an idea or action.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – **No** – Explanation: The text describes events without attributing complex outcomes to a single cause.  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – **No** – Explanation: Details are specific (e.g., ages of children, weapons, sources like the sheriff).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Explanation: Relies heavily on Sheriff Hogrefe’s statements (e.g., "saddest living conditions," "extremist[s] of the Muslim belief") as evidence.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **No** – Explanation: No false dichotomy is presented; the situation is described with nuance (e.g., ongoing search for the boy).  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **No** – Explanation: No phrases used to shut down critical analysis (e.g., "it is what it is").  
16. **Red herring** – **No** – Explanation: No irrelevant distractions; all details relate to the raid or missing child.  
17. **Straw men** – **No** – Explanation: No misrepresentation of opposing arguments.  
18. **Whataboutism** – **No** – Explanation: No accusations of hypocrisy targeting critics or alternatives.  

**Verdict – 20% –**  
Explanation: The text exhibits limited propaganda techniques, primarily through **loaded language** (e.g., "Muslim extremists," "horrifying compound") and **appeal to authority** (relying on the sheriff’s emotive descriptions). However, it largely reports verifiable facts (e.g., police raid, weapons found, missing child) attributed to specific sources (sheriff, Fox News, Albuquerque Journal). The focus on "Muslim extremists" risks reinforcing stereotypes, but the article avoids overt fear-mongering, oversimplification, or manipulation beyond framing. Context matters: labeling the group as "extremist" aligns with law enforcement statements, but the emphasis on religion (without broader context) could subtly bias readers. Overall, it leans toward sensationalized reporting rather than systematic propaganda, hence the low likelihood.
