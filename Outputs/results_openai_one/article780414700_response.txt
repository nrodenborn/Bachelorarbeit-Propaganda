**Verdict – 70% – The text employs several propaganda techniques, including repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, bandwagon, appeal to authority, and black & white fallacy. These techniques are used to persuade the audience to support Bishop Morlino's stance and actions regarding the issues within the Church. The presence of these techniques suggests a high likelihood that the text is propaganda, as it aims to influence the audience's perception and actions by appealing to emotions, authority, and a sense of urgency. However, not all techniques are present, and the text also provides detailed explanations and calls for specific actions, which slightly mitigates the overall propagandistic nature.**
