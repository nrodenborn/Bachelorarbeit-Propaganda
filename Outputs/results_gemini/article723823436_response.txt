1. Name calling – No – The text uses labels like "terrorist" and "jihadis," but these are used to describe the groups central to the article's claim, not as direct insults to an opponent in the argument (e.g., calling investigators "fools").

2. Repetition – Yes – The idea of "credible evidence" for a terrorist link is repeated multiple times. The text first introduces it, then quotes the congressman saying, "I’ve been made aware of what I believe to be credible evidence..." and again, "I’m just telling you I have received what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence..."

3. Slogans – No – The text does not use any brief, memorable, or catchy phrases that function as a slogan.

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The central theme of the article is that terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. through the southern border and were involved in a mass shooting, which is designed to instill fear in the audience about national security and personal safety.

5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built around casting doubt on the official investigation. It does this by asking pointed questions like, "Why would the autopsy report be something that needs to be withheld from the public or his family?" and stating, "Something’s not adding up."

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the weight of a single congressman's unsubstantiated claim ("credible evidence") while minimizing or dismissing the official findings of multiple law enforcement agencies that have found no link to terrorism.

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism and national security by focusing on the threat of "terrorist infiltration through the southern border" and the failure of "Homeland Security," framing the issue as a threat to the nation.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words and phrases to influence the reader, such as "deadly attack," "terrorist infiltration," and "infamous 'Gang of Eight'."

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an idea by suggesting it is popular with a group like the Nazis or a similar hated entity.

10. Bandwagon – No – The text presents its viewpoint as a minority or suppressed opinion fighting against the official narrative, rather than suggesting the reader should join a popular trend.

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text promotes a simple cause (ISIS terrorists crossing the southern border) for the highly complex event of the Las Vegas shooting, for which investigators have not been able to determine a clear motive.

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – The key evidence cited in the text is intentionally vague. The congressman refers to "credible evidence" and a "possible terrorist nexus" without ever providing any specific details, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks with suspicion.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The argument's primary support is the authority of a "congressman" (Representative Scott Perry) and an "Intel Group" (SITE). Their status is used as evidence for the claims being made.

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between two options: the official story is a cover-up, or the terrorist theory is the truth. It ignores other possibilities, such as the motive being complex and simply not yet discovered.

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses phrases like "Something’s not adding up" and "None of this is really that surprising" to shut down further critical thought and present its conspiratorial conclusions as common sense.

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the "infamous 'Gang of Eight'" and a past debate on immigration and border fencing. This is irrelevant to the specific evidence of the Las Vegas shooting and serves only to distract and tie the event to a separate political grievance.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text attacks the simplified position that authorities believe the border is perfectly secure ("DHS had denied Muslim terrorists were crossing the border") and then "proves" this wrong with past reports. This misrepresents the official position to make its own argument appear stronger.

18. Whataboutism – No – The text accuses officials of a cover-up and secrecy, but it does not deflect a charge of hypocrisy by pointing to a similar failing of its accuser.

***

Verdict – 95% – The text is a clear and strong example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, politically charged viewpoint by undermining the official narrative of a major tragedy. It achieves this by employing a vast number of propaganda techniques.

The entire article is built on a foundation of **doubt**, **appeal to fear**, and **appeal to authority**. It systematically questions every aspect of the official investigation while simultaneously presenting the unsubstantiated claims of a single congressman as "credible evidence." The language is intentionally vague (**obfuscation**) to create suspicion without needing proof.

It then bolsters this narrative with **loaded language** ("terrorist infiltration," "infamous"), **causal oversimplification** (blaming a complex event on a simple cause), and a **black & white fallacy** (either it's a cover-up or our theory is right). To distract from the lack of direct evidence, it introduces a **red herring** (the "Gang of Eight" immigration debate) and uses **thought-terminating clichés** ("Something's not adding up") to discourage critical analysis of its own claims. The combination of these techniques creates a powerful, persuasive, and manipulative piece designed to promote a conspiracy theory rather than engage in factual reporting.
