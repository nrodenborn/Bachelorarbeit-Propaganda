Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – Explanation: The text uses insulting labels to attack the subjects, such as calling the Democrats' actions a "despicable tactic," "lowest level of character assassination," and a "shameless smear campaign." It also refers to them as "Democrat obstructionists."

Repetition – Yes – Explanation: The text repeatedly emphasizes the "last-minute" nature of the allegation to frame it as a political tactic. Examples include: "less than a week before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote," "at the eleventh hour," and "reminiscent of how Anita Hill surfaced in a last-minute attempt."

Slogans – No – Explanation: The text is an article and does not employ brief, memorable phrases in the manner of a slogan.

Appeal to fear – No – Explanation: The text's primary emotional appeal is to anger and indignation at the perceived injustice against Kavanaugh, not to fear of a future outcome.

Doubt – Yes – Explanation: The text is fundamentally built on casting doubt on the credibility of the accuser and her story. For example: "Here is where Ms. Ford’s story becomes quite murky and begins to fall apart," and "The whole sequence of events surrounding how this allegation has suddenly come to light reeks of a set-up."

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – Explanation: The text exaggerates the Democrats' actions ("sunk to their lowest level of character assassination yet") while minimizing the allegation itself ("unsubstantiated allegation of teen sexual misbehavior," "decades-old purported teenage sexual mischief").

Flag-Waving – No – Explanation: While the subject is American politics, the text does not make a direct appeal to patriotism or national identity to support its case.

Loaded Language – Yes – Explanation: The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader's perception. Examples include "peddling an allegation," "cesspool of public gossip," and "debased themselves with a shameless smear campaign."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – Explanation: The text does not compare the opposition to Nazis or other similarly hated groups.

Bandwagon – Yes – Explanation: The text uses the letter from 65 women to suggest that a large, authoritative group vouches for Kavanaugh's character, implying the reader should agree with this popular opinion. Example: "In a letter... 65 women who said they knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school vouched for his character."

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – Explanation: The text attributes the complex situation of the allegation surfacing to a single, simple cause: a political plot. Example: "The answer is that this is all a ruse to block Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation by all means necessary."

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – Explanation: The text is not vague; it is very direct and clear in its point of view and its attacks on the opposition.

Appeal to authority – Yes – Explanation: The text cites authorities to support its claims, such as the FBI's decision not to investigate further and the letter from the 65 women. Example: "The FBI placed the letter in its background file on Judge Kavanaugh but decided not to pursue any further investigation."

Black & white fallacy – Yes – Explanation: The text presents the situation as having only two sides: Kavanaugh is an honorable man being unfairly smeared, and his opponents are contemptible liars. It leaves no room for nuance. Example: "Hypocritically exploiting an unsubstantiated allegation... Democrats... have debased themselves with a shameless smear campaign against an eminently qualified candidate."

Thought-terminating clichés – No – Explanation: The text does not use stock phrases or clichés to end discussion.

Red herring – Yes – Explanation: The text introduces irrelevant information about Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy to distract from the allegation against Kavanaugh and attack the Democrats. Example: "Feminists gave the serial sexual predator Bill Clinton a free pass... Senator Feinstein called Ted “Chappaquiddick” Kennedy an 'inspiration and a friend'".

Straw men – Yes – Explanation: The text misrepresents the Democrats' call for an investigation as a simple "ruse to block" the confirmation, ignoring their stated reason. It refutes the idea of a simple political block rather than addressing the call for an investigation on its merits. Example: "If a thorough investigation was considered to be so important, why didn't Senator Feinstein set the ball rolling back in July...? The answer is that this is all a ruse to block Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation..."

Whataboutism – Yes – Explanation: The text directly charges the opposition with hypocrisy by bringing up their past support for Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy in an attempt to discredit their current position on Kavanaugh. Example: "Feminists gave the serial sexual predator Bill Clinton a free pass... Hypocritically exploiting an unsubstantiated allegation of decades-old purported teenage sexual mischief, Democrats seeking to torpedo Judge Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation..."

***

Verdict – 100% – This text is a clear and potent example of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific, highly partisan viewpoint. It forgoes objectivity entirely, instead employing a wide array of propaganda techniques to achieve its goal. The text is saturated with loaded language and name-calling ("character assassination," "despicable tactic," "obstructionists") to create a strong emotional bias against Judge Kavanaugh's opponents from the very beginning. It systematically uses doubt, minimization, and causal oversimplification to discredit the accuser and her allegation, while presenting a black-and-white fallacy where Kavanaugh is a flawless victim and the Democrats are malicious conspirators. Furthermore, it relies heavily on logical fallacies like whataboutism and red herrings (invoking Bill Clinton, Ted Kennedy, and Anita Hill) to distract from the central issue and attack the hypocrisy of the opposition, rather than engaging with the substance of their concerns. The cumulative effect of these techniques is a one-sided, emotionally manipulative piece designed to solidify a political narrative, which is the hallmark of propaganda.
