Here are the propaganda techniques present in the text:

Name calling – Yes – The text labels the Guardian's article a "Fake News Story" and a "smear piece," and calls its author, Luke Harding, a "notorious fraud," "russo-phobe intelligence asset," and "plagiarizer."

Repetition – Yes – The core message that the Guardian story is "fake news" and that the media is untrustworthy is repeated throughout the text in various forms, such as "The story was completely false and the Guardian knew it was" and "Unfortunately no western main stream media can any longer be trusted to publish the truth."

Slogans – No – The text does not use brief, memorable phrases as rallying cries.

Appeal to fear – Yes – The text suggests a "bone-chilling" reality about journalism, where media outlets are controlled by intelligence services to push a specific agenda, creating fear of a powerful, manipulative establishment. Example: "...tells us something bone-chilling about journalism."

Doubt – Yes – The entire article is designed to cast doubt on the credibility of The Guardian and the mainstream media. The title itself, "This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted," is a direct attempt to instill doubt.

Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the implications of a single story by claiming it "Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted," and labels The Guardian a "main outlet for British government disinformation operations," which is a significant escalation from simply reporting a false story.

Flag-Waving – No – The text does not appeal to patriotism or national identity.

Loaded Language – Yes – The text is filled with emotionally charged words and phrases designed to evoke a negative response, such as "smear piece," "notorious fraud," "manipulative propaganda," "shoddier side," and "cranky identity grievances."

Reduction ad Hitlerum – Yes – The text disapproves of The Guardian by associating its methods with the Nazis. Example: "We have previously shown that the Guardian even uses fascist propaganda tropes to smear the Russian people. It is openly publishing Goebbels' cartoons and rhetoric..."

Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular.

Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text presents a simple cause for a complex issue. The title, "This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted," suggests that this single incident is sufficient proof to condemn the entire media.

Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – Yes – While the critique of the Guardian story is specific, the broader accusations are vague, referring to "British intelligence services," an "elite-serving, western narrative," and "ruling 'western interests'" without providing concrete evidence of their direct involvement in this specific case.

Appeal to authority – Yes – The text cites other writers and outlets like Glenn Greenwald, Jonathan Cook ("a former Guardian writer"), and Disobedient Media to lend credibility to its own arguments.

Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents a false dichotomy: either The Guardian made an innocent mistake (which the author dismisses) or it is a malicious propaganda outlet. Example: "The Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence. It did what it is designed to do."

Thought-terminating clichés – No – The text does not use phrases to discourage critical thought; instead, it attempts to provoke it, albeit towards a specific viewpoint.

Red herring – No – The article stays focused on its central topic: the alleged falsehood of the Guardian story and the broader implications for media trustworthiness. It does not introduce irrelevant material to distract the reader.

Straw men – Yes – The text characterizes a Politico article as suggesting the Guardian was duped by Russian disinformation, then attacks this as a predictable pattern: "When 'western' intelligence get caught in spreading disinformation, they accuse Russia of being the source of the fake." This simplifies the opposing viewpoint to make it easier to refute.

Whataboutism – No – The text does not deflect criticism of itself or its allies by accusing others of hypocrisy; it is a direct attack on its subject.

---
Verdict – 90% – The text is highly propagandistic. While it is centered on a detailed and seemingly factual debunking of a specific Guardian news story, it uses this factual core as a foundation to build a much larger, emotionally-driven, and conspiratorial narrative. The author's goal is not merely to correct the record on one story, but to persuade the reader to distrust the entire "western" media, which it portrays as a monolithic propaganda arm for state intelligence services.

It heavily employs numerous propaganda techniques to achieve this. The piece is framed with aggressive **Name Calling** ("Fake News," "fraud") and **Loaded Language** ("smear," "vilify," "shoddier"). It uses **Causal Oversimplification** and **Exaggeration** by claiming this single story "proves" all media is untrustworthy. It creates a **Black & White Fallacy** by asserting the story was not a mistake but a deliberate, malicious act ("It did what it is designed to do").

Furthermore, it makes a direct and extreme **Reduction ad Hitlerum** by comparing The Guardian's methods to Nazi propaganda ("Goebbels' cartoons"). It also relies on **Appeal to Authority** by quoting like-minded writers and on **Appeal to Fear** by describing the situation as "bone-chilling." The combination of a credible factual analysis with these numerous and powerful propaganda techniques makes the text a potent piece of propaganda, designed to promote a specific anti-establishment worldview rather than simply to inform.
