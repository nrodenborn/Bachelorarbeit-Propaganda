**Verdict – 85% – The text exhibits numerous propaganda techniques, such as name-calling, repetition, appeal to fear, doubt, exaggeration, flag-waving, loaded language, causal oversimplification, appeal to authority, black & white fallacy, straw men, and whataboutism. These techniques are employed to persuade the audience of the alleged corruption within the Church and to rally support for traditional Catholicism. While the text provides detailed accounts and testimonies, the use of these techniques suggests a strong likelihood of being propaganda, as it aims to influence the audience's perception and emotions rather than presenting a balanced and objective analysis.**
