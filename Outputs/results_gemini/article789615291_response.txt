1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels opponents with insulting terms, such as calling Democrats and their supporters “rabid partisans,” “trendoid socialists armed with torches and pitch-forks,” and referring to a lawyer as a “Creepy Lawyer.”

2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly uses the words “delay,” “delaying,” or “delaying tactic” to describe the Democrats' motivations, and the concept of “appeasement” is central to the article, appearing in the title and conclusion.

3. Slogans – Yes – The title itself, “Stop Appeasing the Democrats,” is a brief and memorable phrase. The conclusion uses another: “shoot the alligator.”

4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text warns that if Kavanaugh is not confirmed, the result will be the subversion of the Constitution to achieve the “progressive dream of government controlled and managed by a technocratic oligarchy.”

5. Doubt – Yes – The entire article is an exercise in casting doubt on the credibility of Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, for example, by stating, “Ramirez wasn’t even sure her memory was correct — until she spent six days going over it with her Democrat lawyer.”

6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the Democrats' intentions, claiming they are “ready to use any means necessary to achieve their aims, no matter how amoral, unfair, or vicious.” It also minimizes the accusers' claims, calling Ramirez’s charge “even flimsier.”

7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to patriotism by framing the conflict as a defense of the Constitution, stating that the “biggest obstacle to the progressive dream... has been the Constitution” and that Kavanaugh is a “Constitutionalist” judge.

8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words to influence the reader, such as “naked ploy,” “preemptive cringe,” “smears,” “beclown themselves,” and “caterwauling protestors.”

9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not disapprove of an idea by suggesting it is popular with a group like Nazis or other groups hated by the audience. It uses other forms of demonization, but not this specific technique.

10. Bandwagon – Yes – The text suggests that a certain viewpoint is common sense held by a desirable group, stating, “Grown-ups know all that and don’t have to be reminded every time the subject arises,” encouraging the reader to align with the “grown-ups.”

11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text reduces the complex motivations and events of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings to a single, simple cause: a partisan “ploy” by Democrats to “delay the process until after the midterm elections.”

12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The text is not vague; it makes very direct and clear accusations against the Democrats and the accusers.

13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The text quotes a respected historical figure to support its point: “To borrow Churchill’s definition of appeasement, stop feeding the alligator in the hopes that you will be eaten last.”

14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between only two options: caving to the Democrats through appeasement or acting on principle to “shoot the alligator” and “Hold the vote.”

15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text uses a phrase presented as a “timeless truth” to shut down debate: “From the playground to geopolitics, appeasing an aggressor invites only more aggression.”

16. Red herring – Yes – The text introduces the case of Mitt Romney’s “binders full of women” to distract from the specifics of the Kavanaugh case and argue that Republicans will be demonized no matter what they do.

17. Straw men – Yes – The text refutes an exaggerated version of its opponents' argument, claiming they believe “every accusation of sexual assault, no matter how much it’s unsupported by corroborating evidence or even plausibility, must be believed.”

18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text attempts to charge the opponent with hypocrisy to deflect from the issue at hand: “doesn’t Keith Ellison’s accuser deserve to be heard and believed too?”

***

Verdict – 100% – The text is unequivocally a piece of propaganda. Its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade the reader to adopt a specific viewpoint and support a particular course of action by employing a dense and varied array of propaganda techniques. The analysis reveals the use of at least 16 of the 18 listed techniques. The author consistently uses Name-calling (“rabid partisans”) and Loaded Language (“naked ploy,” “smears”) to demonize the opposition. It relies heavily on an Appeal to Fear, warning of a “technocratic oligarchy” subverting the Constitution, and Causal Oversimplification, reducing the entire complex affair to a simple partisan “delaying tactic.” The credibility of the accusers is systematically attacked using the Doubt technique. The argument is framed using a Black & White Fallacy (appease or fight) and supported by Straw Men, Whataboutism, and Appeals to Authority (Churchill). The piece is not a balanced analysis but a one-sided polemic designed to provoke an emotional response and solidify a partisan narrative.
