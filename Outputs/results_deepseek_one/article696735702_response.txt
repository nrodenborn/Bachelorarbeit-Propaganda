Here is the analysis of propaganda techniques in the text, followed by a verdict:

1. **Name calling** – Yes – "The Daily Sheeple" (derogatory label for mainstream media).  
2. **Repetition** – No – No phrase or idea is repeated persistently.  
3. **Slogans** – No – No brief, memorable phrases used for persuasion.  
4. **Appeal to fear** – No – While the topic is alarming, fear isn't leveraged to promote an alternative idea.  
5. **Doubt** – Yes – "everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny" (questions credibility of official sources).  
6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – No clear overstatement/understatement; focuses on reported inconsistencies.  
7. **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeals to patriotism or group identity.  
8. **Loaded Language** – Yes – "falling apart," "constantly changing story," "incredibly interesting" (emotive terms framing the narrative as unreliable).  
9. **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis/hated groups.  
10. **Bandwagon** – No – No appeal to popularity.  
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – No oversimplified cause assigned (e.g., doesn’t blame one factor for the shooting).  
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – Details are specific (timelines, events).  
13. **Appeal to authority** – No – Cites sources (e.g., LA Times, Twitter users) but doesn’t treat them as infallible authorities.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – Presents multiple theories (escape plan, panic, accidental suicide), not a false dichotomy.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases used to shut down debate (e.g., "it is what it is").  
16. **Red herring** – No – Stays focused on timeline inconsistencies; no irrelevant distractions.  
17. **Straw men** – No – Accurately summarizes the official timeline before critiquing it.  
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No accusations of hypocrisy against opponents.  

**Verdict – 70% –** The text exhibits hallmarks of propaganda through its use of **doubt** (undermining official narratives), **loaded language** ("falling apart," "constantly changing story"), and **name-calling** ("Daily Sheeple"). It selectively emphasizes inconsistencies in the Las Vegas shooting timeline to cast suspicion on law enforcement and media without providing evidence of malice or cover-up. While it cites factual revisions (e.g., the security guard’s shooting timeline), its framing implies deliberate deception by authorities, pushing an alternative theory (accidental suicide) as plausible without substantiation. The goal appears to be delegitimizing official accounts, aligning with propaganda that sows distrust. However, it avoids extreme techniques (e.g., fear-mongering, oversimplification), and its reliance on documented timeline changes prevents a higher percentage.
