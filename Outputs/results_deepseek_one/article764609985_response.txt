### Verdict – 65% Propaganda  
**Explanation:**  
The text employs **multiple propaganda techniques** (e.g., Name Calling, Loaded Language, Exaggeration) to frame the FBI as institutionally corrupt and politically biased. It selectively highlights aspects of the Horowitz report (e.g., Strzok’s texts) while downplaying its conclusion that no "solid proof" of political bias existed. Emotional language ("besmirching," "INSANE") and insinuations of conspiracy ("7 biased agents," "identical team") manipulate readers toward distrust. The **poll repetition** and **red herring** distract from objective analysis. However, it **retains factual elements** (direct quotes from the report, Strzok’s email) and acknowledges the IG’s lack of conclusive evidence. The blend of verifiable details with manipulative framing creates a persuasive but slanted narrative, warranting a 65% propaganda likelihood.
