Based on the definitions provided, here is the analysis of each propaganda technique in the given text:

1.  **Name calling** – No – No insulting labels are applied to Kavanaugh, the accuser, or others. Terms like "accused" and "allegedly" are factual descriptors of the situation.
2.  **Repetition** – No – The core message (the allegation and denial) is stated clearly but not repeated excessively throughout the text.
3.  **Slogans** – No – There are no brief, memorable phrases used to promote a viewpoint (e.g., no rallying cries like "Stop Kavanaugh" or "Confirm Kavanaugh").
4.  **Appeal to fear** – No – The text describes a disturbing alleged event, but it does not use this description to instill fear about broader consequences or alternatives to support a specific call to action or viewpoint.
5.  **Doubt** – **Yes** – The text reports statements specifically designed to cast doubt on the allegation's credibility and timing: "This is nothing more than a last-minute attempt at character assassination".
6.  **Exaggeration/minimization** – No – While the alleged event is severe, the text reports it using qualifiers ("allegedly," "accused," "claims"). It reports Kavanaugh's "vehement" denial and the supporting letter without clear editorial exaggeration or minimization.
7.  **Flag-Waving** – No – No appeal to patriotism or national identity is made.
8.  **Loaded Language** – **Yes** – The description of the alleged event uses emotionally charged language inherent to the accusation itself: "held a woman down, covered her mouth and tried to force himself on her," "cornered her," "blur out the sound of her protests," "managed to free herself and bolt". While reporting the allegation, this language evokes a strong emotional response.
9.  **Reduction ad Hitlerum** – No – No comparisons to Nazis or other universally hated groups are made.
10. **Bandwagon** – **Yes** – The text cites the letter from "65 women... who have known Kavanaugh since high school defended his character" and quotes Carrie Severino emphasizing "over 60 women... vouching for his integrity" to suggest broad support and imply his character is validated by this group, encouraging readers to join this perceived consensus.
11. **Causal Oversimplification** – No – The text does not present simplified causes for complex events.
12. **Obfuscation, intentional vagueness** – No – The text is relatively clear and specific about the allegations, the denial, the source of the letter, and the supporting statements.
13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – The text uses the FBI's statement ("the letter has not yet resulted in a criminal investigation") and the statements from officials (Senator, Chief Counsel) to lend weight to the reporting and the perspectives presented (both the reporting of the allegation and the defense of Kavanaugh).
14. **Black & white fallacy** – No – The text presents multiple perspectives (accusation, denial, character defense, political counter-argument) without forcing a false dichotomy.
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – No – No phrases are used to shut down critical thinking (e.g., "It is what it is," "Just trust the plan").
16. **Red herring** – No – The text stays focused on the allegation, the denial, and the surrounding political context without introducing irrelevant distractions.
17. **Straw men** – No – Arguments are reported directly (the accusation, the denial, the character defense, the "character assassination" claim). No misrepresented arguments are set up to be knocked down.
18. **Whataboutism** – No – No attempt is made to charge an opponent with hypocrisy as a way to deflect from the allegation against Kavanaugh.

**Verdict – 30% –** While the text reports factual events (an allegation, a denial, political actions, statements of support), it exhibits subtle elements of propaganda, primarily through **Loaded Language** (inherent in reporting the graphic allegation), **Bandwagon** (emphasizing the number of women supporting Kavanaugh to imply validity), **Appeal to Authority** (citing the FBI and officials), and reporting statements that employ **Doubt** (characterizing the allegation as a politically motivated "character assassination"). These techniques lean towards framing the allegation as dubious and Kavanaugh's defense as credible. However, the core structure is news reporting, presenting multiple sides, and lacks overt, heavy-handed manipulation like Name Calling, overt Fear Mongering, or blatant False Dilemmas. The propaganda elements are present but not dominant, making the text primarily informational with a discernible, though not overwhelming, slant.
