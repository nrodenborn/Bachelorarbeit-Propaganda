1. Name calling – Yes – The text labels former CIA Director Richard Helms a "perjurer" and a "liar."
2. Repetition – Yes – The text repeatedly describes the CIA's plot and cover-up as "brilliant and ingenious" and "cunning" to reinforce the idea of a highly sophisticated conspiracy.
3. Slogans – Yes – The title itself, "The Cunning CIA," acts as a short, memorable phrase that encapsulates the entire argument of the text.
4. Appeal to fear – Yes – The text creates fear around the idea of a powerful, secret government agency (the CIA) that can assassinate a president and get away with it. It also describes how the CIA allegedly manipulated the fear of nuclear war: "Lyndon Johnson gets Earl Warren and Sen. Richard Russel to join the Warren Commission by telling them that the assassination could lead to World War III."
5. Doubt – Yes – The text is built on casting doubt on the official account of the JFK assassination and the credibility of the CIA. For example, it questions the testimony of Richard Helms: "given that Helms was an admitted perjurer and convicted liar, what value does his denial that Oswald was an intelligence agent have? It has no value at all."
6. Exaggeration/minimization – Yes – The text exaggerates the nature of the alleged plot, calling it "one of the most brilliant and cunning ruses in history." It also minimizes the official investigation, for example, by referring to the "secret fraudulent and bogus autopsy."
7. Flag-Waving – Yes – The text appeals to the reader's identity as an American citizen by repeatedly highlighting how information was kept "secret from the American people," implying a betrayal of the nation's trust.
8. Loaded Language – Yes – The text uses emotionally charged words like "cunning," "perjurer," "liar," "fraudulent," and "bogus" to influence the reader's perception of the CIA and the official investigation.
9. Reduction ad Hitlerum – No – The text does not attempt to discredit an idea by associating it with a group like the Nazis or another group widely hated by the target audience.
10. Bandwagon – No – The text does not argue that its position is correct because it is popular. In fact, it presents its argument as an alternative to the widely accepted "official narrative."
11. Causal Oversimplification – Yes – The text attributes the entirety of the complex JFK assassination and subsequent investigation to a single cause: a meticulously planned CIA regime-change operation. For instance, it states the reason for the Chile operation was simply because "Allende was reaching out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship."
12. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness – No – The author’s claims, while conspiratorial, are presented directly and clearly rather than through intentionally vague or obscure language. The text accuses the CIA of obfuscation, but does not employ the technique itself.
13. Appeal to authority – Yes – The author cites "former Washington Post investigative reporter Jefferson Morley" to support the claim that the CIA was monitoring Oswald. The author also refers to his own books, such as "(See my book The Kennedy Autopsy)," positioning himself as an authority.
14. Black & white fallacy – Yes – The text presents the situation as a choice between only two options: the official narrative (portrayed as a complete lie) and the author's theory of a CIA plot (portrayed as the absolute truth), ignoring any other possibilities or nuances.
15. Thought-terminating clichés – Yes – The text points out the government's use of phrases like "national security" to justify secrecy and end discussion. It also uses its own, such as a series of rhetorical questions about Oswald ("How often have you ever heard of a U.S. Marine communist?") which are framed to discourage nuanced answers and lead to a single, predetermined conclusion.
16. Red herring – Yes – The extensive discussion of the CIA's actions in Guatemala, while presented as context, serves to distract from the lack of direct evidence for the JFK claims by building a strong negative emotional sentiment against the CIA based on a separate event.
17. Straw men – Yes – The text attacks journalist Ian Shapira for not mentioning Richard Helms' perjury conviction. Shapira's point was narrowly about a specific document being previously available, not a broad defense of Helms' character. The author refutes an argument Shapira did not make (that Helms is a trustworthy source in general) rather than his actual point.
18. Whataboutism – Yes – The text accuses the journalist Ian Shapira of hypocrisy to dismiss his argument: "But Shapira would be wise to follow his own advice because he himself is guilty of what he accuses others of." This deflects from Shapira's point by attacking him instead.

Verdict – 100% – The text is a clear and comprehensive example of propaganda. It is not a piece of objective journalism or balanced analysis; it is a polemic written with the sole purpose of persuading the reader to accept a specific, highly controversial conclusion. The author employs a vast array of propaganda techniques to achieve this goal. The entire piece is built on a foundation of casting doubt on official institutions (Doubt), using emotionally charged language to sway the reader (Loaded Language), and attacking the character of individuals who represent opposing views (Name Calling, Whataboutism). It presents a complex historical event as a simple good-versus-evil narrative (Black & White Fallacy) with a single, straightforward cause (Causal Oversimplification). The argument is bolstered by repeating key phrases (Repetition), appealing to the reader's patriotism (Flag-Waving), and presenting tangential information as damning evidence (Red Herring). The near-total reliance on these persuasive and manipulative techniques, rather than on a balanced presentation of evidence, confirms its nature as propaganda.
