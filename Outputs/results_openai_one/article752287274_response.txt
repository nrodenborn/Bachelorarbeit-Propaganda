Verdict – 60% – The text exhibits several propaganda techniques, such as name-calling, doubt, exaggeration, loaded language, and a red herring. These elements suggest an attempt to influence the reader's perception of the Awan family and the situation. However, the presence of detailed information and the lack of some other common propaganda techniques indicate that it is not entirely propaganda. The text seems to have a moderate likelihood of being propaganda, as it mixes factual reporting with elements that could sway the reader's opinion.
