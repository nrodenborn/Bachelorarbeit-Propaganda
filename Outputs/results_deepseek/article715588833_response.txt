6. **Exaggeration/minimization** – **Yes** – Exaggeration: "single worst act of tyranny in the entire history of the papacy." Minimization: Reducing Francis’s theology to "half-baked theological notions."

13. **Appeal to authority** – **Yes** – Quoting John Paul II, Saint Thomas Aquinas, and Cardinal Burke to validate claims.  
14. **Black & white fallacy** – **Yes** – Presents only two options: oppose Francis or be "cowardly"/complicit in destruction.  
15. **Thought-terminating clichés** – **Yes** – Dismissive phrases like "journey of discernment" (used sarcastically) to shut down debate.

### Verdict – 95% – Detailed Explanation  
The text is **highly likely propaganda** due to its systematic use of manipulative techniques to delegitimize Pope Francis and mobilize opposition. Key indicators:  
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Loaded language (e.g., "tyrant," "catastrophic") and appeals to fear (e.g., "irreparable damage," "apocalyptic development") dominate.  
- **Character Assassination**: Relies on name-calling ("Dictator Pope") and exaggerated claims ("worst act of tyranny in papal history") to vilify the subject.  
- **Us-vs-Them Framing**: Portrays supporters of tradition as "true children of Holy Church" and dissenters as "cowardly souls," leveraging Catholic identity (flag-waving).  
- **Selective Evidence**: Cites authorities (John Paul II, Aquinas) and sources (*The Dictator Pope*) exclusively to validate its narrative while ignoring counterarguments.  
- **Urgency and Mobilization**: Repeated calls for "hierarchical action now" and references to a "final battle" pressure readers toward immediate opposition.  
- **Lack of Nuance**: Uses black-and-white fallacies and causal oversimplification to blame Francis for all Church problems, dismissing complexities.  

While the text references real events (e.g., *Amoris Laetitia* guidelines), its **primary goal is persuasion, not balanced analysis**. It avoids engaging with theological nuances, instead weaponizing tradition and fear to demand rebellion against papal authority. The 5% uncertainty acknowledges its use of factual anchors (e.g., Canon 915), but these are embedded in a heavily biased framework. Overall, the text aligns with propaganda by seeking to provoke emotional outrage and ideological conformity rather than foster critical discussion.
